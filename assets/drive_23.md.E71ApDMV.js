A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this air flow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena.  Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes.  Paragraph: In Steve's kitchen, there are two burners. Burner A is currently not turned on, and burner B is set to \\"medium.\\" Steve was planning on cooking some fried eggs for lunch, but is currently distracted by an article in the newspaper that was deliver to his door.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which burner has a higher surface air pressure? The answer is:","output":"Burner A has a higher surface air pressure. In the given scenario, Burner A is not turned on, and Burner B is set to \\"medium.\\" Since Burner B is turned on, it is generating heat, which warms the air above its surface. As the air above Burner B gets warmer, it expands, leading to a decrease in air density in that region.  Consequently, the surface air pressure above Burner B decreases. Higher pressure regions naturally move towards lower pressure regions to establish equilibrium. Burner A, being turned off, does not produce any heat and thus has no influence on the air pressure above its surface. Therefore, it can be concluded that the surface air pressure above Burner A is higher in comparison to Burner B. This phenomenon in Steve's kitchen can be seen as a small-scale example of how pressure differences occur due to surface temperature differences, leading to the creation of air currents, and ultimately, contributing to complex weather phenomena."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A man named Michael Fagan, who was 31 at the time, had climbed a wall of Buckingham Palace, crawled through an open window and made his way to the bedroom of Queen Elizabeth II, who was sleeping. When she awakened to find the guy sitting there staring at her, it is fair to surmise that she was not pleased. Especially when Fagan asked her if she had a spare cigarette. This happened on July 9, 1982, generating international headlines, and only because the queen survived unharmed does it read like a comedy of errors. The errors were plentiful, including the queen's repeated attempts to summon help, at first to no avail. But now, 30 years later, during the celebration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in London this week, it is instructive to recall the monarch's rude awakening by the bleeding intruder who was in search of a smoke. We assume that the handful of people at the absolute pinnacle of life -- the queen being the lead example -- have the means and the staffs and the security teams to insulate themselves from indignities that mere mortals have to put up with. Analysis: Why Queen Elizabeth's jubilee celebrations matter to Brits. And, most of the time, they do. But when there are breaches of presumed privacy, boy, does it cause a commotion. Follow CNN's live jubilee blog. We don't have to go back in history to look for instances of this. Just consider what Pope Benedict XVI is thinking right now in the wake of the news that his butler, Paolo Gabriele, has been arrested, accused of having the pope's confidential documents in his home. The investigation is still playing out in Rome, but if the allegations prove true and it turns out that Gabriele, one of the few people who had access to the pope's living quarters, including the pope's desk, lifted the information, then the pope will know with certainty that even with his rarified position, he can't count on personal privacy behind the guarded walls of the Vatican. In the United States, President Ronald Reagan, after an assassination attempt on a Washington sidewalk in the second month of his first term, was assured that efforts would be redoubled to make certain no one who wished to hurt him would be able to get that close again. Nancy Reagan was said to be especially adamant that her husband be kept out of harm's way. So it was almost beyond belief one afternoon in April 1992 when Reagan, out of office but still being protected by the Secret Service, was in Las Vegas to receive an award and was accosted right onstage. Reagan had just been given the award -- a 2-foot-high crystal statue of an eagle -- when a man named Richard Paul Springer, 41, walked through the ring of security around the former president and onto the stage, grabbed the crystal eagle, smashed it forcefully to the floor (with Reagan being struck by the flying glass), and commandeered the microphone. Reagan was hustled offstage by the Secret Service, and Springer, too, was hauled away. But there was widespread incredulity that someone could get past all the federal, local and private security that is always on hand for an appearance by a president or former president. Some breaches are more comical than frightening. Elvis Presley was famously kept away from the gazes and grasping hands of his admirers when he was not performing. His privacy at home was especially important to him. But his old friends and employees sometimes tell the story of what happened when a crate arrived at his home with ventilation holes punched into it. The delivery service said that fans had sent him, as a gift, a top-pedigree dog. So, according to the story, the crate was carted into the house, and was opened. Out climbed two young women. They were escorted off the property. The persistence of those who infringe upon the privacy of the exalted can be astonishing. It turned out that Michael Fagan, the queen's uninvited visitor, had managed to sneak into Buckingham Palace a month earlier and had helped himself to a bottle of wine. For that he was charged with theft -- but was not charged criminally for the subsequent trespass that took him to her sleeping quarters, because at the time it was considered a civil violation. And Squeaky Fromme, sent to prison for a failed assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford in 1975, wrote to him while she was incarcerated -- a letter described as \\"strange\\" by Ford. She was able to reach the president once he had left office -- the letter made it to his home, and he read it -- even while she was locked away from society. The oddity of these encounters that happen when the personal space of the most protected people on the planet is violated -- the bizarreness of the moments when they are reminded that nothing in life is guaranteed -- can be both mesmerizing and haunting. Just ask Queen Elizabeth, in the unlikely event you ever get close enough. But you probably shouldn't ask her for a cigarette. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In 1982, Michael Fagan, a 31-year-old man, managed to breach security at Buckingham Palace and enter Queen Elizabeth II's bedroom while she was sleeping. The queen awoke to find Fagan sitting on her bed, wearing a soiled T-shirt and jeans, holding a broken ashtray, and bleeding from a cut on his hand. This incident, which occurred on July 9, generated international headlines and, since the queen was unharmed, is now regarded as a comedy of errors. The numerous mistakes made during this event include the queen's failed attempts to summon help and Fagan asking her for a spare cigarette. This incident reminds us that even the highest-ranking individuals in society, such as the queen, cannot always be completely insulated from the indignities that ordinary people face. Other instances of breaches in personal privacy among high-profile figures include the arrest of Pope Benedict XVI's butler, Paolo Gabriele, for allegedly having the pope's confidential documents in his possession, and an assassination attempt on former US President Ronald Reagan in 1982. While some of these breaches may be more humorous than threatening, they nevertheless highlight the fact that even the most protected individuals in the world can have their personal space violated. In the case of Queen Elizabeth, the intruder, Fagan, had actually managed to sneak into Buckingham Palace a month prior to the notorious bedroom encounter, where he helped himself to a bottle of wine. Consequently, he was charged with theft but not criminally charged for the subsequent trespass that took him to the queen's sleeping quarters since it was considered a civil violation at the time. These unexpected encounters where the personal space of those at the highest echelons of society is invaded can be both captivating and unsettling, serving as a reminder that nothing in life is definitively guaranteed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Use your syrup immediately or store it in the refrigerator.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Magic of Homemade Syrup: Immediate Use and Proper Storage Introduction: Syrups, those delectable liquid sweeteners, have long been used to enhance the flavor of various food and drinks. Whether you're drizzling it over pancakes or using it to sweeten your favorite cold beverage, syrups are versatile and delicious. Making your own syrup at home brings a whole new level of customization and satisfaction. In this article, we'll discuss the importance of using your homemade syrup immediately or storing it in the refrigerator to ensure the best results in terms of taste and safety. Step 1: Making Your Syrup Homemade syrups are incredibly simple and easy to make. All you need are a few key ingredients such as sugar, water, and any additional flavorings you prefer (e.g., vanilla, cinnamon, or fruit extracts). Combine these ingredients in a saucepan and heat gently until the sugar has dissolved entirely. Continue to simmer your mixture for a few minutes to thicken and deepen the flavors. Step 2: Use Your Syrup Immediately Once your syrup is ready, it is best to use it immediately. This not only guarantees the optimum flavor but also ensures that you enjoy a smooth and velvety texture. Freshly made syrup is perfect for enhancing your morning pancakes or waffles, sweetening your hot beverages, or even drizzling over your favorite desserts like ice cream or fruit salads. Step 3: Proper Storage in the Refrigerator If you have made more syrup than you can use immediately or wish to save some for later, proper storage is essential. Cool the syrup to room temperature before transferring it into a clean, airtight container. Glass jars or bottles with secure lids work best for syrup storage. Storing your syrup in the refrigerator helps maintain its freshness and quality. The low temperature slows down any microbial activity, preventing spoilage and extending the shelf life of your homemade syrup. Most homemade syrups can last anywhere between four to six weeks when stored in the refrigerator. Step 4: Reusing and Reheating Your Syrup When you decide to use the stored syrup, make sure you check for any signs of spoilage such as off-odors, mold, or abnormal texture. If your syrup appears to be in good condition, warm it gently in a saucepan over low heat or in the microwave for a few seconds to achieve the desired consistency. Using a clean spoon, stir the syrup well to ensure even heating and flavor distribution. Conclusion: Homemade syrup adds a delightful touch of sweetness and flavor to everyday meals and treats. By using your syrup immediately or storing it carefully in the refrigerator, you'll ensure that you enjoy the magic of homemade syrup at its finest. So, why not try your hand at making your own syrup and experience the satisfaction of enhancing your dishes with your signature touch?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid empire for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The process of becoming culturally more Greek that colonizers did not bestow on most locals was known as \\"Hellenization.\\" Step-by-step: 1.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Hillary Clinton blasted for hugging girl after collapse despite having pneumonia HILLARY CLINTON has been blasted for hugging a young girl after collapsing at yesterday’s 9/11 ceremony – despite knowing that she was suffering from contagious pneumonia. A wave of criticism has flooded in as new footage emerged from an alternative angle showing the presidential wannabe swaying before she is helped into the back of a van. The Democratic candidate was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday before she took a tumble at yesterday's \\"incredibly stifling\\" 9/11 memorial service. The illness is spread from person-to-person when people breathe in tiny particles that make it into the air. Someone can easily be infected when a sufferer sneezes while in close proximity to them. Pneumonia causes swelling of the tissue on one or both lungs and symptoms include coughing, rapid heartbeat, fever, and chest pain. Clinton was taken to back to her daughter's apartment after he collapse yesterday and emerged looking happy and relaxed. She then smiled and posed for pictures as she embraced a young girl. The photo-op has been roundly criticised on social media with Twitter user Ed Hansberry posting: \\"Wait? She has pneumonia so bad she passed out from it, yet hugs a little girl today? #HillarysHealth\\" Vic Niederhoffer tweeted: \\"You have to admire someone so healthy she cares to hug a little girl just a day into pneumonia (sic)\\" Matt Walsh tweeted: \\"Why did Hillary Clinton risk exposing this little girl to pneumonia?\\" Clinton has slammed for the move amid reports talks are taking place in the Democratic camp over who might be best placed to replace her in the presidential race . Her opposing candidate Donald Trump has since spoken out and told Fox News that he hoped Clinton would \\"get well soon\\". He said: \\"I just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail and we'll be seeing her at the debate.\\" Clinton was due to leave this morning for a two-day trip to California that included fundraisers and a speech on the economy. But on doctor's orders the 68-year-old was forced to cancel the trip. Clinton's doctor Lisa Bardack said in statement: \\"Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. \\"She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. \\"While at this morning's event, she became overheated and dehydrated. \\"I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.\\" The presidential candidate tried to hose down concerns around her health saying that she was \\"feeling great\\" as she left her daughter's apartment. She yelled to press across the street from Chelsea Clinton's apartment: \\"It's a beautiful day in New York.\\" But yesterday's collapse and the cancellation of her California trip is likely to add fuel to internet rumours about her alleged poor health. Footage of Clinton's collapse shows her resting on a concrete barrier as she struggles to stay on her feet. Helpers desperately tried to keep her upright before ushering her into the van. She appears to almost fall to the floor before she is bundled into the vehicle and whisked away. A source told Fox News that Clinton's knees appeared to buckle as she left the service. A spokesman for Clinton, Nick Merrill, said Clinton had attended the service for an hour and 30 minutes. He said: \\"Secretary Clinton attended the September 11th Commemoration Ceremony for just an hour and thirty minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen. \\"During the ceremony , she felt overheated so departed to go to her daughter's apartment, and is feeling much better.\\" MORE ON #HILLARY per witness: \\"unexpected early departure\\"; she stumbled off curb, \\"knees buckled\\", lost a shoe as she was helped into van — RickLeventhalFoxNews (@RickLeventhal) September 11, 2016 Fox News also reported that the former Secretary of State had to wait for her motorcade for several minutes as her security detail had not realised she would be leaving early. Clinton arrived at the New York ceremony in the morning, wearing dark glasses, having released a statement saying it was important to honour the lives and \\"tremendous spirit\\" of the victims and responders of September 11, 2001. She and opposing candidate Donald Trump both attended the morning service to mark 15 years on from the September 11 attacks, with Trump remaining after she had left. Clinton has been plagued by speculation that she is not fit enough to serve as US President. She was even jokingly challenged to show she could open a jar of pickle to prove she was in good health. The candidate also had her pulse taken as part of the joke. Clips of Clinton appearing to cough up green mucus also sent ripples through the presidential race. Clinton had a coughing fit while speaking at a rally in Cleveland, Ohio, and was forced to take a moment to sip some water and recover. Her opposing candidate Trump has used the incidents to claim that Clinton is too weak to serve as the US president, also saying she takes too many naps to properly serve. He also said he had \\"no idea\\" what had happened to Clinton when he was asked about her health following the ceremony. Trump also said he had \\"no idea\\" what had happened to Clinton when he was asked about her health following the ceremony. Clinton emerged from her daughter Chelsea's home two hours after collapse walking unaided and waving to reporters. The Democratic candidate repeatedly said she \\"felt great\\" when asked by journalists but failed to answer questions about what exactly happened. We pay for your stories!

Article: SALT LAKE CITY — Republican Donald Trump appears to have, in his earlier words, \\"a tremendous problem in Utah\\" as a new poll shows him slipping into a dead heat with Democrat Hillary Clinton since crude comments he made about women surfaced last weekend.      And along with the billionaire businessman's sudden fall, independent candidate and BYU graduate Evan McMullin surged into a statistical tie with the two major party presidential nominees, according to survey conducted Monday and Tuesday by Salt Lake City-based Y2 Analytics.      \\"A third-party candidate could win Utah as Utahns settle on one,\\" said Quin Monson, Y2 Analytics founding partner.      McMullin may well have caught lightning in a bottle.      The poll shows Clinton and Trump tied at 26 percent, McMullin with 22 percent and Libertarian Gary Johnson getting 14 percent if the election were held today. Y2 Analytics surveyed 500 likely Utah voters over landlines and cellphones Oct. 10-11 The poll has a plus or minus 4.4 percent margin of error.      Also, a majority of voters statewide and specifically Mormons, as well as a near majority of Republicans, say Trump should drop out of the race, according to the poll.      The poll shows that 94 percent of Utahns have watched or heard about the video in which Trump had an extremely lewd conversation about women caught on a hot microphone in 2005. Y2 Analytics managing partner Scott Riding called that high percentage \\"astounding\\" for political news.      Those who viewed the video felt more strongly that Trump should step aside than those who only heard about it, according to the poll. Republicans, however, are split over whether Trump should go.      A cascade of rank-and-file Republicans and GOP leaders in Utah abandoned their support for Trump soon after the video became public. A BYU political science professor described the reaction in Utah as a \\"full-scale revolt\\" against Trump.      Gov. Gary Herbert and Utah Reps. Jason Chaffetz and Chris Stewart were among those announcing they would no longer vote for their party's nominee. The Deseret News called for Trump to resign his candidacy.      \\"It's quite the cacophony of voices coming from this state,\\" Monson said, adding that doesn't appear to be happening to the same degree nationally or in other states. \\"Utah continues to be quite different in its rejection of Donald Trump.\\"      Clinton, too, though hasn't captured Utahns' hearts. Both she and Trump have unfavorability ratings of about 70 percent, according to the poll.      \\"These are very deeply disliked candidates,\\" Riding said.      McMullin’s ballot strength is striking considering that only 52 percent of voters are aware enough of his candidacy to offer an opinion, according to Y2 Analytics. However, among those that recognize his name, four out of five see him favorably.      Boyd Matheson, president of the conservative Sutherland Institute, said there's a distinction in Utah that's becoming more apparent nationally that voters aren't going to settle for political rhetoric on either side of the aisle.      \\"It doesn't matter if it's Trump or Clinton, Utahns are saying, 'No, that's not what leadership looks like to us,'\\" Matheson said.      Monson said the \\"implosion\\" of the Trump campaign has led to the GOP nominee's share of the vote falling and support migrating to Johnson and more so McMullin. Clinton's numbers have stayed about the same.      Born in Utah, McMullin, a former CIA agent and policy director for U.S. House Republicans, entered the race in August as a conservative alternative to the majority party candidates.      McMullin soundly beats Trump among those in the poll who identified themselves members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.      Matheson said McMullin has a unique window over the next five days to come out with an agenda and invite Utahns to be part of something. If so, he could scoop up the Johnson \\"placeholder\\" votes, as well as take some from Trump and Clinton.      \\"There's a plausible path that Evan McMullin could win Utah,\\" Matheson said.      McMullin responded to the poll Wednesday, saying Utahns can turn the election around, putting him on the path to be the first third party candidate for president to win a state since pro-segregation candidate George Wallace in 1968.      \\"Utahns have a special place in this election. What we kept hearing would be impossible, has now happened,\\" McMullin said. \\"This is just the beginning and we will continue to grow our movement well beyond Utah.\\"      His campaign said website traffic and volunteer sign ups have jumped more than 400 percent since last month.      Trump held a double-digit lead over Clinton, 37 percent to 25 percent, in a UtahPolicy.com poll conducted in August by Dan Jones & Associates. Johnson picked up 16 percent in that survey, which was done before McMullin entered the race.      A Public Policy Polling survey of likely Utah voters showed Trump ahead of Clinton 39 percent to 24 percent.      Despite his lead in the polls, Trump acknowledged a \\"tremendous problem in Utah\\" during an August campaign speech in Florida to evangelical pastors, saying \\"Utah is a different place.\\"      Meantime, seeing a rare opportunity for a Democrat to make inroads in Utah, the Clinton campaign opened an office in Salt Lake City.      In March, before either Trump or Clinton had won their respective party nominations, a Deseret News/KSL poll found Utahns poised to vote for a Democrat for president for the first time since 1964.      Clinton had a slight edge over Trump, 38 percent to 36 percent, while Democrat Bernie Sanders led Trump 48 percent to 37 percent among likely Utah voters, according to the survey conducted by Dan Jones & Associates.      Also, 16 percent said they would skip the election if Trump and Clinton were their ballot choices.      Utah voters rejected both Trump and Clinton in the March presidential preference caucus votes. Republicans gave Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a big win over both Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Trump, while Democrats did the same for Sanders.      Read more about the poll here.      Contributing: Lisa Riley Roche      Email: [email protected], Twitter: dennisromboy ||||| With the election only weeks away, Hillary Clinton appears to have the lead and the momentum. As of this writing, the FiveThirtyEight polls-only forecast gives her around an 87 percent chance of winning — up from around 55 percent in late September – and that may not have fully absorbed the fallout of Trump’s lewd video, debatable debate performance or the daily deluge of fresh scandal jeopardizing his candidacy.      But if Clinton doesn’t run away with this, there is another candidate who may also have seen his chances of becoming president skyrocket. The third-most likely person to be the next president of the United States: Evan McMullin.      It would take a fascinating scenario — in which much of the technical detail of how we select presidents comes into play — for McMullin to be sworn in as the 45th president, but the chances of its happening are slim, not none. Indeed, his chances of at least making things very interesting may be as high as 1 to 3 percent — about the same as the odds of the Cubs’ coming back to beat the Giants on Monday.      If you’ve never heard of this person, you’re not alone. With #NeverTrumpers failing to get Mitt Romney, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska or any other high-profile Republicans to enter the race, the task to mount a conservative challenge fell to McMullin, a little-known, 40-year-old former CIA officer.      According to the bio on his website, he served in the CIA for about a decade, and spent time in investment banking, as an adviser for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and as policy director for the House Republican Conference. On the issues, McMullin has taken fairly orthodox Republican positions, including supporting free trade. He has been critical of Trump on immigration, refugees, anti-Muslim rhetoric and on temperament and fitness to be president.      The idea that an independent candidate could swoop in to win has been largely dismissed, on the grounds that any conservative-leaning third-party candidate would be more likely to hurt Trump than Clinton, thus making a Clinton victory more likely. But McMullin may have one advantage that other second-tier candidates do not: Utah.      His path to the presidency basically looks like this:      Win Utah Deadlock the Electoral College Win in the House      Step 1: Win Utah      For step 1, his chances are arguably pretty good. Perhaps there has been no more dire sign that the Trump campaign is struggling than a recent Deseret News poll showing Trump in a dead heat with Clinton in the highly conservative state. But with both major-party candidates getting only 26 percent, the real bombshell is the third-place finisher.      McMullin is already polling within striking distance of the leaders, despite his much lower name recognition. Another recent poll showed McMullin a bit further behind, but with Trump still only getting 34 percent of the vote to McMullin’s 20 percent.      The FiveThirtyEight model has just been updated to include McMullin in Utah (Nate Silver will have more on how we did that), presently giving him a 3.4 percent chance of winning based on current polling, with the “now-cast” giving him a 9.7 percent chance if the election were held today. But there are a number of reasons I’d be significantly more bullish on McMullin’s chances in his home state.      First, McMullin is a Mormon, and while Utah is a deep red state, the heavily Mormon population has not embraced Trumpism. In the Utah Republican Caucuses in March, Trump finished in 3rd place with just 14 percent of the vote.      Meanwhile, in those same caucuses, the candidate whom Mitt Romney announced he would vote for — Ted Cruz — received 69 percent of the vote. It’s hard to overstate Romney’s popularity and influence in Utah, and his endorsement could easily put McMullin over the top. (Oh, and McMullin is reportedly using a Romney email list already.)      Step 2: Deadlock the Electoral College      And now we get to the heart of the issue: Utah could be enough.      While McMullin essentially has no chance of winning the election outright, Utah’s six electoral votes could be enough to block any candidate from winning 270 in the electoral college, thus sending the election to Congress.      While people speculate about “ties” every cycle, this election may give us our best chance for the equivalent in a long while, though the chances still aren’t good. The model currently puts the chances of a tie at just 0.4 percent — but that is without giving McMullin much of a chance in Utah. Our polls-only forecast estimates about a 1.7 percent chance of Trump’s winning 269-275 electoral votes, including Utah (polls-plus has it as high as 2.4 percent). Any of those would be enough that flipping Utah into McMullin’s column would deadlock the Electoral College.      An interesting point about that number is that it’s relatively insensitive to how far Trump is behind. Of course, a close race would be ideal for McMullin, but the chances of the election finishing within the margin of Utah in late September when it was close were still only around 3.1 percent. Essentially, if the race is close, it’s a narrow band between a clear Clinton victory and a clear Trump victory. But if the race isn’t close, it’s a narrow band in the upper range of possible Trump rebounds. So while the odds of a Trump victory have plummeted, the odds of a McMullin miracle — assuming he wins Utah — remain somewhat steady.      Step 3: Win in the House      After that, the 12th Amendment dictates that the top three presidential vote-getters’ names are sent to the incoming House, with each state delegation getting one vote. The top two electoral-vote-receiving vice presidential candidates are sent to the Senate.      The Republican Party, of course, enjoys a significant edge in House delegations and controls 33 of the 50 states. While most project them to lose seats in the election, the scenario we’re interested in — in which Trump rebounds to win nearly half of the electoral votes — would probably not be the disaster it would take for the Republicans to lose nine delegations.      Fortunately for McMullin, Republicans haven’t shown Trump a lot of loyalty. Unprecedented numbers of congressional leaders have already abandoned their nominee – and that’s under the working assumption that Clinton is the only alternative.      Moreover, it takes an outright majority at this stage for a candidate to win. Based on known defections, somewhere around 35 congressmen are already anti-Trump (to varying degrees), including a majority of Utah’s delegation, and a majority of the Republicans in Nevada’s.      So let’s say the Democrats pick up a couple of states in the election, while Utah and Nevada go for McMullin and persuade a few other Republican states to join them right away, such that the breakdowns goes something like – with 26 needed to win — 19 delegations for Clinton, 23 for Trump and eight for McMullin.      Now what? Unlike the Electoral College, the House doesn’t just give up — they get to keep going until Inauguration Day. At that point, if the House delegations are still deadlocked, the vice president becomes president.      Meanwhile, the vice president would likely be known. Since the Senate can only choose between the top two candidates (presumably Kaine and Pence), it would take a perfect tie for them to remain deadlocked.      So here’s the rub: Whichever side loses in the Senate might have good reason to make a deal with a McMullin contingent in the House. That is, if Kaine is VP and the McMullin contingent holds fast, the party-loyal Republican coalition may be pressured to accept McMullin as better than Clinton (who would win if McMullin states sided with the Democrats) or Kaine (who would become president if the House remained deadlocked). While if Pence wins in the Senate, the Democrats may be pressured to accept McMullin rather than Trump or Pence — especially if they make deals for political appointments or legislative commitments. While this may sound shady by U.S. norms, it’s not unlike what happens in parliamentary systems around the world.      The upshot, however, is a bit bizarre. If you’re pro-McMullin or anti-Trump enough that this scenario excites you, congrats. But unless you’re in Utah or other states come into play, there’s not much you can do about it. If McMullin cuts into the Trump vote enough to give Clinton plurality wins in potential red states, her victory is assured.      In other words, if McMullin gets too strong, he could literally cost himself the election. The only route to the presidency McMullin can take must be navigated on the back of a dark horse. |||||Summary:","output":"A new poll has revealed a potential upset in the US election, showing independent candidate Evan McMullin in a statistical tie with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Utah. The poll shows Clinton and Trump tied at 26%, McMullin with 22%, and Libertarian Gary Johnson receiving 14%. McMullin, a BYU graduate and former CIA agent, is appealing to Utahns unsettled by Clinton and Trump and may emerge as a possible third-party candidate. His success in Utah could be enough to block any candidate from winning 270 electoral votes, resulting in a deadlocked electoral college, throwing the election into the US House of Representatives, providing an alternative path to the presidency."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is also ambassador for Operation Smile.  - Sir Charles Spencer \\"Charlie\\" Chaplin, (16 April 1889  25 December 1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame during the era of silent film. Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona \\"the Tramp\\" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.  - Silent Movie is a 1976 American satirical comedy film co-written, directed by, and starring Mel Brooks, and released by 20th Century Fox on June 17, 1976. The ensemble cast includes Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, Bernadette Peters, and Sid Caesar, with appearances by Anne Bancroft, Liza Minnelli, Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Marcel Marceau, and Paul Newman playing themselves.  - Little Tramp is a musical with a book by David Pomeranz and Steven David Horwich and music and lyrics by David Pomeranz.  - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.  - By the Sea is a 1915 film Charlie Chaplin made while waiting for a studio to work in Los Angeles . He just left Niles Essanay Studio after doing five films at that location . By the Sea was filmed all on location at Crystal Pier in April 1915 .

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: U.S. Army pilot Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), last aware of being on a mission in Afghanistan, wakes up on a commuter train[6] to Chicago, at 7:40 am. To the world around him â including his traveling partner Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) and the bathroom mirror â he appears to be Sean Fentress, a school teacher. As he comes to grips with this revelation, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard. Stevens regains consciousness inside a dingy dim cockpit, leaking oil. Communicating through a video screen, Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) verifies Stevens' identity, and insists he stay \\"on mission\\" to find the bomber before a large \\"dirty bomb\\" hits downtown Chicago in six hours. Inside the \\"Source Code\\" experimental device designed by scientist Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person's life within an alternative timeline.[a] Stevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code repeatedly in frustrating, exhausting attempts to learn the bomber's identity. He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina, escaping the explosion. Other times he cannot locate or disarm the bomb and dies on the train. But Rutledge insists the alternate timeline is not real. It is revealed that he has been \\"with them\\" for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan. He is comatose and missing most of his body, hooked up to neural sensors. The cockpit capsule is in his imagination, his brain's way of making sense of a missing environment. A confused and frustrated Stevens asks, \\"As one soldier to another, am I dead?\\" Angry to learn that he is on life support, he asks to be disconnected after the mission. Rutledge agrees. Stevens catches the bomber Derek Frost (Michael Arden), who leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death, and gets off at the last stop before Chicago. In one run-through, Frost kills both Fentress and Christina, and flees in a rented white van. Stevens remembers the license... Answer:","output":"Based on the movie plot provided, a possible question could be: \\"How does Captain Colter Stevens utilize the 'Source Code' device in his mission to find the bomber before a dirty bomb hits downtown Chicago?\\"  This question covers a key part of the plot, namely Stevens' use of the \\"Source Code\\" device, his mission, and his struggle to find the bomber within the timeframe set.

Missing American found dead in Mexican mountains MEXICO CITY (AP) — Searchers on Friday found the body of an American man who had been missing in the rugged mountains in central Mexico since going on a hike four days ago. Carlos Mandujano, the civil defense coordinator for Morelos state, said a search team found the lifeless body of Hari Simran Singh Khalsa, 25. He was found in one of the narrow gorges or ravines that crisscross the rugged mountains in the colonial town of Tepoztlan, not far from where he was last seen in a picture of himself that he sent by cellphone. \\"He has been found, but unfortunately, dead,\\" Mandujano said. \\"We don't know the cause of death yet; that will be determined by the autopsy.\\" Khalsa's family and friends said in a statement later that he apparently died from a fall. \\"He appears to have fallen while hiking and sustained a fatal injury to the head,\\" it said. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City also confirmed the death. It said it was offering consular support to Khalsa's family and extended the U.S. government's condolences. While helicopters and hundreds of police and rescue workers combed the craggy mountains and cliffs around Tepoztlan this week, it appears Khalsa never went very far. The body \\"was in the same wooded area, but the thing is that it is very rough terrain,\\" Mandujano said. The search began Tuesday after Khalsa didn't return from going on a hike in Tepoztlan, about an hour south of Mexico City, with only a T-shirt, shorts, and little food and water, said his wife, Ad Purkh Kaur. Kaur said Friday from Tepoztlan that her husband was a yoga instructor born and raised in Brooklyn. The couple have been living in Leesburg, Virginia, but were planning to move back to Brooklyn at the end of the month. Kaur, whose legal name is Emily Smith, said she and her husband arrived in Tepoztlan for a yoga retreat Dec. 26. Tepoztlan, a frequent weekend getaway for Mexico City residents, is known for the towering, whimsically shaped cliffs and mountain peaks that tower over the colonial town on the valley floor. Kaur said she heard from her husband at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, when he sent a picture of himself on a mountain top pointing to the site of the yoga retreat, with the message: \\"Looking down on you!\\" She last heard from him about two hours after that, when he sent a text message. \\"I accidentally summited another mountain,\\" he wrote, Kaur said. \\"Looks like I'll be a little later coming back.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The Arrhenius definition of acids and bases is somewhat limited. There are some compounds whose properties suggest that they are either acidic or basic, but which do not qualify according to the Arrhenius definition. An example is ammonia (NH 3 ). Its aqueous solution turns litmus blue, it reacts with acids, and displays all the other properties of a base. However, it does not contain the hydroxide ion. In 1923, a broader definition of acids and bases was independently proposed by Danish chemist Johannes Brønsted (1879-1947) and English chemist Thomas Lowry (1874-1936). A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a molecule or ion that donates a hydrogen ion in a reaction. A Brønsted-Lowry base is a molecule or ion that accepts a hydrogen ion in a reaction. A hydrogen ion is commonly referred to as a proton, and so acids and bases are proton donors and proton acceptors respectively according to the Brønsted-Lowry definition. All substances that are categorized as acids and bases under the Arrhenius definition are also defined as such under the Brønsted-Lowry definition.

If I tell you that Gene segments are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do, and ask you the question \\"what are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do?\\", is the correct answer \\"heat or cold\\"?","output":"No, if you say that Gene segments are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do, the correct answer to the question \\"what are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do?\\" would not be \\"heat or cold\\". Rather, the correct response should be \\"gene segments\\" or \\"genes\\" in broader terms. Let me explain this in more detail. In living organisms, the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) contains all the necessary genetic information required for the cells' development, functioning, and reproduction. DNA is made up of genes, which are the segments of DNA that code for specific proteins or have specific regulatory functions. Thus, genes are the units of heredity, conveying the necessary instructions for the development and functioning of cells and the whole organism. The genetic code is a set of rules that specify the correspondence between the nucleotide triplets called codons and the amino acids that make up proteins. When a cell needs a particular protein, a process called transcription occurs, which creates a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) as a temporary copy of the DNA gene. The mRNA then moves to the ribosomes in the cell – the protein-building factories – where a process called translation occurs. In this process, transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry amino acids to the ribosomes, where they are joined together to form proteins based on the sequence of mRNA. Consequently, each gene segment encodes specific instructions for assembling amino acids in the correct sequence, which ultimately determines the structure, function, and behavior of proteins. On the other hand, \\"heat or cold\\" refers to environmental factors that can influence cellular activities, such as metabolism or stress responses, but they do not directly encode instructions for cells. External factors, like temperature, can affect the rate of biochemical reactions within cells, including the processes of transcription, translation, and protein folding. However, the cell has multiple mechanisms in place to mitigate and respond to changes in temperature, including heat shock proteins, cold shock proteins, and other molecular chaperones that assist in protecting cellular proteins from denaturation or misfolding. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question is \\"gene segments\\" or simply \\"genes.\\" These structures in DNA hold the essential information that controls cellular functions by encoding instructions for the creation of proteins. While environmental factors such as \\"heat or cold\\" may influence the cells' functions, they do not carry any direct instructions for the cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before the Country Music Hall of Famer passed away this April at the age of 81, he had been planning a November 22 farewell concert at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville along with some guest performers. Last night the concert went ahead as planned with country’s shining stars paying tribute to the “King of Broken Hearts.” Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, George Strait, Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton were among the performers who took part in the almost four hour concert. In contrast to Jones’s funeral, a somber affair at the Grand Ole Opry House, this event was laced with laughter and fond memories. Country duo Big & Rich entered the stage atop riding mowers to warble “Love Bug,” while Vince Gill sang “Bartender’s Blues,” clad in a T-shirt that read “Sweet Pea,” the nickname Jones had bestowed upon him. After Brad Paisley sang “The One I Loved Back Then (The Corvette Song),” The Tennessean reported that he told the audience, “No was more generous to me than George Jones,” then adding, “I know he’s looking down at this and saying, ‘Son, where’s all the money goin’ for this?’” The evening ended on a poignant note with Alan Jackson performing “He Stopped Loving Her Today,” a tune he had sung at the funeral but this time he was joined by Jones’s widow, Nancy for the final choruses.

When we engage in activities or possess things that bring us joy, it can contribute to our overall sense of well-being and happiness. However, it is important to recognize that these feelings of happiness are often temporary. Maintaining a sense of contentment and well-being requires a balance of different aspects in our lives, such as physical health, mental health, relationships, and personal achievements. Firstly, engaging in activities that promote physical health, such as exercise, helps in maintaining overall happiness. Physical activity is known to release endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that act as natural mood elevators. Regular engagement in exercise can also improve sleep patterns and increase energy levels, which in turn affect our overall mood and well-being. Secondly, mental health is another critical aspect of happiness. This can involve fostering a positive outlook on life, developing coping strategies for managing stress, and practicing mindfulness or engaging in therapeutic activities to address any underlying personal issues. Engaging in activities that nurture our mental health can help in maintaining a sense of balance and well-being. Moreover, relationships with friends, family, and loved ones play a significant role in our happiness. Cultivating positive and supportive relationships can provide us with a sense of belonging and help us navigate through life's challenges. Open communication, trust, and empathy are essential components of healthy relationships that contribute to long-term happiness. Lastly, personal achievements contribute to our sense of self-worth and satisfaction. These accomplishments can vary greatly from person to person, as different individuals are driven by unique goals and ambitions. Engaging in activities and pursuits that align with one's interests and values can often lead to a greater sense of fulfillment and happiness. In conclusion, while material items or experiences can make us feel happy for a while, it is essential to recognize that maintaining long-term happiness requires a balance of various aspects of our lives. Good physical health, mental health, relationships, and personal achievements contribute to building a strong foundation for sustained contentment and well-being. Investing time and effort in these areas can help us maintain happiness even when momentary joys fade."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question. Here is a list of attributes and associated contrastive words that may help write contrastive trigger words. Note that contrastive trigger words help in flipping the label. | Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword |  | age | old | new |  | altitude | low | high | | area | small | vast |  | brightness | dark | light |  | clarity | obscure | clear |  | cleanness | dirty | clean |  | complexity | simple | complex |  | cost | cheap | expensive | | density | sparse | dense | | depth | shallow | deep | | distance | near | far |   | electric conductivity | low | high | | flexibility | rigid | flexible | | granularity | fine | coarse |  | hardness | soft | hard |  | length | short | long |  | magnitude | small | large |  | mass | small | large |  | odor | weak | strong |  | pressure | low | high |  | resistance | low | high |  | shape | round | sharp | | shape | flat | spiky | | size | small | large |  | sound | quiet | loud |  | sound pitch | low | high |  | speed | slow | fast |  | stability | unstable | stable |  | strength | weak | strong |  | temperature | low | high |  | texture | smooth | rough |  | thermal conductivity | low | high | | thickness | thin | thick |  | volume | small | large | | weight | light | heavy |  | width | narrow | wide |  | location | in | out | | location | up | down | | location | above | below | | location | on | off | | location | to | from | Q: Context Word: shrink.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","output":"It is declared as National Cultural Heritage of Slovakia. The Medieval City of Levoca is inscribed in the UNESCO Heritage List. The Medieval City of Levoca, located in eastern Slovakia, is a prime example of a historic town that has managed to preserve its architectural wealth and cultural heritage throughout the centuries. Declared as part of the National Cultural Heritage of Slovakia, this medieval gem is also inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, further elevating its significance and ensuring continued efforts to preserve and protect it for generations to come. Levoca is well-known for its remarkably preserved city center, which boasts a number of notable structures that continue to hold historical, architectural, and even artistic value. The town's layout, including its central square, harks back to the prosperity and influence Levoca enjoyed during the 14th to 16th centuries as a leading center of trade, culture, and education in the region. One of the most iconic buildings in Levoca is St. James Church, a Gothic masterpiece constructed between the 14th and 15th centuries. This church houses the tallest wooden altar in the world, standing at a staggering 18.6 meters (61 feet) high. It was masterfully created by renowned carver and artist Master Pavol of Levoca and is considered a crowning achievement of Gothic craftsmanship. The ornate wooden altar is a magnificent sight, adorned with intricate carvings and depictions from the Bible. Also worth mentioning is the Old Town Hall, a carefully preserved building that showcases stunning Renaissance architecture. Renovated in the 16th century in the Renaissance style, the Town Hall now serves as the Levoca City Museum, housing a collection of artifacts and documents that provide an insight into the city's rich history. Visitors to the museum will encounter evidence of Levoca's past as a hub of commerce and a stronghold of the Hungarian Kingdom. The town fortifications are another architectural marvel, with remnants of the original stone walls still encircling much of the city. The walls played a crucial role in protecting Levoca from invasions during medieval times and provide a physical reminder of the town's strategic importance. Today, these fortifications are a symbol of the city's resilience and serve as a powerful backdrop for the historic city center. Moreover, Levoca is not only significant for its historical and architectural heritage; it also played a vital role in the development of culture in the region. The town was a center of craftsmanship and artistic production, with carvers, painters, goldsmiths, and other artisans contributing to its creative dynamism. Levoca's designation as a National Cultural Heritage site and its inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List attest to this rich legacy, helping to ensure that the town's vibrant history is recognized and safeguarded for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former and the .  - Etymology. The city's name was historically written as  or  (both read as \\"Nagoya\\"). One possible origin is the adjective , meaning 'peaceful'.   - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market.  - Yokohama Pidgin Japanese , Yokohamese or Japanese Ports Lingo was a Japanese - based pidgin spoken in the Yokohama area during the late 19th century for communication between Japanese and foreigners . Most information on Yokohama Pidgin comes from Exercises in the Yokohama Dialect , a humorous pamphlet published in 1879 by Hoffman Atkinson .  - Historically a merchant city, Osaka has also been known as the and served as a center for the rice trade during the Edo period.  - The earliest written records regarding the region come from the \\"Nihon Shoki\\", which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa Period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from , an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine. Kobe became one of Japan's 17 designated cities in 1956.  - Yokohama's population of 3.7 million makes it Japan's largest city after the Special Wards of Tokyo. Yokohama developed rapidly as Japan's prominent port city following the end of Japan's relative isolation in the mid-19th century, and is today one of its major ports along with Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, Hakata, Tokyo, and Chiba.  - A pidgin , or pidgin language, is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common: typically, a mixture of simplified languages or a simplified primary language with other languages' elements included. It is most commonly employed in situations such as trade, or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the groups). Fundamentally, a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, as it is constructed impromptu, or by convention, between individuals or groups of people. A pidgin is not the native language of any speech community, but is instead learned as a second language. A pidgin may be built from words, sounds, or body language from multiple other languages and cultures. They allow people who have no common language to communicate with each other.

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: Mike is a high school student who loves science and as a hobby studies various chemistry, biology and physics experiments. Currently, Mike has a container in his garage that is filled with two different gases. A large portion of the gas is Mologen and a smaller portion is the gas Hamogen.  But I can use this background: Gas pressure results from collisions between gas particles and the inside walls of their container. If more gas is added to a rigid container, the gas pressure increases. The identities of the two gases do not matter. John Dalton, the English chemist who proposed the atomic theory, also studied mixtures of gases. He found that each gas in a mixture exerts a pressure independently of every other gas in the mixture. For example, our atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with smaller amounts of several other gases making up the rest. Since nitrogen makes up 78% of the gas particles in a given sample of air, it exerts 78% of the pressure. If the overall atmospheric pressure is 1.00 atm, then the pressure of just the nitrogen in the air is 0.78 atm. The pressure of the oxygen in the air is 0.21 atm.  What is an answer for this question: Which gas is responsible for more of the pressure inside the container?

After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ...

The end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors, including the weakening power of the Catholic Church, the Protestant Reformation and the banning of religious plays in many countries. Elizabeth I forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the Netherlands in 1539, the Papal States in 1547 and in Paris in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : Alright based on this title, it seems obvious that I’m a girl, but I’m actual a guy. Anyways, December of 2017, I went to India with my family, cuz my parents are immigrants and my maternal cousins stil live in India.  For this first few days, one of my favorite cousin was in a different city because her mom was getting an operation for a tumor. She came back later, and me and my older male cousin walkled to her houes to pick her up. (It’s about a 5 minute walk). On the way back one of her friends noticed her and wanted my cousin to hang out. She went in for a few minutes, and apparently her friend thought I was hot. That’s the first time that ever happened, and I know that there is no way in hell someone in the US of A would say that to me. NGL the girl’s in India have a low expectation. Anyway I get home, and there is a follow request from her on Instagram, and this is supper bizzare cuz I don’t even know who she is. My cousin said under no cicumstances to let her follow me, but I decided to humor her. I had some fun just screwing around with her, purely teasing but that’s a whole different fiasco. Moving one, some of the poeple in India have the funnist usernames (This will be important later) . There pretty far behind on fads that have happened in America. For example, fidget spinners were just introduceted therer last year. Some of the names are super edgy because of this but I’m not gonna expose anyone here.  Its been over a year, and recently her friend wished me happy birthday, which was odd because I hardly talk to her. I go to her account, and her follow ratio is fucking crazy. She has about 300 dudes following her and only follows one tik tok star from India, who recently passed away. I go full stalker mode and go through her follower list, and I find one of the funniest names of all time. The kid lives in India, and my cousin knows him, so I sent him a follow request and he accpeted about a day later. Oh. My. Lord. He’ s completely fresh of the boat, and would probably get bullied to hell in some of the public schools in America. HIs account is a gold-mine of what we would call cringe. I show him off to some off my family friends as my own personal jewl, and recently my best friend and I have had a competition to see who can get the most affection and the best response from him. My friends is currently in the lead. He kinds scared him by saying he wants to commit suicide and needed help. By far the best response. Anyways, now ALL my friends know who he is and I have begged them to add him to our group chat, but they refuse. We keep commenting on his pictures just saying stuff like I want to kiss you, I love you, you are beautiful, just the usual joking stuff.  Now to my surprise, my best friend made a geroup chat including him and it’s the greatest thing that has happened since Manchester City won the league last year. We’ve been kind of leading him on, pretending we are his friends, and he’s cool about it, but here’s the kicker.  One of my friends is an absolute dick to him. He despises him, because he commented on all his old posts. He did that to my friend to, whos been posting since 2014, and we got a kick out of it. BUT this other dude is being a complete prick. He’s told him to fuck off cuz he’s been having a wank and has been trying to intimidate him. NOW by Indian buddy started following a joke jock at our school. THe jock thinks he’s some sort of musical genius because he uploads rap songs to his soundcloud, and when my friend follow him, he did the exact thing you aren’t supposed to do. He commented on all of his old pictures including the one about him breaking up with his ex. And this dude is pretty pissed. I haven’t heard from my friedn for a while cuz I’ve been busy with school and stuff. But I’m genuinly kinda scared of what happens to him, because for the record the girls in India are a hell of a lot different and nicer than the one who reside in this beautiful country.  So am I the asshole, for potentially making him feel bad because some of the people that I have introduced to him have been super hostile towards him?

He travels by boat with several handfarms (Shihô Harumi, Magy, Shin'ichi Tokuhara and Takao Handa). The boat hits something, but it's not a rock - it's the dead body of a woman (Miyuki Konno). The boatman (Hiroshi Kuze) says that the body weighs a ton, so he deduces she was pregnant. When he turns her over, we can see that she was heavily pregnant. Finally landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada). She claims no knowledge of Komomo (Michié), but Christopher has to spend the night, requesting the company of a girl (Youki Kudoh) lurking back in the shadows, who joins him in his room.Disfigured and disturbed, the girl claims a closer connection with the dead than the living.

Given the question: Process: - He air we breathe contains oxygen and other gases - Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body - At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide - Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where it is removed from the blood stream and then exhaled - Your lungs and respiratory system automatically perform this vital process, called gas exchange -   Question: suppose the lung is not able to exhale or inhale happens, how will it affect the lung is defective.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, let's first briefly recap the stages of gas exchange mentioned in the prompt: 1. Air containing oxygen and other gases is inhaled and enters the lungs. 2. Oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried throughout the body. 3. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide, a waste gas, at each body cell. 4. Carbon dioxide is transported back to the lungs via the bloodstream. 5. Carbon dioxide is removed from the bloodstream and exhaled. Now, let's consider the hypothetical scenario where the lung is defective and cannot inhale or exhale properly. We will then determine how this perturbation would affect the second effect mentioned (oxygen being moved into the bloodstream and carried throughout the body). If the lung is defective and cannot inhale or exhale effectively, there will be: 1. Reduced oxygen intake: Inability to inhale properly would result in less oxygen being available in the lungs to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Consequently, less oxygen would be transported throughout the body, impairing various essential physiological processes. 2. Accumulation of carbon dioxide: Inability to exhale effectively would hinder the efficient removal of carbon dioxide from the body. Consequently, carbon dioxide would accumulate in the lungs and bloodstream, leading to respiratory acidosis and other potential health issues. Given these consequences, the perturbation of the lung's inability to inhale or exhale would have a significant impact on the second effect mentioned – oxygen being moved into the bloodstream and carried throughout the body. Specifically, there would be less oxygen available for transportation, thus negatively affecting overall bodily function. The answer is: less effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That job? Chick-fil-A franchisee. As emails recently released under a Freedom of Information Act request reveal, Pruitt had his executive scheduler email the fast food company's chairman and president in May 2017 to ask if he'd be willing to meet with Pruitt and discuss \\"a potential business opportunity.\\" Eventually, Pruitt talked to a rep from Chick-fil-A's legal department and explained that what he had in mind was his wife becoming a franchisee, a Chick-fil-A rep confirms to the Post. That never ended up happening, though Marlyn Pruitt did begin the franchisee application. The FOIA request also reveals Scott Pruitt got in touch with the CEO of New York nonprofit Concordia and asked him to call his wife; the group ended up paying Marlyn Pruitt 2,000 and travel expenses for help organizing a conference at which Scott Pruitt spoke, though the CEO says the couple never \\"solicited a position for Mrs. Pruitt.\\" Current and former EPA aides say Pruitt mentioned his eagerness for his wife to make money and his frustration with the increased cost of having two homes, one in Oklahoma and one in DC. It is a violation of federal ethics laws for a public official to use his position or staff for private gain or to have a staffer handle personal tasks, and a former head of the Office of Government Ethics says Pruitt's behavior on his wife's behalf could be a misuse of public office. Also Tuesday, the Government Accountability Office said it would investigate whether a tweet sent from the official EPA account constituted \\"partisan taunting,\\" the AP reports. Article:","output":"The Saga of Scott Pruitt's Involvement with Chick-fil-A and Potential Misuse of Public Office In the latest strange twist to Scott Pruitt's tenure as head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), it has been revealed that he attempted to exploit his official position and employees of the EPA to secure his wife a job as a franchisee of popular fast food chain Chick-fil-A. Emails released under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request have brought Pruitt's actions to light, raising additional questions about the ethics of the EPA chief. The FOIA-requested emails show that Pruitt's executive scheduler contacted Chick-fil-A's chairman and president, Dan Cathy, in May 2017, requesting a meeting to discuss \\"a potential business opportunity.\\" Subsequently, Pruitt spoke with a representative from Chick-fil-A's legal department, explaining that he envisioned his wife, Marlyn Pruitt, becoming a franchisee. While Marlyn Pruitt initiated the franchisee application, the bid to become a Chick-fil-A franchisee was ultimately unsuccessful. The FOIA request also highlighted Pruitt's attempts to secure other employment for his wife, including reaching out to the CEO of New York nonprofit organization Concordia. Marlyn Pruitt eventually received 2,000 and travel expenses for her work in assisting with the organization of a conference where Scott Pruitt was a speaker. Concordia's CEO has clarified that the couple did not \\"solicit a position\\" for Marlyn Pruitt during the process. Both current and former EPA aides have noted Pruitt's desire for his wife to earn money, expressing his frustration with the financial demands of maintaining homes in both Oklahoma and Washington, DC.  These revelations surrounding Pruitt's efforts to assist his wife in securing work have raised serious ethical concerns. Federal ethics laws dictate that public officials are forbidden from using their position or staff for personal gain or from requiring staff members to handle personal tasks. The former head of the Office of Government Ethics has stated that Pruitt's actions pertaining to his wife's employment could be considered a misuse of public office. In addition to these ethical concerns, the Government Accountability Office announced on Tuesday that it would investigate whether a tweet sent from the official EPA account constituted \\"partisan taunting.\\" As Pruitt continues to face scrutiny for his conduct in his position as EPA head, further investigations will explore the potential misuse of public office and broader ethical issues within the organization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Here is a premise: \\"Man skateboarding\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The man is skateboarding in the shower.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"The premise \\"Man skateboarding\\" does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the hypothesis \\"The man is skateboarding in the shower.\\" is true. The premise only states that a man is skateboarding but does not specify the location or context in which the skateboarding is taking place. In order to confirm or refute the hypothesis, we would need additional information and context about the man's actions and surroundings. The hypothesis describes a specific scenario where the man is skateboarding within the confines of a shower. This is a rather unusual and unlikely scenario due to the limited space, likely presence of water, and potentially slippery surface of a shower. Skateboarding typically takes place in more spacious and suitable environments such as streets, parks, or specifically designed skateboarding areas. However, without any further context or details, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis based on the premise provided. One would need more information about the man's location, the presence of a shower, the conditions under which he is skateboarding, and any potential reasons for such an unusual choice of a place to skateboard.  In conclusion, the premise \\"Man skateboarding\\" does not provide enough information to determine the truthfulness of the hypothesis \\"The man is skateboarding in the shower.\\" The hypothesis describes a unique and particular situation that, although improbable, cannot be confirmed or rejected based solely on the given premise.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Every pet owner loves his pet. There is no argument here. But when we asked our readers whether they would clone (, )their beloved animals, the responses  were split almost down the middle. Of the 228 readers who answered it, 108 would clone, 111 would not and nine weighed each side without offering an opinion. Clearly, from readers' response, this is an issue that reaches deeply into both the joy and _ . It speaks, as well, to people's widely differing expectations over the developing scientific procedure. Most of the respondents who favored the idea strongly believed it would produce at least a close copy of the original; many felt the process would actually return an exact copy. Those on the other side, however, held little hope a clone could never truly recreate a pet, many simply didn't wish to go against the natural law of life and death. Both sides expressed equal love for their animals. More than a few respondents owned \\"the best dog/cat in the world\\". They thought of their pets as their \\"best friend\\", \\"a member of the family,\\"\\"the light of my life.\\" They told moving stories of pets' heroism, intelligence and selfless devotion. Then the loss is so disturbing---and the cloning so attractive. \\"People become very close to their animals, and the loss can be just as hard to bear as when a friend or family member dies,\\" says Gary Kowalski, author of Goodbye, Friend: Healing Wisdom for Anyone Who Has Ever Lost a Pet. \\"For me, cloning feels like an attempt to turn death away...It's understandable.

Answer a question about this article: New domestic housing in many parts of the world today is commonly made from timber-framed construction. Engineered wood products are becoming a bigger part of the construction industry. They may be used in both residential and commercial buildings as structural and aesthetic materials. What industry benefits greatly from engineered wood products?","output":"The construction industry benefits greatly from engineered wood products. These products have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their numerous advantages over traditional building materials. Engineered wood products are used in both residential and commercial construction for structural and aesthetic purposes. The increased adoption of these products has led to several advantages for the construction industry as a whole, which can be outlined as follows: 1. Cost-effectiveness: Engineered wood products are often more cost-effective than traditional building materials such as concrete and steel. This is because they require less raw material, labor, and energy for production. In addition, the lighter weight of these products can lead to cost savings in transportation and handling. 2. Sustainability: Engineered wood products are made from renewable resources, primarily small trees and wood waste from the timber industry. The use of these products promotes sustainable forest management practices and reduces the carbon footprint of the building industry. Moreover, manufacturing processes of engineered wood products generally produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions when compared to the production of concrete and steel. 3. Design flexibility: Engineered wood products offer a high degree of design flexibility, as they can be easily customized to suit a wide variety of construction and architectural needs. This versatility allows for innovative designs and creative solutions to be employed in both residential and commercial construction projects. 4. Strength and durability: Despite their lighter weight, engineered wood products are often stronger than traditional materials due to their engineered nature. They are designed and manufactured to have specific strength properties, which can lead to increased durability and a longer lifespan for buildings. 5. Energy efficiency: Engineered wood products provide excellent insulation properties and contribute to better energy efficiency in buildings, reducing energy consumption and related costs. The performance of these products can be further enhanced with the addition of insulation materials. 6. Speed of construction: The prefabricated nature of engineered wood products allows for faster and more efficient construction compared to traditional building methods. This translates to shorter project timelines and lower labor costs, which can save time and money for developers, contractors, and homeowners. 7. Aesthetics: The natural beauty of wood can enhance the visual appeal of both residential and commercial buildings. Engineered wood products offer a range of options for incorporating wood aesthetics into construction projects, from structural elements such as beams and columns to decorative features like cladding and interior finishes. In summary, the construction industry benefits greatly from the use of engineered wood products by offering cost-effective, versatile, sustainable, strong, durable, and energy-efficient building materials. All these factors contribute to enhancing the overall performance and quality of construction projects while promoting a more environmentally responsible approach to building and urban development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: John William Money (8 July 1921 - 7 July 2006) was a psychologist, sexologist and author, specializing in research into sexual identity and biology of gender. He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of \\"gender\\" affect an individual. More recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regards to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer and his eventual suicide. Money's writing has been translated into many languages, and includes around 2,000 articles, books, chapters and reviews. Context: Born in Morrinsville, New Zealand, to a family of English and Welsh descent, Money initially studied psychology at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating with a double master's degree in psychology and education in 1944. Money was a junior member of the psychology faculty at the University of Otago in Dunedin, but in 1947, at the age of 26, he emigrated to the United States to study at the Psychiatric Institute of the University of Pittsburgh. He left Pittsburgh and earned his PhD from Harvard University in 1952. He was married briefly in the 1950s but had no children.  Money proposed and developed several theories and related terminology, including gender identity, gender role, gender-identity/role, and lovemap. He coined the term paraphilia (appearing in the DSM-III) to replace perversions and introduced the term sexual orientation in place of sexual preference, arguing that attraction is not necessarily a matter of free choice. Money was a professor of pediatrics and medical psychology at Johns Hopkins University from 1951 until his death. He also established the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic in 1965 along with Claude Migeon who was the head of plastic surgery at Johns Hopkins. The hospital began performing sexual reassignment surgery in 1966. At Johns Hopkins, Money was also involved with the Sexual Behaviors Unit, which ran studies on sex-reassignment surgery. He received the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal in 2002 from the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research.  Money was an early supporter of New Zealand's arts, both literary and visual. He was a noted friend and supporter of author Janet Frame. In 2002, as his Parkinson's disease worsened, Money donated a substantial portion of his art collection to the Eastern Southland Art Gallery in Gore, New Zealand. In 2003, the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, opened the John Money wing at the Eastern Southland Gallery.  Money died 7 July 2006, one day before his 85th birthday, in Towson, Maryland, of complications from Parkinson's disease. Question: what happened in his childhood?

Although František now agreed that his son should follow a musical career, he could not provide financial support. In August 1843 Smetana departed for Prague with twenty gulden, and no immediate prospects. Lacking any formal musical training, he needed a teacher, and was introduced by Kateřina Kolářová's mother to Josef Proksch, head of the Prague Music Institute—where Kateřina was now studying. Proksch used the most modern teaching methods, drawing on Beethoven, Chopin, Berlioz and the Leipzig circle of Liszt. In January 1844 Proksch agreed to take Smetana as a pupil, and at the same time the young musician's financial difficulties were eased when he secured an appointment as music teacher to the family of a nobleman, Count Thun.For the next three years, besides teaching piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work—they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile, his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then set out on a tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist.  Guess a valid title for it!

The central idea is that any individual's sense of identity is determined in large part by the explorations and commitments that he or she makes regarding certain personal and social traits. It follows that the core of the research in this paradigm investigates the degrees to which a person has made certain explorations, and the degree to which he or she displays a commitment to those explorations. Unanswerable Question (using suggestion iii): In which year did Erik Erikson win the Nobel Prize for his work on the Neo-Eriksonian identity status paradigm? Explanation: The unanswerable question was created by introducing a new entity, \\"Nobel Prize,\\" which is not mentioned in the passage. Additionally, it falsely implies that Erik Erikson is directly related to the Neo-Eriksonian identity status paradigm and that he won the Nobel Prize for the work. This question is unanswerable because it does not correspond to the information provided in the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Chad Varah, a British Anglican priest who lived from 1911 to 2007 is probably best remembered for being the founder of which charity organisation in 1953 ????","output":"Chad Varah, a British Anglican priest who lived from 1911 to 2007, is best remembered for being the founder of the Samaritans, a renowned charity organization, in 1953. The Samaritans, originally named \\"The Samaritan Movement\\" or \\"The 999 Club,\\" has since grown to become an influential and vital institution, providing emotional support to individuals in distress and contemplating suicide. Born in Lincolnshire, England, Chad Varah had a lifelong concern regarding the welfare of people on the verge of mental breakdowns and those feeling isolated or overwhelmed by personal issues. When Varah was 14, he conducted the funeral of a teenage girl who had committed suicide, an incident that would later inspire him to establish the Samaritans. In 1953, while serving as a vicar at St. Stephen Walbrook Church in London, Varah launched the Samaritans after reading a newspaper article about suicide. The article discussed multiple cases of people dying by suicide, which deeply troubled Varah, and he resolved to create a safe space for these vulnerable individuals. He aimed to offer a listening ear and non-judgmental, confidential support. Initially, Chad Varah himself was the primary listener, providing emotional support to those who called or visited his vicarage. Realizing that the demand was beyond the capacity of one person, he recruited and trained several volunteers to help with the cause. The Samaritans adopted the philosophy of 'befriending, listening, and understanding,' helping those in need to explore their feelings and navigate through their emotional turmoil without passing judgment. Seeing the immense impact of the organization in the United Kingdom, Varah's work inspired similar suicide prevention helplines and organizations around the world. Today, the Samaritans has over 200 branches in Britain and Ireland, with more than 20,000 active volunteers. Moreover, the Samaritans' helpline (116 123 in the UK and Ireland) operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, continuing to offer free, confidential emotional support for those facing a crisis or feeling overwhelmed by their emotions. In addition to the support offered by the helpline, Samaritans also provide outreach to various community settings such as schools, homeless shelters, and prisons. The organization engages in research activities and collaborates with other mental health agencies to improve suicide prevention strategies and policies. Overall, Chad Varah, a British Anglican priest, has left an indelible mark in the field of mental health and suicide prevention through founding the Samaritans in 1953. His work has saved countless lives, provided a light in the darkness for those struggling with their emotions, and made vital strides toward destigmatizing mental health and suicide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence: The gardener is a man.","output":"Based on the provided text, it is impossible to definitively conclude that the gardener is a man. The text does mention the presence of a gardener, as it states, \\"they got a cabbage-leaf full of raspberries from the gardener\\"; however, it does not specify the gardener's gender. In modern times, both men and women can hold positions as gardeners, making it impossible to assume the gardener's gender solely based on their occupation. Furthermore, the text focuses on the actions of Father, Mother, and Miss Blake, who play a more central role in this narrative. These individuals are mentioned doing various activities, such as paying calls, riding a bicycle, and leaving the premises. However, details about the gardener are limited, with only a brief mention of their contribution in providing the raspberries. Consequently, as there is no explicit information about the gardener's gender in the provided text, it would be inaccurate and presumptuous to assume their gender. Thus, the sentence \\"The gardener is a man\\" is not necessarily true based on the available information. To arrive at a definitive conclusion about the gardener's gender, one would need additional details, either from the surrounding context or by seeking clarification from the author. Without such information, the gardener's gender remains unspecified and open to interpretation, making it impossible to confirm the sentence's accuracy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Reduction in flow caused by dams, diversions, water for thermoelectric power stations, and evaporation losses from reservoirs -- the latter of which consumes more than 15 percent of the river's natural runoff -- has had severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf. Today's desiccated delta, at only a fraction of its former size, no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish, shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline. Since 1963, the only times when the Colorado River has reached the ocean have been during El Niño events in the 1980s and 1990s. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that does the colorado river still reach the ocean? Pick your answer from: +no. +yes. The answer is:","output":"+no. The Colorado River no longer reaches the ocean regularly. This is because the water flow has been reduced by things like dams and evaporation from reservoirs. This has had a big impact on the environment and the animals that live there. The river only reached the ocean during some special events called El Niño in the 1980s and 1990s.

He is the creator of the Nickelodeon television series SpongeBob SquarePants (1999-present) which he has also directed, produced, and written. It has gone on to become one of the longest-running American television series as well as the highest-rated show ever to air on Nickelodeon. Born in Lawton, Oklahoma and raised in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean as a child and also developed an interest in art. Hillenburg's wife, Karen, is a chef who teaches at the New School of Cooking in Culver City, California. Hillenburg deems her to be the funniest person that he knows. The couple have a son named Clay (born c. 1998). Hillenburg formerly resided in Hollywood and in Pasadena, and now lives with his family in San Marino, California. His hobbies include surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, and performing \\"noisy rock music\\" on his guitar. He would jam with his son who is a drummer which, according to Hillenburg, is \\"a great way to bond with each other.\\" He also enjoys birdwatching at home, but says that he was always \\"an ocean freak\\".

Pakistan is like a kid who wants a toy that helps it play in its backyard. For Pakistan, the Russian Mil Mi-35 attack helicopter is like a really good toy that lets them play their games pretty well, like protecting their home or joining in on team games. It's also less expensive, so they can buy more toys without using all their allowance. The Kamov Ka-52 might be a fancier toy with more shiny features, but it's also more expensive, and sometimes it's not as easy to play with. So, Pakistan decided that the Mil Mi-35 is a good fit for them. 2. India is like a different kid who is playing in a different backyard. They needed a toy that fits their games too.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: WASHINGTON — Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions. The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

Prior to 2006, the game was known as the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship. The FCS is the highest division in college football to hold a playoff tournament sanctioned by the NCAA to determine its champion. The four-team playoff system used by the Bowl Subdivision is not sanctioned by the NCAA.  - The Eddie Robinson Award is awarded annually to college football's top head coach in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA). The award was established by The Sports Network, since merged into STATS LLC, in 1987 and is voted upon by the division's sports information directors and selected sports writers.

D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers, with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities, and more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition.  - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - A touchdown is a means of scoring in both American and Canadian football.

The first of the universities to be founded was Central Connecticut State University, established in 1849 as a normal school for teacher education. Over time the other three institutions were founded as normal schools and in 1959 they were converted into state colleges to reflect their expanded mission. From their founding until 1965, they were overseen by the Connecticut State Department of Education. In 1965 the General Assembly transferred control of the then-colleges to an independent Board of Trustees. In 1983 the four institutions were converted into universities, together constituting the Connecticut State University System.  - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC).

Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.  - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.  - The College Football Hall of Fame is a hall of fame and museum devoted to college football.

The Steelers traveled to London, England and were considered the visitor team against a Matt Cassel-led Vikings team.  The Vikes got off to a fast start as Blair Walsh nailed a 54-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead followed up by Matt Cassel hooking up with Greg Jennings on a 70-yard touchdown pass for a 10-0 lead.  The Steelers managed to get on the board later on in the first quarter when rookie RB Le'Von Bell ran for an 8-yard touchdown to make the game 10-7.  The Vikes moved ahead by double digits in the second quarter as Adrian Peterson ran for a 60-yard touchdown for a 17-7 lead.  Shaun Suisham got the Steelers within a touchdown by nailing a 26-yard field goal for a 17-10 lead.  Walsh moved the Vikes ahead by 10 at halftime by kicking a 37-yard field goal for a 20-10 lead.  The Steelers came within 3 as Le'Von Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown shortening the lead to 20-17 but the Vikes managed to move ahead 27-17 after Peterson ran for a 7-yard touchdown and then Cassel found Jennings again on a 16-yard touchdown pass to make the lead 34-17.  In the 4th quarter, Jerricho Cotchery hooked up with Ben Roethlisberger on a 15-yard touchdown pass for a 34-24 lead, and then tried to rally as Suisham nailed a 28-yard field goal.  The Steelers' comeback attempt was ruined again as Roethlisberger was sacked and fumbled the ball with less than a minute left in the game sealing the victory for the Vikes. With this loss, the Steelers are off to their worst start since the AFL-NFL merger. They had last started 0-4 in 1968, when they started 0-6.  This is also the first time since 2006 in which the team would fall to 4 games below .500 when they started that season 2-6. Who threw the longest touchdown pass of the game?","output":"To find the longest touchdown pass of the game, I will review the given text and identify any mentions of touchdown passes and their respective distances. 1. The text mentions that Matt Cassel threw a 70-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings. 2. Later, it states that Cassel found Jennings again on a 16-yard touchdown pass. 3. Ben Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery. Comparing these three touchdown passes, I can conclude that the longest touchdown pass of the game was thrown by Matt Cassel, who connected with Greg Jennings for a 70-yard touchdown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who displayed an abstract \\"Mother and Child' in the front garden of his house? from the following article ?  In 1932, after six year's teaching at the Royal College, Moore took up a post as the Head of the Department of Sculpture at the Chelsea School of Art. Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist. The answer to this question is:","output":"The answer to this question is: Penrose. In the article, it states that \\"In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead.\\" So, Roland Penrose is the person who displayed the abstract \\"Mother and Child\\" in the front garden of his house."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A German-language folk band have been asked to return 13 awards after it emerged that they have been 'faking' the music on their albums. The seven-man Kastelruther Spatzen used studio musicians to create their famous Alpine brass-band sound, their former producer claims. The revelations have made the headlines in Germany echoing the scandal surrounding early 90s lip-syncing pop-sensation Milli Vanilli. 'Fake': Folk music favourites Kastelruther Spatzen are being accused of 'faking music' after it emerged they use studio musicians. Kastelruther Spatzen, from the German-speaking. province of South Tyrol in northern Italy, were defended by their. manager who said using studio musicians were 'common practice'. 'The success of this band is based on a. giant fraud,' former producer Walter Widemair told Bild newspaper. He said that only the lead singer's voice was genuine on the albums and called for the group to return their prices. 'The band of fakes must give back their Echo awards,' he said. Kastelruther Spatzen's manager Helmut Brossmann said that  it was common practice for folk music bands to use studio musicians for their albums. In his defence of the popular folk-music band, he said Kastelruther Spatzen had even listed the studio musicians on their albums. Retro fake: Late 80s German pop duo Milli Vanilli were discovered to have been lip-syncing to others vocals and were forced to return their 1990 Grammy Award. Real thing: Their former producer said lead singer Norbert Rier, seen here accepting a Folk Music award in Germany earlier this year, was the only 'genuine' voice on the albums. In a statement on the band's website Mr. Brossmann said Widemair had been responsible for the studio recordings. for nearly 30 years and was now betraying the band for commercial. reasons - to help promote his own book. 'The names of the studio musician and everyone who contributed to the chorus of songs was mentioned in every CD that they were involved in,' said Brossmann. 'In nearly 30 years of concert tours, they always played and sang everything live.' Praised: Kastelruther Spatzen after winning Best Folk Music at the Echo Awards in 2007, an award which may now be taken from them. The dispute has received much media attention in Germany, with newspapers recalling the scandal of their fellow countrymen in pop duo Milli Vanilli. German producer Frank Farian turned two young Munich models, Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, into the group known as Milli Vanilli. The group had great international success in the late 80s and early 90s with songs such as 'Girl You Know It's True' and 'Blame It On The Rain', but were disgraced when it emerged that they had been miming to other people's vocals. They were stripped of their 1990 Grammy Award and their management faced over 20 lawsuits. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A German folk band called Kastelruther Spatzen has been asked to return 13 awards because they were caught \\"faking\\" their music on albums.

In the Paleozoic Era the Pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate; it broke into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era and the Tethys sea developed between Laurasia and Gondwana during the Jurassic Period. The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the Alpide belt, from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia—a process that began at the end of the Mesozoic and continues into the present. The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process, caused by the collision between the African and the Eurasian plates that began in the late Cretaceous Period. Question: The Tethys sea developed during what period of time?","output":"The Tethys Sea developed during the Jurassic Period, which is a geologic time period that occurred between approximately 201.3 million years ago and 145 million years ago. This period is characterized by the predominance of dinosaurs on Earth and it falls within the Mesozoic Era, the time frame that lies between the Paleozoic Era and the Cenozoic Era. During the Jurassic Period, the Pangaean supercontinent, which had formed during the Paleozoic Era as a single tectonic plate, started to break apart into separate plates. As these plates drifted apart, the Tethys Sea began to develop, creating a vast expanse of water between the Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south. Laurasia and Gondwana would later split to form the continents we recognize today. The Tethys Sea played a crucial role in the process of the Alpine orogeny, the formation of mountain ranges. As the Earth's tectonic plates continued to move, the Tethys Sea was eventually squeezed between the colliding plates, giving rise to a series of mountain ranges collectively known as the Alpide belt. This belt stretches from Gibraltar in the west to the Himalayas in the east and further to Indonesia in the southeast. The formation of the Alps was a part of this mountain-building process, resulting from the collision between the African and Eurasian plates, which began in the Late Cretaceous Period, around 100 to 66 million years ago. This process has been ongoing for millions of years and continues to shape the Earth's landscape even today. In summary, the Tethys Sea developed during the Jurassic Period, between 201.3 and 145 million years ago, as the Pangaean supercontinent began to break apart into separate plates. The subsequent tectonic activity and plate collisions led to the formation of the Alpide belt, including the Alps, which continue to evolve through geological processes to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person whose influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial?

Gareth Bale's first season at Real Madrid: an appraisal Six weeks ago Gareth Bale turned up for a Wales friendly – no mean feat for a man of his ability – and scored a goal that only he could score. He picked up the ball in his own half and went haring down the wing. Bale was in the right-back position but, aware of the threat he poses from anywhere on a football field, the Iceland defender barged him off the pitch and towards the advertising hoardings. Undeterred, Bale took an outside line and kept sprinting, gathering pace as he galloped down the sidelines. He had only one thought: to attack the goal. He approached another defender, shimmied on to his left foot, and swept the ball past the keeper. He did it again last night. Only this time he was not playing in front of 13,000 Wales fans at the Cardiff City Stadium. He was playing for Real Madrid, in front of King Juan Carlos of Spain and the Barcelona defence, and his sprint up the touchline took him closer to the 55,000 fans who had packed into the Mestalla to watch the Copa del Rey final. The Madrid press, who had demanded a big game from Bale in the absence of the injured Cristiano Ronaldo, were duty satisfied. \\"Do not be surprised if you dream about centaurs,\\" warned Juanma Trueba in AS last night. \\"Bale was Bolt\\", read the headline on El Pais, with José Sámano's reporting that \\"lightning\\" had decided the Cup final: \\"Usain Bolt appeared with Welsh legs and put Real Madrid on the throne.\\" The story of Bale's season cannot be reduced to one match. He has provided 20 goals and 15 assists, could still complete the treble, and has not lost his love of the spectacular finish: But has he done enough? He has outshone the other expensive import to La Liga this season, Neymar, who looked like a jumped-up youth-team player in the Copa del Rey final. But he has not impacted games like Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, who have scored 82 goals between them this season. Was €100m a fair price for Bale, or should Bale be doing even more for Real Madrid? Has Bale been a success and was he worth the €100m transfer fee? What was this article about?","output":"This article provides an appraisal of Gareth Bale's first season at Real Madrid after his record-breaking transfer from Tottenham Hotspur for €100 million. It starts by highlighting his exceptional performances for Wales and draws a comparison to his impact for Real Madrid. The article emphasizes his iconic moment in the Copa del Rey final, where he scored a breathtaking solo goal, as a testament to his ability and the value he brings to the team. The piece discusses the stats of Bale's season, which includes 20 goals and 15 assists, and his potential to complete a treble with Real Madrid. It compares his performances to Neymar, another expensive import to La Liga, asserting that Bale has outshined the Brazilian. However, Bale's impact is still considered to be less than that of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi who have scored a combined total of 82 goals in that same season. The central question raised in the article is whether Gareth Bale has been a success at Real Madrid and whether his €100 million transfer fee was justified. While acknowledging his contribution to the team and his undeniable talent, the piece implies that to match the high expectations that come with such a hefty price tag, Bale should be delivering even more exceptional performances like those of Ronaldo and Messi."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who did a Palestinian general think was clearly killed by Israelis? is inside the article: Key issues include how much footage was shot; that it was blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit; that France 2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves; and that the cameraman stopped filming at that point. Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c. 17 minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film of the death of the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up. Several commentators questioned what time the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad arrived at the hospital; why there seemed to be little blood on the ground where they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting. One physician maintained that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.There was no criminal inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists to photograph the scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.A pathologist examined the boy's body, but there was no full autopsy. It is unclear whether bullets were recovered from the scene or from Jamal and Muhammad.

He needed to find appropriate wavelength electromagnetic radiations for his experiments. To that end, he selected three electromagnetic radiations, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. He noted microwaves as case A, infrared as case B, and visible light as case C.  But I can use this background: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by \\"feel.\\" Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called \\"pits\\". Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 53% is infrared radiation, 44% is visible light, and 3% is ultraviolet radiation.  What is an answer for this question: Which wavelengths would be longer, case A or case B?

Infrared wavelengths are longer than visible light but shorter than microwaves.  Now, to answer the question concerning which wavelengths are longer between Cases A and B, we can recall the information about their positions within the electromagnetic spectrum. Since Case A represents microwaves and Case B represents infrared light, we know that the wavelengths of microwaves are longer than those of infrared light. Therefore, the wavelengths in Case A (microwaves) would be longer than those in Case B (infrared light)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read this and answer the question The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the Members of Parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: \\"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\\" If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites \\"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Georgette Heyer (; 16 August 1902 - 4 July 1974) was an English historical romance and detective fiction novelist. Her writing career began in 1921, when she turned a story for her younger brother into the novel The Black Moth. While holidaying with her family in December 1920, Heyer met George Ronald Rougier, who was two years her senior. The two became regular dance partners while Rougier studied at the Royal School of Mines to become a mining engineer. In the spring of 1925, shortly after the publication of her fifth novel, they became engaged. One month later, Heyer's father died of a heart attack. He left no pension, and Heyer assumed financial responsibility for her brothers, aged 19 and 14. Two months after her father's death, on 18 August, Heyer and Rougier married in a simple ceremony.  In October 1925 Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, partly because he had learned Russian as a child. Heyer remained at home and continued to write. In 1926, she released These Old Shades, in which the Duke of Avon courts his own ward. Unlike her first novel, These Old Shades focused more on personal relationships than on adventure. The book appeared in the midst of the 1926 United Kingdom general strike; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising. Nevertheless, the book sold 190,000 copies. Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel's sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews. She once wrote to a friend that \\"as for being photographed at Work or in my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary. My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.\\"  Rougier returned home in the summer of 1926, but within months he was sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika. Heyer joined him there the following year. They lived in a hut made of elephant grass located in the bush; Heyer was the first white woman her servants had ever seen. While in Tanganyika, Heyer wrote The Masqueraders; set in 1745, the book follows the romantic adventures of siblings who pretend to be of the opposite sex in order to protect their family, all former Jacobites. Although Heyer did not have access to all of her reference material, the book contained only one anachronism: she placed the opening of White's a year too early. She also wrote an account of her adventures, titled \\"The Horned Beast of Africa\\", which was published in 1929 in the newspaper The Sphere.  In 1928, Heyer followed her husband to Macedonia, where she almost died after a dentist improperly administered an anaesthetic. She insisted they return to England before starting a family. The following year Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner. After a failed experiment running a gas, coke, and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier, while Heyer continued to provide the bulk of the family's earnings with her writing. What happened during their marriage?","output":"During Georgette Heyer's marriage to George Ronald Rougier, the couple experienced several significant events and challenges. After getting married in 1925, Rougier was sent to work in the Caucasus Mountains, while Heyer stayed at home to write. They spent some time apart, but when Rougier returned in 1926, the couple's reunion was short-lived as he was soon sent to the East African territory of Tanganyika, where Heyer joined him the following year. They lived in a hut made of elephant grass, and during this time, Heyer continued to write novels, including The Masqueraders. In 1928, the couple moved to Macedonia, but due to a life-threatening incident where Heyer almost died after improperly administered anesthesia, she insisted on returning to England before starting a family. In 1929, Rougier left his job, making Heyer the primary breadwinner of the family. To support the family, Rougier attempted to run a gas, coke, and lighting company, but later purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money borrowed from Heyer's aunts. Heyer's brother Boris lived above the shop and helped Rougier manage it, while Heyer continued her writing career, ensuring the financial well-being of her family. Throughout their marriage, they faced various challenges, such as work-related separations and financial struggles, but they persevered and managed to overcome these obstacles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your ability to get a loan will depend on your credit history, including your credit score, overall indebtedness, and your income. You should obtain a free copy of your credit report and review it for errors. Dispute anything that is inaccurate.  Get your free copy by calling 1-877-322-8228 or visiting http://www.annualcreditreport.com. You will need to provide your name, address, date of birth, and Social Security Number.  Common errors include accounts with the wrong balance or limit listed, or accounts inaccurately reported as delinquent or closed. If you default on your loan, your credit history will take a hit. Also, you will lose the collateral you pledged. Accordingly, calculate what you can afford for a loan payment each month.  You may need to create a budget to determine how much you can comfortably borrow. Calculate your fixed expenses, such as your rent or mortgage, and then see how much you can reduce other expenses, such as entertainment or travel expenses. Avoid borrowing too much. Because you will likely receive a lower interest rate on a secured loan, you might be tempted to borrow more than you need. Don't! Get the process started by contacting lenders and asking for a secured loan. Tell them the amount you want and what you are willing to pledge as collateral. Ask them about the application process and any timelines. Find out what collateral they accept. Lenders are not required to accept collateral, so you should check whether or not they will accept what you have to offer. If not, talk about what else you might be able to pledge. The lender will review your application and decide whether or not to extend a loan. The length of this process will depend on the lender. If you have questions, call the loan officer you have been working with. You need to comparison shop by looking at the terms offered by many different lenders. Remember, you have not taken out the loan until you sign for it. Compare the following:  APR. The annual percentage rate is the interest rate you will pay on the loan. It also might include other charges, such as credit charges. Typically, the lower the APR, the less expensive the loan. Length of the loan repayment. The longer you have to pay back the loan, the less you will pay each month. However, you will pay more in the end, because of accrued interest. Monthly payment amount. Prepayment penalties. Some lenders charge extra fees if you pay off a loan early. Try to find a lender who does not charge these penalties. Ask the lender if you can get copies of all the documents you need to sign. You will want sufficient time to review everything. Make sure you understand all conditions before signing.  If you do not understand what you are reading, then contact an attorney to help you. At closing, remember to review the documents to make sure nothing has changed since you were approved for the loan. In fact, you should ask this question of the loan officer.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of maintaining good credit history, obtaining a free credit report to catch errors, cautiously calculating loan affordability, seeking secured loans from various lenders, comparing loan terms, and comprehending all conditions before finalizing a loan agreement to make responsible borrowing decisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Treaty: After their adoption, treaties as well as their amendments have to follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations, as applied by the Office of Legal Affairs, including signature, ratification and entry into force. What are three official legal procedures of the United Nations that all treaties must follow after their adoption?","output":"The United Nations serves as a key platform for the establishment of international treaties, which are critical for fostering cooperation, diplomacy, and the observance of international law among Member States. After a treaty's adoption, there are three primary official legal procedures that must be followed, as managed by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs. These legal procedures ensure the proper functioning and implementation of the treaty among the participating countries. 1. Signature: The first official procedure is the signature of the treaty by the respective Member States. The signature marks an initial step in which parties express their intention to comply with the treaty's terms and conditions. Each state typically authorizes a specific representative, often their ambassador or respective foreign minister, to sign the treaty on behalf of their nation. A signing ceremony is usually organized during which the representatives from participating countries gather and sign the treaty. The act of signing indicates their country's political commitment to adhering to the treaty's principles and abiding by its provisions in good faith. However, signing does not necessarily make the treaty legally binding yet. 2. Ratification: After the signing ceremony, the ratification process takes place to establish the treaty as legally binding for each state party. Ratification is the act by which each nation's government gives its formal consent to be bound by the treaty, typically after having obtained the approval of its parliament or the appropriate legislative authority. The ratification demonstrates that the countries involved have the intention to uphold the treaty's provisions in both domestic and international law. Each nation follows its specific constitutional guidelines to ratify the treaty, which may involve the passage of domestic legislation or the approval by certain governmental bodies. Once completed, the ratification instruments are deposited with the United Nations Secretary-General or another designated depositary.  3. Entry into Force: The final legal procedure for a treaty is the entry into force, which is when the treaty officially becomes legally binding for the participating countries. The requirements for a treaty to enter into force are usually specified in the treaty text itself, often in the form of a specific number of ratifications or a specified date upon which the treaty's provisions become effective. Entry into force means that the treaty principles and obligations are now integrated into the international legal system and are binding on the state parties. From this point on, these states are expected to comply with and fulfill their duties under the treaty in accordance with international law. In summary, the three primary official legal procedures of the United Nations that all treaties must follow after their adoption are the signature, ratification, and entry into force. These procedures are essential in ensuring the legitimacy, legal binding nature, and effective implementation of a treaty among the Member States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This scheme allows the annotator to define each markable as a certain mention type (pronoun, NP, VP or clause). The mentions can be defined further in terms of their cohesive function (antecedent, anaphoric, cataphoric, comparative, substitution, ellipsis, apposition). Antecedents can either be marked as simple or split or as entity or event. The annotation scheme also includes pronoun type (personal, possessive, demonstrative, reflexive, relative) and modifier types of NPs (possessive, demonstrative, definite article, or none for proper names), see BIBREF46 for details. The mentions referring to the same discourse item are linked between each other. We use the annotation tool MMAX2 BIBREF48 which was also used for the annotation of ParCorFull. In the next step, chain members are annotated for their correctness. For the incorrect translations of mentions, we include the following error categories: gender, number, case, ambiguous and other. The latter category is open, which means that the annotators can add their own error types during the annotation process. With this, the final typology of errors also considered wrong named entity, wrong word, missing word, wrong syntactic structure, spelling error and addressee reference.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The Territory of Papua and New Guinea was established by an administrative union between the Australian-administered territories of Papua and New Guinea in 1949. In 1972, the name of the Territory changed to \\"Papua New Guinea\\" and in 1975 it became the independent nation of Papua New Guinea.  - Pomerania is a region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in Central Europe, split between Germany and Poland.  - The Battle of Cape Gloucester was a battle in the Pacific theater of World War II between Japanese and Allied forces which took place on the island of New Britain , Territory of New Guinea , between late December 1943 and April 1944 . The battle was a major part of Operation Cartwheel , the main Allied strategy in the South West Pacific Area and Pacific Ocean Areas during 1943 -- 44 , and was the second World War II landing of the U.S. 1st Marine Division , after Guadalcanal .  - The Territory of New Guinea was an Australian administered territory on the island of New Guinea from 1920 until 1975. In 1949, the Territory and the Territory of Papua were established in an administrative union by the name of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. That administrative union was renamed as Papua New Guinea in 1971. Notwithstanding that it was part of an administrative union, the Territory of New Guinea at all times retained a distinct legal status and identity until the advent of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.  - Rabaul is a township in East New Britain province, on the island of New Britain, in the country of Papua New Guinea. New Britain is an island about 60 kilometres to the east of the island of New Guinea. Rabaul was the provincial capital and most important settlement in the province until it was destroyed in 1994 by falling ash of a volcanic eruption.  - New Britain, is the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago (named after Otto von Bismarck) of Papua New Guinea. It is separated from the island of New Guinea by the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits and from New Ireland by St. George's Channel. The main towns of New Britain are Rabaul/Kokopo and Kimbe. The island is roughly the size of Taiwan. While the island was part of German New Guinea, it was named Neupommern (\\"New Pomerania\\").  - Kimbe is the capital of the province of West New Britain in Papua New Guinea. It is a port town on the great Kimbe Bay which boasts more than 60 percent of the coral species of the entire Indo-Pacific. The bustling town of Kimbe is the third largest port in Papua New Guinea and is the fastest growing city in the South Pacific. Accommodation in Kimbe is readily available in many high-class resorts and hotels, as well as many budget guesthouses and motels dribbled along the province. The town of Kimbe is served by Hoskins Airport.  - Vitiaz Strait is a strait between New Britain and the Huon Peninsula, northern New Guinea.   - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.  - German New Guinea was the first part of the German colonial empire. It was a protectorate from 1884 until 1914 when it fell to Australian forces following the outbreak of the First World War. It consisted of the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups. The mainland part of German New Guinea and the nearby islands of the Bismarck Archipelago and the North Solomon Islands are now part of Papua New Guinea. The Micronesian islands of German New Guinea are now governed as the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, the Northern Mariana Islands and Palau.  - Operation Cartwheel (19431944) was a major military strategy for the Allies in the Pacific theater of World War II. Cartwheel was a twin-axis of advance operation, aimed at militarily neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul. The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA)General Douglas MacArthurwhose forces advanced along the northeast coast of New Guinea and occupied nearby islands. Allied forces from the Pacific Ocean Areas commandunder Admiral Chester W. Nimitzadvanced through the Solomon Islands toward Bougainville. The Allied forces involved were from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the US and various Pacific Islands.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - Cape Gloucester (also known as Tuluvu) is a headland on the northern side of the far west of the island of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. During World War II, the Japanese captured New Britain, and had driven most of Cape Gloucester's native population out to construct two airfields. During the New Britain Campaign, American forces had decided to capture Cape Gloucester for its two airfields, to assist planned attacks on the garrison on Rabaul, an important area in New Britain. It became the site of the Battle of Cape Gloucester, part of Operation Cartwheel, in 1943. After long fighting through rain, and Japanese, the United States 1st Marine Division had it declared secured. After the war, the headland was given back to the natives.  - Papua New Guinea (PNG  Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815  30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, significantly and deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership. With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who \\"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers.\\"  - The Bismarck Archipelago is a group of islands off the northeastern coast of New Guinea in the western Pacific Ocean and is part of the Islands Region of Papua New Guinea. Its area is about 50,000 square km.  - Kokopo is the capital of East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. The capital was moved from Rabaul in 1994 when the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan erupted. As a result, the population of the town increased more than sixfold from 3,150 in 1990 to 20,262 in 2000.  - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy.  - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region.  - The Territory of Papua comprised the southeastern quarter of the island of New Guinea from 1883 to 1975. In 1883, the Government of Queensland annexed this territory for the British Empire. The United Kingdom Government refused to ratify the annexation but in 1884 a Protectorate was proclaimed over the territory, then called \\"British New Guinea\\". There is a certain ambiguity about the exact date on which the entire territory was annexed by the British. The Papua Act 1905 recites that this happened \\"on or about\\" 4 September 1888. On 18 March 1902, the Territory was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia. Resolutions of acceptance were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, who accepted the territory under the name of Papua.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. A woman named Cameo Crispi tried to set her ex-boyfriend's home on fire by burning a pound of bacon, police have said. The 31-year-old mother from Uintah County, Utah was arrested on March 14 and has been charged with arson. Her arrest came after her ex-boyfriend called Naples police to say that he had received numerous phone calls and texts from Crispi in just an hour and wanted her to stop, charging documents said. Caught: Cameo Crispi, left in her mug shot and right on Facebook, has been accused of trying to set her ex's home on fire by leaving a pound of bacon on the stove and scattering hot coals on the floor. Speaking with officers, he also said that he did not want her at his house. When an officer went to the home, he found Crispi there and noted she was drunk. He also saw smoke coming out of the front door, the Deseret News reported. 'I asked to come in and observed a wood stove left open with a fire burning inside and hot coals on the floor around the stove,' the officer wrote. He also found a cookie sheet covered with a pound of bacon sitting on top of the stove. 'I observed the burner to be on the setting \\"High\\" and the bacon to be severely burned and smoking badly,' the officer wrote. Mother: Crispi, who as allegedly drunk when she was arrested at her ex's home, is pictured with her son. Together: Crispi is pictured last November with a man she calls 'the love of my life'. The ex she allegedly targeted in the arson attempt has not been identified by police. The officer stopped the fire and arrested Crispi. A test found that she had a blood-alcohol content of 0.346 and she was taken to the hospital for a medical clearance before being booked into jail, the charging documents state. 'The doctor asked her about the fireâ€¦ and she stated she was attempting to start a fire in the house to get back at (her ex-boyfriend),' the charges state. Crispi is also charged with burglary, assault by a prisoner, interfering with an arresting officer, electronic communication harassment and intoxication. She is due in court on April 14.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

News article: Halfway through a long lunch at Tavern on the Green on a sunny September day, the trim, tanned filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson, dressed in a Southern California beach bum’s uniform — Quiksilver shorts, faded blue T-shirt, crumpled white bucket hat — went silent. Mr. Anderson, 44, had been asked a simple question: Does Thomas Pynchon, the reclusive author of “Gravity’s Rainbow,” “Mason & Dixon” and “The Crying of Lot 49,” make an on-screen cameo in Mr. Anderson’s “Inherent Vice,” the first movie adapted from one of the writer’s celebrated novels?      A cameo seems like the kind of sly prank that might amuse Mr. Pynchon, who has seemed to love hiding in plain sight since his spectacular rise to literary fame began with his 1963 novel, “V.” In 2004, he “appeared” in two throwaway bits on “The Simpsons,” and even then wore an animated bag over his presumably oversized and yellow head as he shouted, “Get your picture taken with a reclusive author!” In 2009, Mr. Pynchon narrated an online trailer for “Inherent Vice.” And his novels are littered with an obsessive cineaste’s catalog of obscure references.      A cameo would also be in keeping with the mischievous tone of Mr. Anderson’s madcap adaptation, which will have its premiere as the centerpiece of the New York Film Festival next Saturday, and open in theaters Dec. 12. A 180-degree turn from Mr. Anderson’s relentless oil odyssey “There Will Be Blood,” “Inherent Vice” is his most comedic and anarchic film since “Boogie Nights.” It’s a stoner detective film so overstuffed with visual gags and gimmicks that the filmmaker said he was inspired by slapstick spoofs like “Top Secret!” and “Airplane!” ||||| John Oliver Takes a Good Look at the Bad Apples Working in Police Forces      Watch the videos for \\"Don't Touch My Hair\\" and \\"Cranes in the Sky.\\"      Solange Knowles Dropped Two New Music Videos From A Seat at The Table      12:29 a.m.      Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Trailer Stars Ghost Pirates and a Drawing of Johnny Depp      The ghosts (and viewers) will have to wait until another trailer to find Jack Sparrow. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Oh, you're inquiring about that quite long piece of news, right?

Zane soon finds that he has been fired because of supposed budget cuts, and blacklisted, preventing him from working at other telescopes. Taking a job as a television satellite installer, he creates his own telescope array using his customers' dishes in the neighborhood, operating it secretly from his attic with help of his young next door neighbor, Kiki.Zane relocates the signal, but it is drowned out by a terrestrial signal from a Mexican radio station. Zane attempts to tell his former coworker, Calvin (Richard Schiff), but finds he has just died suspiciously from carbon monoxide poisoning. Zane travels to Mexico and finds the radio station was burnt to the ground. Searching the local area, he comes across a new power plant. There, he helps climatologist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse) protect her atmospheric analysis equipment from the plant's overzealous security forces.

Step 4: Finalize the appropriate option. The only option that remains applicable based on the above analysis is: - Furniture store: A store that sells a wide variety of furniture, including bookshelves, making it the most fitting place to find a brand new bookshelf.

Anson kicked the cat How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"The linguistic integrity of the sentence, \\"Anson kicked the cat,\\" can be analyzed by examining several components, including syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. In a nutshell, linguistic integrity refers to the coherence, logical structure, and meaningfulness of a sentence. In the case of the given sentence, we will break down these aspects to examine its linguistic integrity properly. 1. Syntax: Syntax is the arrangement of words and phrases, according to the rules of a language, to form well-structured sentences. In the given sentence, the word order follows the standard English subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern, with \\"Anson\\" as the subject, \\"kicked\\" as the verb, and \\"the cat\\" as the object. This sentence adheres to the syntactic rules of English grammar, making it a structurally sound and intelligible sentence. 2. Semantics: Semantics pertains to the meaning of words and phrases within a certain context. In this sentence, the semantics can be considered clear and straightforward. Each word is appropriate and conveys a specific meaning without ambiguity. The subject \\"Anson\\" refers to a person, the verb \\"kicked\\" denotes an action with a clear physical implication, and \\"the cat\\" clearly defines the object receiving the action. The sentence also employs an article \\"the\\" to specify a particular cat, further clarifying the meaning. As there is no lexical ambiguity or confusion, we can conclude that the sentence has a high level of semantic integrity. 3. Pragmatics: This aspect considers the contextual meaning and usage of a sentence in a communicative and social context. From a pragmatic perspective, the sentence is relatively clear and straightforward. It provides vital information about an action (kicking) performed by a specific person (Anson) on a specific object (the cat). However, the context behind this action remains unclear. For instance, we do not know why Anson kicked the cat, whether it was accidental or intentional, or even the consequences of this action.  To gauge the pragmatic integrity, it is essential to recognize the intent behind the given statement. Is the speaker merely sharing this piece of information or trying to evoke a certain reaction or emotion? Without more context, it is difficult to determine the pragmatic effectiveness of the sentence fully. In conclusion, \\"Anson kicked the cat\\" can be considered a syntactically and semantically coherent sentence due to its adherence to word order rules and avoiding lexical ambiguity. However, its pragmatic integrity can only be effectively assessed with more contextual information. Despite the lack of context, the sentence still delivers a clear, basic message about an action carried out by a subject on an object, demonstrating a reasonable level of linguistic integrity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: Sliced Apples Give the Apple Industry a Sales Boost Apple consumption is going up thanks to an unbelievably simple fix. It doesn’t take a group of researchers to figure out that kids prefer slices to whole apples, though it does take a group of researchers to calculate just how much they prefer them. The Washington Post reports that two studies found that apple consumption increased substantially when the fruit was served to school kids pre-sliced. One study conducted in eight schools found that consumption increased by over 60% when apples were served sliced. A follow-up study looking at six schools found similar results, as apple consumption grew by 70%. In 2014 Americans ate 511 million fresh sliced apples, a growth of about 350% from a decade earlier. Between 2010 and 2013, overall apple consumption grew by 13%; in 2013 Americans ate 17.5 pounds of apples per capita, the highest consumption had been in nearly 10 years. “Sliced apples just make a lot more sense for kids,” study author and behavioral economics professor David Just told the Post. It may seem silly to think of eating an apple in its natural, whole form as inconvenient. But for kids with missing teeth or braces, it is. “It’s one of those circumstances where what seems like a really small inconvenience actually makes a huge difference,” Just added. The USDA even recommends that fruit be served in “age-appropriate pieces.” McDonald’s noticed the convenience of pre-sliced apples earlier than most, and began selling them in 2004. Mark Seetin, director of regulatory and industry affairs for the U.S. Apple Association said that while school lunches were a “significant contributor” to increased consumption, “When a company as big as McDonald’s helps promote something, it not only boosts sales, but also really raises public awareness.” However, we also have to consider the potential environmental impact of pre-packaged apple slices. It helps reduce food waste, because less apples are thrown away, but slices tend to be served in plastic bags, increasing plastic waste—something that Whole Foods wfm was criticized for not too long ago. Sliced apples still only account for about 5% of all apple sales, though many expect that number will soon increase. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article highlights the significant increase in apple consumption in schools and the overall apple industry due to a simple fix: serving apples pre-sliced. According to two studies, apple consumption in schools increased by 60-70% when apples were served sliced. This is mainly because it is more convenient for children, especially those with missing teeth or braces. In 2014, Americans consumed 511 million fresh sliced apples, showing a growth of about 350% from a decade earlier. Between 2010 and 2013, overall apple consumption increased by 13%. The inclusion of sliced apples in school lunches and fast-food chains like McDonald's has contributed to the increased consumption and raised public awareness. However, the article also points out the potential environmental impact due to the increased use of plastic packaging for pre-sliced apples. On one hand, it helps reduce food waste as fewer apples are thrown away, but on the other hand, the use of plastic bags for packaging contributes to plastic waste. Despite the concerns, sliced apples account for only about 5% of all apple sales, and it is expected that this number will increase in the near future. Some key takeaways from the article include the positive impact of pre-sliced apples on apple consumption, the role of convenience in influencing children's food choices, and the need to balance the benefits with the potential environmental impact of packaging."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The governor general appoints, on the advice of the prime minister, the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) as the highest ranking commissioned officer in the Armed Forces and who, as head of the Armed Forces Council, is in command of the Canadian Forces. The Armed Forces Council generally operates from National Defence Headquarters (NDHQ) in Ottawa, Ontario. On the Armed Forces Council sit the heads of Canadian Joint Operations Command and Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, and the heads of the Royal Canadian Navy, the Canadian Army, the Royal Canadian Air Force and other key Level 1 organizations. The sovereign and most other members of the Canadian Royal Family also act as colonels-in-chief, honorary air commodores, air commodores-in-chief, admirals, and captains-general of Canadian Forces units, though these positions are ceremonial. What is the answer to this question: What are some of the members of the Armed Forces Council?","output":"The Armed Forces Council is a high-level military body in Canada that is responsible for overseeing the Canadian Armed Forces. Some of the key members of the Armed Forces Council include: 1. Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS): Appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister, the CDS serves as the highest-ranking commissioned officer in the Canadian Armed Forces and is the head of the Armed Forces Council, holding overall command of the Canadian Forces.  2. Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS): Assisting the CDS, the VCDS holds a crucial position within the Armed Forces Council. The VCDS is responsible for managing the general administration and coordination of the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence’s resources. 3. Commander of the Canadian Joint Operations Command (CJOC): As a key member of the Armed Forces Council, the Commander of CJOC oversees all the military operations involving the Canadian Armed Forces around the world. The CJOC ensures operational readiness and the successful execution of national and international military missions. 4. Commander of the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM): Responsible for special operations forces within the Canadian Armed Forces, the Commander of CANSOFCOM is another key member of the Armed Forces Council. CANSOFCOM carries out specialized and often covert missions and provides rapid response capabilities to the Canadian government. 5. Commander of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN): As the head of the Canadian Navy, the Commander of the RCN leads and directs naval operations and is responsible for maintaining maritime security and defence objectives for Canada. The Commander of the RCN is also a member of the Armed Forces Council. 6. Commander of the Canadian Army: Responsible for leading Canada's land forces, the Commander of the Canadian Army plays a critical role in the overall operations of the Canadian Armed Forces and participates as a member of the Armed Forces Council. 7. Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF): The Commander of the RCAF leads the air component of Canada's military, and is responsible for the planning, coordination, and execution of air force operations. The RCAF Commander sits as a member of the Armed Forces Council. In addition to these key members, other leaders of Level 1 organizations within the Canadian Forces may participate in the Armed Forces Council. While the Canadian Royal Family members, such as the Sovereign and other relatives, hold ceremonial positions within the Canadian Forces units (like colonels-in-chief, honorary air commodores, air commodores-in-chief, admirals, and captains-general), they typically do not participate in the Armed Forces Council's activities or decision-making."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In his first few races, Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew, while being intimidated on the track by Winston Cup Champion and dirty driver Rowdy Burns; these obstacles, combined with crashes and blown engines, prevent Cole from finishing the races. Discovering that Cole does not understand common NASCAR terminology, Harry puts him through rigorous training. This pays off at the Darlington race, when Cole uses a slingshot maneuver from the outside line to overtake Rowdy and win his first race. The rivalry between Cole and Rowdy intensifies throughout the season until the Firecracker 400 in Daytona, where both drivers are seriously injured after being caught in \\"The Big One\\". Recovering in Daytona Beach, Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr. Claire Lewicki, a neurosurgeon at Halifax Hospital. NASCAR President Big John brings Rowdy and Cole together in a meeting and warns them that he and his sport will no longer tolerate any hanky-panky from the two rivals. Persuaded by Big John, Cole and Rowdy have lunch and settle their differences by banging rental cars on the beach. The bitter rivals soon become close friends.

Question: What did the photos Melanie too of Clifford depict? Title: Amityville 3-D Movie plot: After he exposes a pair of con artists with his partner Melanie (Candy Clark) in the infamous 112 Ocean Avenue house in Amityville journalist John Baxter (Tony Roberts) is persuaded to purchase the house by real estate agent Clifford Sanders (John Harkins). While preparing the house for John, Clifford investigates footsteps in the attic. He is locked in the room, where a swarm of flies attack and kill him. John believes Clifford died of a stroke, even after Melanie shows him some photos she took of the real estate agent before his death which depict him as a rotting corpse. While John is at work, he nearly dies in a malfunctioning elevator. Simultaneously, Melanie experiences bizarre occurrences in John's house. She is found later that night by John, cowering and hysterical against the wall. Her attempts to convince John that something is inside the house fall on deaf ears. Later, while looking over blowups of the photos of Clifford, Melanie discovers a demonic-looking face in the pictures. When she attempts to show the photos to John, she is killed in a horrific car accident. Melanie's death is ruled accidental by everyone, including John, who remains oblivious to the evil in his home. While John is away one day his daughter Susan (Lori Loughlin) and her friend Lisa (Meg Ryan) and two boyfriends use a Ouija board in the attic. The game tells them Susan is in danger.

In the US alone, every year or two brings the discovery of mammoth bones uncovered by the construction of a subway, stadium, or parking lot. They don't stay mysteries for long.      But imagine it's 100 or 200 or 500 years ago, and you've just discovered the fossilized bones of a humongous creature with a 10-foot skull.      What would you think it was? A human giant from biblical times? You might. Or perhaps you'd look at the gaping hole in the front of the skull and think: Eek, Cyclops! Or a unicorn. Or, if you're extra-creative, a sea monster that somehow ended up on land (double eek!).      In his new book Discovering the Mammoth: A Tale of Giants, Unicorns, Ivory, and the Birth of a New Science, technical writer and self-described mammoth enthusiast John McKay digs deep into human history to explore how we tackled the perplexing mystery of these extraordinary fossils.      \\"Everybody has their own way of looking at the world,\\" McKay says, \\"but almost everywhere, people had no problem believing these were real animals or monsters that once lived.\\"      In an interview with the Monitor, McKay talks about the evolving fossil theories, the challenges that the bones posed to faith, and what this all says about the human drive to understand.      Q: So what was a woolly mammoth? A kind of prehistoric giant hairy elephant?      That's pretty much what it is. They're related to elephants, part of a big and complex family tree.      As they moved into colder areas, they got progressively stockier and hairier. They were still running around after the pyramids were built, and the final ones to go extinct were on an island north of Siberia. They seem to have mostly died from inbreeding. They were terribly inbred and started to develop genetic problems.      Q: How did people come to think these bones were of giant humans?      They're trying to make sense of something that has no analog in the world around them because they hadn't seen elephants yet. They'd know what the typical big animals in their area are like, and they'd notice that these aren't like any of the animals they hunt or see.      They'd find a femur or a thigh bone and start laying the bones out: Here's the legs, the hips, the ribs and 5-fingered feet that look like human hands. They'd put it all together and make it into a human.      Q: Sometimes they'd assume these were giant humans from the bible. But they'd also come up with out-there ideas like the Cyclops. How did they figure that?      If you look at an elephant's skull, there's this giant opening in the front for the trunk. It looks like a giant eyehole, so they developed the Cyclops idea. And the tusks looked like fangs, perfect for a monster.      Q: How did some Europeans figure that the bones weren't from actual animals?      Some people in the medieval and early modern periods thought these were just rocks that resembled bones. There was a little bit of mysticism mixed in it too, the belief that there were forces within the earth that could cause something to take on the appearance of something else.      Q: How did the sea monster theory develop?      There was a belief that for every animal on the land, there was an equivalent animal in the sea: There were sea cows, sea horses, sea dogs.      Q: How did mammoth fossils challenge religion?      There was an idea that goes all the way back to Aristotle of the sacred chain of being: Everything in God's creation is neatly ranked, there's a place for everything, everything is in its place, because God is perfect.      Whatever God creates will also be perfect because there's no room for superfluous parts. Extinction would be somewhat sacrilegious, almost heretical. God didn't make things without a purpose.      Thanks to the fossils, people also came to the conclusion that the past had taken more time than the standard biblical chronology. There needed to be more time for all of these things to happen. That made a lot of religious authorities uncomfortable.      Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

State media are reporting that the massive haul came from Russia and was seized in north-east China in February.      The largest piece of mammoth ivory seized was more than 1.6m (5ft) long, a customs officer was quoted as saying.      There is no international ban on the trade but Chinese officials said the haul was not declared.      Millions of mammoths      The stockpile is part of a booming trade between Russia and China in ivory taken from the skeletons of mammoths found in the Siberian tundra. The effects of global warming in the Arctic has made it easier to collect tusks preserved in ice for thousands of years, researchers say.      More than 100 woolly mammoth tusks were seized at the port of Luobei in Heilongjiang province, in addition to 37 woolly rhino horn parts and more than a tonne of jade. They were hidden in concealed compartments in a truck, according to reports.      Image copyright China News Service Image caption The tusks were seized in February but were shown to media earlier this week      The truck driver is alleged to have claimed he was only carrying soybeans, and to have fled the scene when the truck was inspected.      He and another person were later arrested.      Listen: The growing and legal trade in mammoth ivory (BBC Radio 4)      DNA clues to why woolly mammoth died out      There are estimated to be around 10 million mammoths that \\"remain incarcerated within the permafrost of the Arctic tundra\\", according to Douglas MacMillan, a professor of conservation and applied resource economics at the University of Kent.      Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Most of the world's woolly mammoths had died out by about 10,500 years ago      Some mammoth experts have suggested that the trade in mammoth ivory should be banned, even though the animals are extinct. They argue that their tusks are often sold as elephant tusks, and thus encourage overall demand for ivory.      It is estimated that more than 50% of the ivory sold into China, which has has the biggest ivory market in the world, is mammoth ivory. Hong Kong is a major destination, and the ivory is used to make jewellery and other objects, including ornamental tusks.      But other experts like Prof MacMillan say that a ban would not halt the trade but rather \\"drive it underground and attract the attention of organised crime groups\\".      Most of the world's woolly mammoths had died out by about 10,500 years ago. Scientists believe that human hunting and environmental changes played a role in their extinction.

Here is a more detailed analysis of the phrase: 1. The phrase starts by mentioning that the person is \\"considered a star.\\" This is a somewhat neutral statement, as it simply describes the person's status in society or within a specific context. However, it can be regarded as slightly positive, since being considered a star often implies success and popularity. 2. The phrase takes a turn with the use of the word \\"nor,\\" which is a conjunction that introduces a negative element to the following part of the sentence. This creates a juxtaposition in the sentence, contrasting the positive view of the person being a star against the negative points that come next. 3. The following part of the phrase, \\"why he keeps being cast in action films,\\" indicates the writer's confusion over the person's recurring appearances in such films. This statement could be interpreted as neutral if no negative connotation were attached to it; however, the previous use of \\"nor\\" warns the reader that this question is part of a negative thought. 4. The phrase ends with a strong negative assertion: \\"when none of them are ever any good.\\" Here, the writer directly states that the action films the person is cast in are never good, which sharply criticizes both the quality of the films and the person's suitability or contribution to those films. This part of the sentence showcases that the overall sentiment towards the person and the action films he stars in is negative. So, when analyzing the whole phrase, it can be determined that it carries a predominantly negative sentiment, with a hint of a positive aspect at the beginning. However, the negative aspects of the statement—being critical of the person's casting choices and the quality of their associated films—far outweigh the positive notion of being a star."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which process would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, process A or process B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Process B. To understand why process B causes more oxygen and glucose to be sent to the muscles, it is crucial to know the hormones produced and functions of the adrenal glands' cortex and medulla. The adrenal glands have two distinct parts: the outer cortex and the inner medulla. Each of them has a unique function, secreting different hormones that play vital roles in the body. Process A: Hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex The adrenal cortex is primarily responsible for producing corticosteroids - hormones that regulate metabolism, immune response, and other essential functions. There are two main types of hormones produced by the adrenal cortex: 1. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, have a wide range of effects, including regulating glucose metabolism, suppressing the immune system, and helping the body respond to stress. 2. Mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, help maintain the balance of sodium and potassium in the body and regulate blood pressure. These hormones play essential roles in maintaining homeostasis, but they do not directly cause an increase in the supply of oxygen and glucose to the muscles in significant amounts. Process B: Hormones secreted by the adrenal medulla The adrenal medulla is part of the sympathetic nervous system and produces catecholamines – the most important of which are adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). During times of stress or perceived danger, the adrenal medulla releases these hormones into the bloodstream. These hormones have a direct impact on the \\"fight or flight\\" response, preparing the body for immediate action. The release of catecholamines triggers a series of physiological changes, including: 1. Increased heart rate and stronger contractions, which in turn result in increased blood flow. The increased circulation brings more oxygen and nutrients (including glucose) to the muscles, supplying them with the energy needed for intense physical activity. 2. Enhanced lung function, widening the airways, allowing for more oxygen to be taken in and transported to the muscles. 3. Mobilization of glucose and fatty acids from storage sites, increasing the availability of these fuel sources for muscles and other organs. In conclusion, process B, which involves the secretion of hormones from the adrenal medulla, directly leads to an increase in both oxygen and glucose availability to the muscles. This occurs as part of the body's \\"fight or flight\\" response, as the body is prepared to either confront or flee from potential danger. By contrast, process A (secretion of hormones from the adrenal cortex) is mainly involved in maintaining homeostasis and does not have the same direct effect on oxygen and glucose availability to the muscles."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Time and again ancient ‘bog bodies’, and their remarkably well-preserved features dating back thousands of years, have left scientists speechless. These eerie cadavers are naturally mummified within a peat bog that preserves intricate details, such forehead creases and even laughter lines. Now, the incredible properties of peat are being used by the beauty industry to create skincare products that claim to promote youth and cure skin damage. Scroll down for video. Bill Kenny from Croghan Hill was inspired to launch the the peat-based Ógra skincare range after seeing the well-preserved Iron Age body of 'Old Croghan Man' (pictured) found in a bog in 2003. One such company is Tullamore-based Ógra who is using peat to create a range of luxury skincare products, according to a report by Audrey McGlinchy in Narratively. The Irish group has made use of local peat, which is the material formed when plant remains partially decompose. This particular peat in County Offaly has one of the highest concentration of antioxidants in the world. Bogs, which are particularly common in Ireland, contain this peat which as the bog grows, gets pushed deeper beneath the surface. Bogs, which are particularly common in Ireland, contain peat which as the bog grows, gets pushed deeper beneath the surface. Inspired by peat's protective powers, Mr Kenny started Ógra - the Irish word for ‘youth’. The company now sells peat-based skincare products such as the Peat Face and Body Mask for £40 (66) Away from oxygen, the bacteria that break down matter can’t survive, which means the deeper you dig in a bog, the greater peat’s youthful power. Bill Kenny, founder of Ógra, lives just few miles away from a 14-acre bog near Croghan Hill in which the Iron Age ‘Old Croghan Man’ was discovered in 2003. Promotes youthfulness – According to Ogra, the skincare company, peat contains strong antioxidants that can combat free radical damage. This free radical damage is generally recognised as the main cause of premature ageing. Peat contains trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, selenium as well as partially rotted plants such as bog whortleberry. It is also alleged to promote an increase in collagen production which helps to increase cell regeneration and slow down the ageing process. Astringency – It claims to tighten the pores which gives the skin a smoother look. Detoxifier – The company claim that peat stimulates the lymphatic system and is therefore a very effective detoxifier. Peat removes dead skin cells, toxins and other impurities from your skin. PH balance - The natural abundance of essential oils and fatty acids penetrate into the skin and are thought to to re-establish the skin’s natural PH balance. Source: Ogra Skincare. ‘I remember the police superintendent phoning me up to tell me they’d found a body in the peat,’ the former construction worker told MailOnline. ‘I thought maybe it was a murder victim, but when I spoke to the superintendent that evening he told me the man was there for thousands of years. ‘He was so well-preserved, they could tell you what he ate the day he died, and by the pollen in his nostrils, what time of year he died.’ Inspired by these protective powers, Mr Kenny started Ógra - the Irish word for ‘youth’. The company now sells peat-based skincare products such as the Peat Face and Body Mask for £40 (66). Last year, Ógra Skincare sent a batch of peat to Glasgow University to be dated and they found that Mr Kenny’s bog is more than 9,000 years old. The peat, they discovered, contained 98 to 99 per cent organic materials, including high levels of antioxidants and antiseptics. The main antioxidant is trolox, the water-soluble equivalent of vitamin E. The product also contains magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, copper, iron and zinc. Recalling his earliest memory of peat, Mr Kenny is still amazed by it ‘magical properties’. ‘When I was seven, my hand was badly burnt by a pot of water,’ he told MailOnline. ‘I got up and all the skin on my hand fell, it was red raw, just like a piece of liver. ‘My mother put me on a bicycle and took me to a peat bog that we own just a mile away. She mixed up the peat and she put my hand straight down into it. ‘The only thing I can remember about that, is that once I entered my hand into the peat there was no more pain… I thought, there must be something fabulous in peat.’ Bill Kenny, founder of Ógra, lives just few miles away from a fourteen-acre bog near Croghan Hill in which the Iron Age ‘Old Croghan Man’ was discovered.

According to a close friend, he and Crazy Horse \\"were both born in the same year at the same season of the year,\\" which census records and other interviews place in 1842. Encouraging Bear, an Oglala medicine man and spiritual adviser to the Oglala war leader, reported that Crazy Horse was born \\"in the year in which the band to which he belonged, the Oglala, stole One Hundred Horses, and in the fall of the year,\\" a reference to the annual Lakota calendar or winter count. Among the Oglala winter counts, the stealing of 100 horses is noted by Cloud Shield, and possibly by American Horse and Red Horse owner, as equivalent to the year 1840-41. In the fall of 1870, Crazy Horse invited Black Buffalo Woman to accompany him on a buffalo hunt in the Slim Buttes area of present-day northwestern South Dakota. She was the wife of No Water, who had a reputation for drinking too much. It was Lakota custom to allow a woman to divorce her husband at any time. She did so by moving in with relatives or with another man, or by placing the husband's belongings outside their lodge. Although some compensation might be required to smooth over hurt feelings, the rejected husband was expected to accept his wife's decision. No Water was away from camp when Crazy Horse and Black Buffalo Woman left for the buffalo hunt.  No Water tracked down Crazy Horse and Black Buffalo Woman in the Slim Buttes area. When he found them in a teepee, he called Crazy Horse's name from outside. When Crazy Horse answered, No Water stuck a pistol into the teepee and aimed for Crazy Horse. Touch the Clouds, Crazy Horse's first cousin and son of Lone Horn, was sitting in the teepee nearest the entry. He knocked the pistol upward as No Water fired, deflecting the bullet to Crazy Horse's upper jaw. No Water left, with Crazy Horse's relatives in hot pursuit. No Water ran his horse until it died and continued on foot until he reached the safety of his own village.  Several elders convinced Crazy Horse and No Water that no more blood should be shed. As compensation for the shooting, No Water gave Crazy Horse three horses. Because Crazy Horse was with a married man's wife, he was stripped of his title as Shirt Wearer (leader).","output":"This text is about Crazy Horse, a Native American war leader of the Oglala Lakota tribe. Crazy Horse was born between 1840 and 1845, and he played a significant role in the resistance against the United States government's efforts to force the Sioux people onto reservations during the late 1800s. The text mentions a specific incident involving Crazy Horse, Black Buffalo Woman, and No Water. Black Buffalo Woman was married to No Water, but according to the Lakota custom, she had the right to divorce her husband at any time. She decided to leave him and join Crazy Horse for a buffalo hunt in the Slim Buttes area of present-day northwestern South Dakota. No Water, upset by his wife’s decision, tracked them down and shot Crazy Horse in the face, aiming for his upper jaw. However, Touch the Clouds, Crazy Horse's first cousin, intervened and deflected the bullet. After the shooting, the elders from both Crazy Horse's and No Water's villages intervened and convinced them not to continue the violence. No Water compensated Crazy Horse for the aggression by giving him three horses. As a result of this incident, Crazy Horse was stripped of his title as Shirt Wearer (leader) because he was with a married woman. Crazy Horse is known for his bravery and prowess in battle, as well as his dedication to the preservation of the Lakota way of life.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - She has recorded with Yellow Magic Orchestra and its members Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, as well as with Swing Out Sister, Pat Metheny, The Chieftains, Lyle Mays, members of Little Feat, David Sylvian, Mick Karn, Kenji Omura, Gil Goldstein, Toninho Horta, Mino Cinelu, Jeff Bova, Charlie Haden, Peter Erskine, Anthony Jackson, David Rhodes, Bill Frisell, Thomas Dolby, the band Quruli, Rei Harakami as yanokami and her daughter Miu Sakamoto.  - Biography.

Both teams attempt to score points by passing the ball through the opponent's hoop while also trying to prevent the opposing team from scoring. The team with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.  On the other hand, baseball is a sport typically played outdoors in a baseball field, also known as a diamond. The game involves two teams consisting of nine players each, who alternate between playing offense (batting) and defense (fielding). The objective of the game is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and then running around a series of bases, completing a circuit of four bases to score a run. The team that scores the most runs by the end of nine innings is considered the winner. Considering these differences in sports, the statement \\"Two people are watching a basketball game on a flat screen television.\\" cannot be equated to them watching a baseball game. The focus remains solely on their engagement with a basketball game, and it does not provide any information about them also watching or having any interest in a baseball game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alison, who suffers through the evening's by-play, has been ill since the death, three years prior, of her malormed baby.

Based on a survey of 8,000 teachers and a review of research, the report says drilling for tests has narrowed what children are learning. The government said it is determined to ensure every child is able to realise their potential. The report, Exam Factories? The Impact of Accountability Measures on Children and Young People, by Prof Merryn Hutchings of London Metropolitan University, says pupils' emotional health and wellbeing is suffering because of \\"high-stakes testing\\". These are the national tests, exams and progress measures which the government uses to hold schools to account. Most teachers surveyed for the report agreed pupils became \\"very stressed/anxious in the time leading up to Sats/public examinations\\". One teacher said: \\"You just see them sat there, a 10- or 11-year-old kid in complete meltdown.\\" Another said: \\"I have just had a child off school for three days because he was so worried about his recent test result and didn't want to take any more tests.\\" Lucie Russell, director of campaigns at mental health charity Young Minds, which backed the report, said: \\"Both pupils and teachers are under a lot of pressure to achieve results in a pressure cooker, exam factory environment. \\"Many of the young people Young Minds works with say that they feel completely defined by their grades and that this is very detrimental to their wellbeing and self-esteem.\\" According to the report, the tests affect both able and less able pupils similarly. One secondary school special-needs co-ordinator said: \\"The higher ability [pupils], and the ones with the very supportive or pushy parents, are receiving higher levels of stress because of how much is being expected of them. \\"I think the lower end or those with maybe less supportive parents as well are suffering from the fact that they are not being given a curriculum that suits them.\\" The report also argued the focus on testing was harming pupil-teacher relationships, with teachers less able to view pupils in the round. One junior school teacher said: \\"I am in danger of seeing them more in terms of what colour they are in my pupils' list eg are they red (below expectation), green (above expectation) or purples (Pupil Premium) - rather than as individuals.\\" Kevin Courtney, deputy general-secretary of the NUT, said: \\"Teachers at the sharp end are saying this loud and clear, 'If it isn't relevant to a test then it is not seen as a priority.' \\"The whole culture of a school has become geared towards meeting government targets and Ofsted expectations. As this report shows, schools are on the verge of becoming 'exam factories'.\\" He argued the accountability agenda was \\"damaging children's experience of education\\", which should be joyful and leave them with \\"a thirst for knowledge for the rest of their lives\\". A Department for Education spokesperson said: \\"Part of our commitment to social justice is the determination to ensure every child is given an education that allows them realise their potential. \\"That's why we are raising standards with a rigorous new curriculum, world class exams and new accountability system that rewards those schools which help every child to achieve their best.\\"","output":"The National Union of Teachers' report highlights that students are developing stress-related conditions due to the increased focus on testing in schools. The study, based on a survey of 8,000 teachers and a review of research, states that drilling for tests has limited the scope of learning for children. The government, on the other hand, is committed to ensuring every child can realize their potential. The report, titled \\"Exam Factories?

They came together in a chance meeting on the way home from work. Next year the meeting will be in Chicago.","output":"No, the word \\"meeting\\" in these two sentences has different meanings. In English, the term \\"meeting\\" can be used in various contexts, and in these particular sentences, it represents two distinct concepts. In the first sentence, \\"They came together in a chance meeting on the way home from work,\\" the meaning of \\"meeting\\" refers to an unplanned and unexpected encounter between two or more people. In this context, the emphasis is on the coincidental nature of the interaction, suggesting that the involved parties did not prearrange or intentionally plan to meet one another. The phrase \\"chance meeting\\" serves to emphasize the element of surprise and randomness in this encounter. In the second sentence, \\"Next year the meeting will be in Chicago,\\" the meaning of \\"meeting\\" refers to a prearranged and formal gathering of individuals, typically for a specific purpose, such as discussing business, exchanging ideas, or making decisions. The word \\"meeting\\" in this case often implies that the gathering is scheduled and organized, possibly involving a set agenda and a group of attendees who share common interests or objectives. This type of meeting can be held for various purposes, such as conferences, workshops, or seminars, and might involve presentations, collaborations, or networking. It is essential to acknowledge that English has many homographs like \\"meeting,\\" where a single word can have multiple meanings depending on the context in which it is used. These variations in meaning are crucial in understanding and interpreting the different situations and ideas conveyed by the sentences. So, although the word \\"meeting\\" appears in both sentences, it has a different connotation in each scenario, highlighting the diverse ways language can be used to express different concepts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: Whether influenza vaccination influences the severity of illness in cases of clinical failure in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients receiving influenza vaccine has not been extensively studied. Our goal was to evaluate the frequency of influenza vaccination among SOT recipients with influenza disease and its impact on the illness severity during the 2010-2011 season. Adult SOT recipients with confirmed influenza infection were included from December 2010 to April 2011. Follow-up data were recorded and antibody titres were determined using a microneutralization assay. Sixty-four SOT recipients were included in the study, ten (15.6%) with severe disease, requiring admission to intensive care units, of whom four (6.3%) died. In all, 34 (53.1%) received the 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine and 32 (50.0%) received the 2009-H1N1 pandemic vaccine, and none had detectable antibodies against influenza at the time of diagnosis of influenza infection. Twenty-three (67.6%) of the patients that received the vaccine required hospital admission and presented less dyspnoea (10, 29.4% versus 14 (50.0%), p 0.09) and pneumonia (8, 23.8% versus 15, 50.0%, p 0.03, relative risk 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9) than unvaccinated patients, with relative risk reductions of 60% and 70%, respectively. Although influenza vaccination confers protection on SOT recipients against developing influenza pneumonia, the rate of clinical failure is still high. New strategies to improve influenza immunization are needed for this group of patients.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who didn't finish the normal high magnification search before Waddle took the periscope? is inside the article: As Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens.  Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room.  At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14.  Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow  accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course.  Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface).  At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction.  Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators.  Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low  magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships.

And she didn't deserve this horrible tripe that Warner Bros. threw her way!  The two-pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme. Kay is a small-town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a big-shot actor comes to town and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities, Kay tells her husband she's going to the movies. The hubby's biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby's ear that Kay's not being truthful, and he sets out looking for her. He finds her w/ the actor in the hotel (they are only talking!) and he slugs the guy, who falls over a railing, lands face-first in a pond (lake?), and dies. Now here's the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based:  1) the judge tells the jury that if it's determined that the man died *before* his head went into the water, that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder. (Whaaaaa?????? I think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most, not FIRST DEGREE murder. Give me a break! But the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life. Whatever.)  2) the hubby's lawyer, after the conviction and sentencing, tells Kay that it's all HER fault. His reasoning is that if she hadn't gone over to the actor's room, then her husband wouldn't have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him. He tells her that she's the guilty one, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the movie is all about Kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place. I can't even go on with this review. The movie was just all too painful. Four years earlier, in the pre-code days, you'd never have caught Kay playing such a wimp! In true Kay Francis fashion, though, she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character. I give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role. This character was a far cry from pre-code Kay roles and real-life spitfire Kay Francis. Steer way clear of this one! There are much better Kay Francis vehicles out there! (From personal experience, I can highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery; also good are Dr. Monica and One Way Passage.

The task at hand is to insert space between the words to make the string meaningfully readable.

Does \\"draw\\" mean the same thing in these two sentences? Draw parallels. He drew an elaborate plan of attack.","output":"No, the word \\"draw\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. The term \\"draw\\" has different meanings depending on its context, and in these two sentences it's being used to convey two different ideas. In the first sentence - Draw parallels - \\"draw\\" refers to identifying or finding similarities or connections between two or more things. Drawing parallels means comparing different subjects, situations, or objects and pointing out the ways in which they are alike. Here, \\"draw\\" serves as a metaphor, suggesting that the one who is \\"drawing\\" is bringing forth these connections and analogies like an artist creating lines on a canvas. In the second sentence - He drew an elaborate plan of attack - \\"draw\\" is being used to convey the idea of creating or designing something, which in this case is a plan. The act of drawing here refers to coming up with a detailed strategy or layout, possibly involving sketching or mapping out the plan visually. This sense of \\"draw\\" is more literal, as it implies the process of physically putting pen to paper to create a visual representation of the idea. While both uses of \\"draw\\" invoke the concept of the creation process, they denote different kinds of creative activity: one is centered around finding similarities and making comparisons (as in drawing parallels), while the other focuses on designing, outlining, or schematically representing ideas (as in drawing a plan)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"America is not strongest when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.\\"?","output":"We cannot conclude that \\"America is not strongest when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side\\" based on the provided paragraph. Quite the opposite, the paragraph posits that one key factor in relieving pressure on armed forces is running a foreign policy that recognizes that America is at its strongest when it works with real alliances and shares the burdens of the world through high-level statesmanship and diplomacy to bring other nations to its side. The paragraph essentially emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and collaboration in foreign policy decisions, rather than advocating for isolationism or an overly aggressive stance. The idea presented is that America's strength lies in its ability to forge and maintain strong relationships with other nations, working together to address global challenges and alleviate the stress placed on its military. This belief in the power of alliances and diplomacy can be historically supported by the fact that some of America's most significant international accomplishments have been achieved through the cooperation with other nations, such as the establishment of the United Nations, NATO, and other international agreements and treaties. It is important to understand that the paragraph does not explicitly claim that America is weaker when not pursuing diplomacy and alliances; rather, it highlights the positive outcomes of a collaborative approach to foreign policy. The argument being made is that by fostering strong alliances, working through diplomacy, and sharing global responsibilities, America can make itself even stronger and more effective on the world stage."},{"instruction":"Title: I couldnt even finish this one.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: After commuting, cooking dinner and doing household chores, the average parent has just 30 minutes to devote to their children in the evenings, according to a new study. One in four working parents worry that half an hour simply isn't enough, while almost half fret that they aren't a good enough parent during the week. However, parenting experts believe just 12 minutes a day may be enough for mothers and fathers to fully _ with their child -- as long as they ask the right questions. Child psychologist Dr Claire Halsey said asking a series of open-ended questions can help improve parents' relationship with their children. Among the questions recommended in the research are: \\"How many times have you smiled today -- what made you laugh?\\"; \\"Can you act out what you did at breaktime?\\"; \\"Who is taller -- mummy or your teacher?\\" and \\"What are the names of the toys you played with today?\\" Parents of older children are advised to start up a conversation with: \\"I've got a great story for you but I want one in return... you first!\\" or \\"Tell me some school gossip ... _ !\\" Dr Halsey, working with the makers of Ribena Plus, who commissioned the research, said: \\"There is no one as tough on their own parenting skills as a parent -- but this study shows there is no need for parents to be so harsh. It's hard for working parents to juggle all their responsibilities and it can feel like guilt is simply a parent's lot -- but it's absolutely not. By using clever tactics such as a little preparation alongside use of open-ended questions -- such as 'Tell me what the best bit about your day was?' -- parents can reduce the time worrying about chores and work and spend more time learning about their children's day.\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"According to the article, what is the average amount of time parents spend with their children in the evenings after completing daily tasks, and how can parents improve their relationship with their children?

Article: When we give our kids holiday gifts, many of us can't wait to hear their appreciative cries of\\"thank you!\\"once the wrapping gets ripped off. But here's a tip: You'd be wise not to expect much gratitude from them for what they receive. Gratitude can make us happier, healthier, and even fitter. But do the kids show their gratitude for the stuff we buy them? All the research I've done has convinced me that it won't happen. One mom told me that when she asked her 16-year-old son to thank her for buying him a cellphone, he said, \\"But that's what moms should do.\\" From a teenager's angle, it's a parent's responsibility to take care of the family. According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, \\"When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily\\"--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation. Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward. You can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed. Once the conversation about gratitude gets started, it's much easier to continue all year. Also you can set up a family routine at bedtime where kids describe three things that have made them grateful.

A gangster is believed to have sent a spray of bullets into the sky as the torch relay passed close to the Complexo de Chapadao favela in northwestern Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday. The National Security Force ordered the relay team to speed up - which they did sprinting down a busy road.

Locals lining the streets, waiting to see the relay, were left gobsmacked by the reaction,with many laughing as the team scarpered past in a flash. But others said the incident has turned the country into a \\"laughing stock\\". The torch was in its final stages of a 125,000 mile journey across the country. The relay has been besieged with incidents with protesters interrupting its journey trying to grab the torch and throwing water over bearers. Police have been forced to use grenades and tear gas to secure its passage to the games, which opened last night.

Hypothesis: A man is buying steel. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. The premise simply states that there's a man in a white shirt and hard hat working with steel, which could entail a variety of actions or tasks related to steel. This information alone does not help us determine whether he is buying steel or not. Working with steel can involve several tasks or roles, such as manufacturing, fabricating, welding, constructing, designing, inspecting, or even selling steel. Thus, it is important to analyze each aspect and possibility within the premise. Firstly, the man's attire and hard hat suggest that he is engaged in a construction or industrial setting; this means that he is likely working on-site, following safety protocols, and adhering to occupational standards. Wearing a hard hat indicates a potentially hazardous work environment, and is common within construction, engineering, and manufacturing industries. The white shirt may represent his role within the organization or simply be a choice of clothing for visibility and comfort. Secondly, the description primarily highlights the man's interaction with steel. Steel is a versatile and widely-used material found in numerous industries and applications. In construction, it serves as a critical component for building structures, reinforcing concrete, or manufacturing large-scale infrastructures like bridges or skyscrapers. Within manufacturing, steel is routinely utilized to produce various industrial products, tools, home appliances, and automotive parts. In all of these scenarios, the man could be actively working with steel but may not necessarily be purchasing it. Given the possibilities mentioned above – including potential roles in manufacturing, fabrication, construction, or inspection – we cannot confidently infer that the man is buying steel from the premise alone. There is insufficient evidence to establish a direct connection between the man's actions and purchasing steel. It is essential to consider other explanations or explore additional context and information to understand the relationship between the premise and hypothesis fully. In conclusion, while the premise provides a snapshot of the man dressed appropriately in a specific work setting and interacting with steel, it does not offer enough evidence to substantiate the hypothesis that he is buying steel. This highlights the importance of not jumping to conclusions based on incomplete or vague information and considering alternative interpretations when evaluating claims or observations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Google Takes On China BURLINGAME, Calif. -- Google took an exceptionally hard line against China late Tuesday, naming it as the source of a large-scale cyber attack last month, aimed at breaching the security of Google and some 20 other companies. The attack and other \\"attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the Web,\\" Google said, \\"have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China.\\" There was no underplaying the move by Google ( GOOG - news - people ), which like many U.S. companies has been circumspect about offending the Chinese government. The news appeared on two different Google blogs, with several members of Google's public affairs staff flagging the announcement in other venues. The main statement was signed by David Drummond, Google's top lawyer. Drummond wrote that in mid-December Google had detected a major attack on its infrastructure originating from China. On investigation, Drummond's post said, \\"we have discovered that at least 20 other large companies from a wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted.\\" Google did not identify the companies, but said it is notifying them of the attack. The aim of this attack, and other breaches it has uncovered, was to access e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights campaigners worldwide. Drummond's post strongly implied Google believes the attacks were linked to the Chinese government itself. However, a Google spokesperson said that the companys investigation couldnt determine whether the hackers who had accessed Googles network were state-sponsored. Drummond referred in his post to Ghostnet, a Chinese surveillance system that was revealed to be monitoring companies and non-governmental organizations last March by the Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian group focused on Internet censorship and cyber warfare. But a Google spokesperson said that the connection between Ghostnet and the companys hacking incident wasnt definitive either. Ron Deibert, director of Citizen Lab and an author of that report, told Forbes that he had learned information about the attacks from Google that led him to believe they were perpetrated by different hackers from those participating in Ghostnet. The attackers' efforts, Google said, have been almost entirely unsuccessful. Google said it has made improvements to its computer architecture that will prevent further such attempts. But the tone and nature of its statement also showed that Google is hoping to use publicity to change Chinese behavior. \\"We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed,\\" Google said, \\"but also because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech.\\" Google said it is no longer willing to filter its search results in China to eliminate sites the government does not like. While it will try to work with the authorities to develop an acceptable unfiltered search engine, Google said, \\"we recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.\\" Google runs a distant second in China to Beijing-based Baidu, which has 60% of the Chinese search market, according to Analysys International. (See \\"The Man Who's Beating Google\\") The news last year that Google's head of China operations, Li Kaifu, was leaving the company sparked speculation that Google was set to abandon the country, however, it said in September that it would double its China-based staff. A Google spokesperson says Kaifu's departure wasnt related to the cybersecurity investigation. Though Google doesnt reveal how much of its revenue is drawn from China, investors seemed to think Tuesday's news would hurt. The companys stock fell 1.8% in after-hours trading. But Citizen Labs Ron Deibert argued that the move could help Google in the long term by bolstering the companys Do No Evil image and putting pressure on Yahoo! and Microsoft to follow in its footsteps. Google is making a principled decision that their services cant be compromised, says Deibert. This may be a shakeup that causes lots of companies to reflect on what they need to do to keep the Internet free and open. Google Bows To Chinese Writers Google's Nexus One: Winners And Losers What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Google having problems with China.

Google also said it no longer wants to change its search results in China to remove things the Chinese government doesn't like. This might cause Google to have to close its website and offices in China.

Article: I was just out of college, only three days into a graduate  year in England,and I was pulling a heavy bag and suitcase through the London Underground. I was also crying out of control. The day before yesterday, my uncle told me never to speak to him, his wife, or my two cousins again.Earlier,  I made a joke. I didn't mean to hurt my aunt's feelings, but it did.I spent the evening in an ugly blue telephone booth  . crying as I spoke to a family friend who lived in England. When I left the phone booth, I went back to a silent house with three closed bedroom doors. In the morning, I heard everyone get up and leave for work and school. I wrote a note to say sorry and pulled my bags to the train station. When I got into London, I had to take the underground to Angel Station to get to my family friend's house. I was familiar with the underground, but at the time, it was just endless white tiles .Coming to England seemed like a bad decision. Crying yet again, I tried to lift my suitcase up the stairs. When I was trying hard to walk forward, there were hands. Each time I faced another group of steps,a hand would lift the suitcase. At the top of the steps, the hand would let go, and I'd pull the suitcase to the next group. And just as I wanted to try again,another hand would appear. It happened several times. I never looked up, because I couldn't stop crying.Each hand looked different, and many different people helped me, without asking or saying anything. I couldn't look up. I wasn't able to say thank you. I went on to have an amazing year studying in England, but that was the last time I saw or spoke to any of my uncle's family. Yet when I think about _ in 2008, I remember those strangers' hands. They were there when I needed them, and even now, they help me out of the sadness of that memory.

Please answer this question: Sine, cosine and tangent are the three most familiar functions in which branch of mathematics?","output":"Sine, cosine, and tangent are the three most familiar functions in the branch of mathematics known as trigonometry. Trigonometry is a division of mathematics that deals primarily with the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, specifically right-angled triangles. The word 'trigonometry' comes from the Greek words 'trigonon,' meaning \\"triangle,\\" and 'metron,' meaning \\"measure.\\" Therefore, trigonometry is essentially the study of measurements of triangles. In trigonometry, the sine (abbreviated as sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) functions are used to define and calculate the ratios between the lengths of the sides and angles of a right-angled triangle. These functions are fundamentally connected to the angles of a triangle, and they play a central role in solving various mathematical problems related to triangles. The sine, cosine, and tangent functions are defined as follows: 1. Sine Function (sin(θ)): The sine function represents the ratio between the length of the side opposite the angle θ (theta) and the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side of a right-angled triangle, opposite the right angle). Mathematically, sin(θ) = opposite side / hypotenuse. 2. Cosine Function (cos(θ)): The cosine function represents the ratio between the length of the adjacent side to the angle θ (theta) and the length of the hypotenuse. Mathematically, cos(θ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse. 3. Tangent Function (tan(θ)): The tangent function represents the ratio between the opposite side and the adjacent side to the angle θ (theta). Tangent can also be expressed as the ratio between sine and cosine functions, i.e., tan(θ) = sin(θ) / cos(θ). Trigonometry has applications in various areas, including geometry, calculus, physics, engineering, and even in the study of periodic phenomena in general. Its primary purpose is to establish relationships between angles and lengths of triangles, enabling us to solve real-world problems involving angles or distances that might otherwise be challenging to measure directly. For example, trigonometry helps us calculate the angles and distances in problems involving navigation and Astronomical studies, analyze wave patterns in sound and light, or determine the forces and stress in structures like bridges and buildings. Specifically, the sine, cosine, and tangent functions enable the calculation of unknown sides and angles of right-angled triangles, forming the basis for the solutions of these practical problems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who, along with his college, pioneered the study of Blakeney Point? ?  In the decades preceding World War I, this stretch of coast became famous for its wildfowling; locals were looking for food, but some more affluent visitors hunted to collect rare birds; Norfolk's first barred warbler was shot on the point in 1884. In 1901, the Blakeney and Cley Wild Bird Protection Society created a bird sanctuary and appointed as its \\"watcher\\", Bob Pinchen, the first of only six men, up to 2012, to hold that post.In 1910, the owner of the Point, Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe, leased the land to University College London (UCL), who also purchased the Old Lifeboat House at the end of the spit. When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development. In 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust. UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point. The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre. Despite formal protection, the tern colony was not fenced off until the 1960s.The Point was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1954, along with the adjacent Cley Marshes reserve, and subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986. The larger area is now additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, IUCN category IV (habitat/species management area) and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Point became a National Nature Reserve (NNR) in 1994, and the coast from Holkham NNR to Salthouse, together with Scolt Head Island, became a Biosphere Reserve in 1976.","output":"The first name of the person who, along with his college, pioneered the study of Blakeney Point is Francis.

That means we'll add or subtract the numbers next to \\"s\\" together. -44s - 48s + 88s = -44s - 48s + 88s = (-44 - 48 + 88) × s. When we subtract 44 from 48, it equals -92. Now, we have: -92s + 88s = -44. Now, let's add 88 to -92, that equals -4. So, our equation becomes: -4s = -44. Now, we want to find the value of \\"s\\".

Step 3: Choose the best answer \\"Report for duty\\" is the most appropriate answer since it represents the immediate action Brian needs to take upon being called back to active service. Once he reports for duty, he can then wait for orders, follow them, and potentially fight for freedom if necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, \\"He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart.\\" When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon.Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: Early Seventies Britain was a very depressing place. It was completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from the wrong side of the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then a whole bunch of copycat wankers after us. Their first gig was arranged by Matlock, who was studying at Saint Martins College. The band played at the school on 6 November 1975, in support of a pub rock group called Bazooka Joe, arranging to use their amps and drums. The Sex Pistols performed several cover songs, including the Who's \\"Substitute\\", the Small Faces' \\"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\\", and \\"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\\", made famous by the Monkees; according to observers, they were unexceptional musically aside from being extremely loud.

Phil is stabbed through the ear in a bathroom stall while trying to eavesdrop on strange whimpering noises. The killer, wearing a Ghostface costume, then returns to the screening and sits beside Maureen before mortally stabbing her. At first the audience believes she is part of the raucous acting out by audience members until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen. The following day, the news media including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott, a theatre major, now studies alongside her best friend Hallie and her new boyfriend Derek, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy, and Derek's best friend Mickey. Sidney receives prank calls but is oblivious to the recent killings until someone instructs her to watch the news. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive at the campus: officer Dewey Riley to help Sidney, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the case. Gale tries to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the murder of Sidney's mother. After Gale forcibly brings Sidney to Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale. Later that evening, Sidney goes to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface kills fellow student Cici. After all the partygoers leave, the killer then crashes the party and attempts to murder Sidney, though Derek intervenes. The killer injures Derek but Dewey and the police arrive, causing the killer to flee. The next morning, Gale discusses the case with the police. Upon realizing that Cici's real name is Casey, she concludes that the killer is a copycat who targets students who share the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims.

Background: Steven David \\"Steve\\" Levitt (born May 29, 1967) is an American economist known for his work in the field of crime, in particular on the link between legalized abortion and crime rates. Winner of the 2003 John Bates Clark Medal, he is currently the William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago, director of the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He was co-editor of the Journal of Political Economy published by the University of Chicago Press until December 2007. With journalist Stephen J. Dubner, he co-authored the best-selling book Freakonomics (2005) and its sequels SuperFreakonomics (2009) Context: On April 10, 2006, John Lott filed suit for defamation against Steven Levitt and HarperCollins Publishers over the book Freakonomics and against Levitt over a series of emails to retired economist John B. McCall. In the book Freakonomics, Levitt and coauthor Stephen J. Dubner claimed that the results of Lott's research in More Guns, Less Crime had not been replicated by other academics. In the emails to McCall, who had pointed to a number of papers in different academic publications that had replicated Lott's work, Levitt wrote that the work by authors supporting Lott in a special 2001 issue of the Journal of Law and Economics had not been peer reviewed, alleged that Lott had paid the University of Chicago Press to publish the papers, and that papers with results opposite of Lott's had been blocked from publication in that issue.  A federal judge found that Levitt's replication claim in Freakonomics was not defamation but found merit in Lott's complaint over the email claims.  Levitt settled the second defamation claim by admitting in a letter to John B. McCall that he himself was a peer reviewer in the 2001 issue of the Journal of Law and Economics, that Lott had not engaged in bribery (paying for extra costs of printing and postage for a conference issue is customary), and that he knew that \\"scholars with varying opinions\\" (including Levitt himself) had been invited to participate. The Chronicle of Higher Education characterized Levitt's letter as offering \\"a doozy of a concession.\\"  The dismissal of the first half of Lott's suit was unanimously upheld by The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on February 11, 2009. Question: Was that true?

'My desire to win is still the same and I look forward to. the opportunity to help this team. I am excited for this next chapter of my. career.' Mourinho allayed fears Drogba would sully his impeccable. legacy at Chelsea, insisting that the Ivorian is still one of the best strikers. in world football. 'He’s coming because he’s one of the best strikers in. Europe. I know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he’s not. protected by history or what he’s done for this club previously,' Mourinho. said. 'Looks like Drogba is back, loved our battles best big game player I can remember.' 'He is coming with the mentality to make more history.' Drogba's arrival gives Mourinho's side moe firepower up. front. Despite marquee signing Diego Costa's arrival, Fernando Torres and. Romelu Lukaku have both been linked with moves away from the club. Drogba's last kick for Chelsea in his initial eight-year. spell was the winning penalty to hand the west Londoners the Champions League. trophy. Return: Didier Drogba returns to west London after spells in China and Turkey. One in one out: Drogba returns to Chelsea after two years away, just as Frank Lampard heads off to New York. High: Drogba left on a high after helping Chelsea become the first London team to win the Champions League. The striker had already equalised in extra-time against. Bayern Munich at their Allianz Arena. Mourinho has brought Drogba back into the fold at a time. when two stalwarts have left the club in Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole. 2004/05:  Premier League and League Cup. 2005/06:  Premier League. 2006/07:  FA Cup and League Cup. 2008/09:  FA Cup. 2009/10:  Premier League and FA Cup. 2011/12:  FA Cup and Champions League. Lampard has completed a move to new MLS side New York City. while Cole has moved to Roma. Fellow Blues legend Petr Cech has also been linked with a. move away with Thibaut Courtois returning from loan at Atletico Madrid. It means only John Terry remains from the spine of. Mourinho's original Chelsea side, which picked up back-to-back Premier League. titles in 2005 and 2006. Appearances: 341. Goals: 151. Goals per game: 0.44. Major trophies: 10. Drogba signed for Galatasaray in January 2013 after a short. spell at Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua after bowing out at the Blues. He had an emotional return to Stamford Bridge with the. Turkish side in last season's Champions League last-16 before leaving the club. this summer. Now Drogba has sealed a move back to the club where he. became one of the most feared strikers in world football. Veteran: Drogba has over 100 caps for the Ivory Coast and made over 200 league appearances for Chelsea. With Didier Drogba, the man whose penalty secured a first Champions League win for Chelsea in the clubs history returning to Stamford Bridge, we look at other frontmen who have returned to their former clubs. Those who have had a second coming have often enjoyed a hero’s welcome upon their return, but, on the pitch, were they hits or misses? Ian Rush (Liverpool 1980-87 & 1988-96)Having joined Liverpool from Chester as a youngster for £300,000 in May 1980, a British transfer record for a teenager at the time, it quickly became obvious that Rush was a prolific goal scorer. After six seasons and 168 goals, Rush made a surprise move to Juventus for £3.2 million. Just seven goals came in twenty nine appearances in Italy and, after his unrest became clear, Rush returned as a hero to Anfield. In his first campaign back at Liverpool, still officially on loan from Juventus, he blasted 30 league goals and went on to hit the net another 142 times in all competitions for the Reds.  Verdict: Hit Robbie Keane (Tottenham 2002-08 & 2009-11)The Irish striker always had the potential to play at the top level. Having impressed at Coventry and Leeds via the briefest of stints at Inter Milan, Keane made his mark as a natural goal scorer at White Hart Lane. 80 league goals came in his first six years in North London. Keane ultimately could never rekindle that success after an unsuccessful move to Liverpool in 2008 and returned to Spurs the following February. Despite 15 goals in all competitions upon his return, Keane was never quite the same player.Verdict: Miss Mark Hughes (Manchester United 1980-86 & 1988-95)Hughes was on the score sheet 37 times in the league for Manchester United, having risen through the club’s academy ranks. His form could not be replicated once he left for Barcelona and he suffered similar problems at Bayern Munich, to whom he was then loaned. Hughes returned to Old Trafford and won the PFA Player of the Year Award in his first season back in England (1988/89). Under the stewardship of Sir Alex Ferguson, he went on to score over 100 more goals for the club and cemented himself in its rich history.Verdict: Hit  Teddy Sheringham (Tottenham 1992-97 & 2001-03)Although Sheringham’s great trophy-winning days came at Manchester United between 1997 and 2001, he will always be remembered as a club legend by Spurs fans and players. He scored 99 goals in his first six years wearing the white of Tottenham and, after an extremely successful spell at Old Trafford, he returned to White Hart Lane to lift Tottenham fans from their seats another 26 times. He has since been inducted into their Hall of Fame.Verdict: Hit. Peter Crouch (Tottenham 1998-2000 & 2009-11)Another player to return to Tottenham was the familiar figure of Peter Crouch. He never played senior football for Spurs as a youth player, but returned over ten years later, for a fee reported to be around £9 million. Crouch had a mixed career at Spurs second time around, scoring 24 goals but also suffering two separate, three month long barren spells in front of goal. His hero status gained by scoring the winner against Manchester City in 2010, securing Spurs Champions League football was tarnished when he scored an own goal against the same opposition the following year. Spurs missed out on joining Europe’s elite on that occasion, with City qualifying.Verdict: Miss Thierry Henry (Arsenal 1999-2007 & 2012)The briefest of returns to Arsenal for the Frenchman. The fans wouldn’t have been bothered had he not scored at all after his 226 goals before he moved to Barcelona in 2007. Instead, the prolific striker bagged the winner on his second ‘debut.’ Arsenal later unveiled a statue for Henry, who emotionally accepted the gesture outside the Emirates Stadium, with the club colours draped around his neck.Verdict: Hit.

The recall of peanut products is the latest in a series of increasingly severe food contamination scares involving tomatoes, spinach, cantaloupes and other foods.    TheGeorgiaplant, which is closed, packed peanut butter in bulk ranging from 5 to 1,700 pounds, much of which was shipped to institutions. Many school districts have pulled peanut butter from menus, with some substituting more commonly recognized supermarket brands. New York City school officials said they had not bought any peanut butter or products with ingredients that originated at theGeorgiaplant.    An F.D.A. inspection team that visited the plant on Jan. 9 discovered that on 12 occasions in 2007 and 2008 tests conducted by the company found salmonella contamination in its products but that it shipped the contaminated products to customers after a retest found no contamination and did nothing to clean the plant.

Detective Seo Tae-yoon is sent from Seoul to assist them; their methods clash and he is unable to convince them they are dealing with a serial killer until his predictions of another murder come true. He realizes that the killer waits until a rainy night, and only kills women wearing red. A female police officer realizes that a local radio station is always requested to play a particular song during the nights the murders are committed.While Seo investigates and tries to piece together the clues, Park and his men beat confessions out of a local man found masturbating at the scene of one crime, and a mentally retarded boy whom they threaten to kill, going so far as to make him dig his own grave. Seo clears both of those suspects and follows a trail of clues to a factory worker who had only moved to the area a short time before the first murder. The detectives are unable to pin anything on him; when they realize that the retarded boy witnessed one of the crimes and try to speak to him, they frighten him so badly that he runs in front of an oncoming train and is killed.Finally, when yet another murder is committed and DNA evidence sent for processing in the United States comes back inconclusive, Seo's frustrations flow over and he snaps. He flies into a rage and roughs up the factory worker; only Park stops Seo from shooting the suspect.It's 2003 now and Park - now a businessman with a family - visits a crime scene - the first one, at a drain - from the case.

Write a title for this article: Mark Sanchez can lose the cap and the clipboard for his start against Jacksonville on Sunday. “The biggest thing that I kept coming back to was who gives us the best opportunity to win,” Ryan said. “When I kept coming back to that, I believe the correct answer is Mark Sanchez.” Ryan solicited input from numerous people before making the decision, and he admitted there were dissenting voices. Ultimately, Ryan said it was his call and he did not receive any pressure from the Jets’ owner, Woody Johnson. Sanchez bottomed out last Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals, throwing three interceptions in the first half. Ryan finally satisfied booing fans at MetLife Stadium when he replaced the ineffective Sanchez with Greg McElroy late in the third quarter. In his N.F.L. debut, McElroy completed 5 of 7 passes for 29 yards and a touchdown in the Jets’ 7-6 win. The performance led to speculation that McElroy, the 2011 seventh-round pick out of Alabama, would unseat Sanchez. Ryan did little to extinguish those thoughts by mulling his options for 48 hours. Ryan informed the quarterbacks of the decision in a 10-minute meeting Wednesday morning that included the offensive coordinator, Tony Sparano, and the quarterbacks coach, Matt Cavanaugh. “I wanted to make sure that it wasn’t just a flying-off-the-handle move or something you would do haphazardly,” said Ryan, who has steadfastly defended Sanchez, especially this season, despite his increasingly poor play. “I wanted to make sure I was thorough with it. I know it’s a huge decision, but it’s one I feel great about.” Ryan said the team’s financial commitment to Sanchez had “absolutely zero” impact on the decision. Sanchez signed a three-year contract extension in March that guarantees him 8.25 million next season. “That’s the last thing on my mind,” Sanchez said. “I don’t know. Ask the coaches and management. That’s not my job.” McElroy took the same amount of reps as usual at Wednesday’s practice, which meant most of his time was spent with the scout team. He had no expectation that he would be named the starter and did not object to the decision. “Coach Ryan has been put in charge to make those decisions and to put the best player on the field that he thinks gives the team the best chance of being successful,” McElroy said. “That person is Mark and I obviously completely understand that.” The schedule gave Sanchez a reprieve with a road game against the Jacksonville Jaguars (2-10). EverBank Field figures to be a far more forgiving environment than MetLife Stadium. “It’s kind of similar to a road game,” Sanchez said of the home crowd’s reception last week. Jaguars fans will probably be disappointed that Sanchez received the start, but not because they are hoping to see McElroy. Instead, they will be clamoring for the hometown hero Tim Tebow, who had been the Jets’ backup all season until sustaining two broken ribs on Nov. 11. Tebow did not play in Week 12 against the New England Patriots and was inactive for the first time this season against the Cardinals. Ryan said Tebow will be the No. 2 quarterback Sunday if he’s “completely healthy,” a determination that will not be made until later in the week. X-rays taken last Sunday revealed some improvement for Tebow. “Obviously we’re all competitors, we all want to play,” Tebow said. “To say that I wouldn’t want to be in there playing, that’s not the truth. I would love to go in there and compete and help this team win football games.” Ryan conceded that Sanchez would be on a short leash if he struggled against the Jaguars. In Sanchez’s rookie season, Ryan devised a “red, yellow, green” system to help Sanchez’s decision making. The Jets (5-7) currently are in red — the most cautious phase — but that does not mean they are going to shy from throwing the ball. Ryan simply wants Sanchez to make better decisions and to avoid the unforced errors that have contributed to his 18 turnovers. Sanchez considered the benching a message and said it had been received. He will not be looking over his shoulder on Sunday. “I’ll be fine,” Sanchez said. “I know how to play better. Now it’s time to go prove it.” Despite the first benching he could remember since “maybe in basketball in fifth grade,” Sanchez’s confidence has not wavered. “I knew at some point before I died I’d start at quarterback again,” Sanchez said. “I’m just glad it’s this week.” Title:","output":"Mark Sanchez Back as Starting Quarterback: Jets' Coach Ryan Makes the Call Against Jacksonville"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr. Patel said that Mr. Tomlinson died because his heart stopped working (a heart attack) after he was pushed. Unfortunately, when Dr. Patel was trying to figure out why Mr. Tomlinson died, he didn't do a very good job.

They have a beginning, a middle, and an end-- with ads thrown in every three or four minutes. The ads are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard appears outside the bus window.\\"Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.\\"\\"Drink Good'n Wet Root Beer.\\"\\"Fill up with Pacific Gas.\\" Only if you sleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, are you spared the unending cry of \\"You Need It! Buy It Now!\\" The beginning of the ride is comfortable and somewhat exciting, even if you've traveled that way before. Usually some things have changed--new houses, new buildings, sometimes even a new road. The bus driver has a style of driving and it's fun to try to figure it out the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly daring, the ride can be as exciting as a suspense  story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left-hand lane?After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know it will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement in that. The seat, of course, has become harder as the hours have passed. By now you've sat with your legs crossed, with your hands in your lap, with your hands on the arm rests--even with your hands crossed behind your head. The end comes just at the right time.

If \\"Workers fix train tracks.\\", can we conclude \\"People repair tracks.\\"?","output":"Yes, we can fairly conclude that \\"People repair tracks.\\" when we know that \\"Workers fix train tracks.\\" Let's break it down and analyze the statement to have a deeper understanding. The original statement, \\"Workers fix train tracks,\\" consists of three main components: 1. Workers: This term refers to individuals who are employed to perform tasks and duties within a specific context. In this case, these individuals are employed to maintain and repair train tracks, which implies that they are skilled and knowledgeable in this area. 2. Fix: The term 'fix' implies correcting, repairing, or restoring something to its original functional state. In this scenario, it pertains to performing the necessary maintenance and repairs to ensure that train tracks continue to function correctly. 3. Train tracks: Train tracks are the rails that allow trains to operate smoothly. These consist of steel rails that are fastened to sleepers (also known as ties) and are underlain by ballast, which helps distribute the load and provide stability. Train tracks are an essential element of a railway network and must be maintained to ensure the safe and efficient operation of trains. Now, when we say, \\"People repair tracks,\\" we are making a general statement that encompasses the following: 1. People: This term is a broader way to refer to individuals who may be involved in repairing tracks. While \\"workers\\" specifically implies that they are employed to do the task, the term \\"people\\" may include workers, volunteers, or other individuals who are part of the track repair and maintenance process. The term \\"people\\" here might not only refer to those who directly fix the tracks but also those who indirectly contribute to the process such as supervisors, engineers, or even track inspectors. 2. Repair: Similar to 'fix,' the term 'repair' denotes restoring something to its original functioning state. In this context, it involves the process of ensuring that train tracks are properly maintained, and any faults or wear are corrected so that trains can operate safely and effectively. 3. Tracks: In this case, we're still discussing train tracks. However, the word \\"tracks\\" may also be interpreted to encompass other types of tracks, such as tram tracks or even tracks for smaller rail-related vehicles. These tracks, like train tracks, also require maintenance and repair to keep their respective transportation systems operational. In conclusion, the statement \\"Workers fix train tracks\\" implies that there are individuals employed to maintain and repair train tracks. By saying \\"People repair tracks,\\" we can generalize the initial statement and include a broader range of individuals who might be involved in the repair and maintenance process of not just train tracks, but also other types of tracks related to rail transportation. Therefore, we can indeed conclude that \\"People repair tracks\\" when we know that \\"Workers fix train tracks.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options are:  (A). applaud Quinn.  (B). want a better show.  (C). praise Quinn.","output":"The audience at the comedy club that witnessed Quinn's terrible performance where he was booed off the stage would most likely have a mix of reactions. Most members of the audience would not applaud or praise Quinn due to the unsatisfactory performance, so options (A) and (C) would be improbable outcomes. Instead, they are more likely to feel disappointed and want a better show. Therefore, option (B) seems to be the most accurate representation of their response. When attending a comedy club, the audience expects a night of entertainment and laughter. They wish to indulge in engaging and light-hearted performances to escape their daily stresses and have a good time. When a comedian does not meet those expectations, the disappointment can prompt varying responses from audience members. Some guests may express their displeasure by booing the performer, demanding a better show or simply not laughing. In Quinn's case, being booed off the stage demonstrates the audience's discontent with his performance and reflects their desire for an improved show. They may hope for subsequent acts to save the evening and deliver the entertainment they were seeking. Moreover, witnessing a poor performance might create a buzz among audience members, leading to conversations about the night's events and discussing the lackluster act. This kind of negative word-of-mouth can potentially harm the comedian's reputation and bookings in the future. In summary, after witnessing Quinn being booed off the stage during a terrible performance, the audience will likely be disappointed and want a better show. They may express their disapproval with various reactions like booing, not laughing, or initiating conversations about the incident. Subsequently, they would want a more entertaining act to rectify the overall experience of their visit to the comedy club."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While driving his Dual-Ghia from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, lecherous, heavy-drinking pop singer Dino is forced to detour through Climax, Nevada. There he meets the amateur songwriting team of Barney Millsap, a gas station attendant, and piano teacher Orville J. Spooner, a man easily given to jealousy. Hoping to interest Dino in their songs, Barney disables the \\"Italian\\" sports car and tells Dino he will need to remain in town until new parts arrive from Milan. (Dual-Ghia was actually an American marque, mating a Dodge frame, drivetrain, and engine with Italian coachwork.) Orville invites Dino to stay with him and wife Zelda, but becomes concerned when he learns the singer needs to have sex every night to avoid awakening with a headache. Anxious to accommodate Dino but safeguard his marriage, Orville provokes an argument with his wife that leads to Zelda fleeing in tears. He and Barney then arrange for Polly the Pistol, a waitress and prostitute at a saloon on the edge of town called the Belly Button, to pose as Orville's wife and satisfy Dino. That evening after the three have dinner, Orville plays his tunes for Dino on the piano and Polly requests a particular song. It is one she knows he wrote for his wife when trying to persuade her to marry him. Doing so, Orville gets lost in emotion, as does Polly, who has fallen a little for the dream of a domestic life that she doesn't have. Under the influence of wine and song, Orville starts thinking of Polly as his wife and tosses Dino out. He then spends the night with Polly.

In the text, it is mentioned that \\"Barney Millsap, a gas station attendant\\" is the one who disables the sports car in order to persuade Dino to stay in town and show interest in his and Orville's songs.

Christine recommended a snail killing pellet because","output":"it had proven to be effective in the past and was a safe and quick solution for the problem. These snail killing pellets are specifically designed to control snail populations and protect plants and landscaping from damage caused by these pests. The active ingredient in the pellets is a chemical called metaldehyde, which targets the snail's nervous system, eventually causing paralysis and death. This pesticide is not only highly efficient in eliminating snails but also poses minimal risks to other animals and the environment when used appropriately.  Christine went on to explain the benefits and precautions of using snail killing pellets to Jessica in greater detail. One of the main benefits of these pellets is that they are easy to apply and maintain. A small handful of pellets can cover a significant area in the garden or yard, and they work effectively in damp and humid conditions, often when snails are most active. The pellets can be spread around the base of plants the snails prefer to feed on, creating a barrier that deters them from access and helps prevent further damage. Additionally, these pellets work relatively quickly, ensuring that snail populations can be brought under control in a short period. However, Christine reminded Jessica that there were essential precautions to take when using snail killing pellets. Firstly, it is imperative to ensure that pets and children don't come into contact with the pellets, as they may contain harmful substances that can cause health issues if ingested. To mitigate this risk, pellets should be kept out of reach and used according to the specified instructions on the product packaging. Another concern is the potential for the toxins to accumulate in the food chain. When a poisoned snail dies, and another animal such as a bird or a small mammal comes to feed on it, there is a chance that the toxins could make their way up the food chain. This is why it's crucial to monitor and remove any dead snails in a timely fashion manually. Moreover, choosing a brand of pellets that use lower concentrations of active ingredients or an alternative like iron phosphate-based products, which are more eco-friendly and equally effective, would be a responsible choice. Lastly, it's essential to keep in mind that not all snails and slugs are garden pests; some actually help maintain a healthy ecosystem. So, it's best to target areas with high infestations and use pellets in moderation to avoid disrupting the balance of the garden. With these points in mind, Jessica could make an informed decision about using snail killing pellets for her yard. Following Christine's advice and ensuring she takes the proper precautions would help her protect her prized plants, enhance the health and appearance of her garden, while also minimizing potential harm to other wildlife and the environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's dissect both statements to clarify the situation. The Premise: \\"Person holds onto tightropes in a snowy landscape.\\" This statement presents a scenario but does not provide explicit information about what the person is doing with the tightropes other than holding onto them. The individual could be performing an array of actions. They could be walking on it, adjusting it, steadying themselves against it, preparing to make a move, or merely examining it. The environmental detail of a snowy landscape provides a context that invites various possibilities considering the challenging condition but gives no specific action to the person's interaction with the rope.

If the premise stated, for instance, \\"The person holds onto tightropes in a snowy landscape, with a knife in their other hand, appearing to saw at the rope\\", then the hypothesis would be better supported. In its current state, we cannot definitively conclude that the person is cutting the rope based on the premise provided, as it does not explicitly or implicitly suggest such an action.  A conclusion based on some level of assumption can often lead to misunderstandings or crosstalk. Calibration of the narrative in a way that it holistically supports the hypothesis requires an alignment of details in both premise and hypothesis. For such, to conclude that the person is cutting the rope, we need more specific details suggesting such an action in the scenario mentioned. Hence, it is important to present clear, unambiguous statements, especially in the premise, to establish a reliable foundation for the hypothesis or conclusion. So, unless further detail is provided, the hypothesis remains unproven, despite the premise being true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

At the end , Princess Minnie entitles Mickey , Donald and Goofy Royal Musketeers .","output":"To determine if these two sentences mean the same thing, I will break down each sentence and analyze the keywords. Sentence 1: - \\"At the end\\": This is a point in time, indicating that the action takes place at the conclusion of a story or event. - \\"Princess Minnie\\": The character who is performing the action. - \\"dubs\\": This verb means to confer a knighthood or title upon someone in a ceremonial manner. - \\"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\\": The recipients of the title. - \\"royal musketeers\\": The title being conferred upon the recipients. Sentence 2: - \\"At the end\\" : This phrase has the same meaning as in the first sentence. - \\"Princess Minnie\\" : The character is also the same as in the first sentence. - \\"entitles\\": This verb means to give someone a legal right or claim to something, or to designate someone for a specific role or title. - \\"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\\": Same recipients as in the first sentence. - \\"Royal Musketeers\\": The same title as in the first sentence, with the only difference being a change in capitalization.

The statement \\"A group of tourist taking pictures, while looking at scenery on top of a mountain.\\" only provides us with information about their actions (taking pictures and looking at the scenery), but it does not expressly indicate their emotional state or the motivation behind those actions.

They could primarily be capturing memories, appreciating the view, or attempting to document their trip for various reasons like sharing it on social media or with friends and family back home. Additionally, it's important to consider that individuals within a group may have different motivations and emotions. Some of the tourists might indeed be in awe of the mountain, while others may simply be interested in the activity of hiking or photography, or following the group's agenda without being particularly emotionally affected by the mountain itself.

Premise: \\"Quick follow them.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"It is important that you follow them.\\" true?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"It is important that you follow them\\" is true, we need to analyze the context and implications of the premise \\"Quick, follow them.\\" In doing so, we'll look at the possible intentions, situations, and challenges for the characters involved in this situation. The premise suggests urgency, implied by the use of the word \\"Quick.\\" This urgency is the primary indicator that following the subject(s) is important. There could be many reasons for the urgency, which we will explore below. 1. An immediate threat or opportunity: In cases where the subject(s) may present a danger or opportunity for those involved in the scenario, it becomes important to follow them closely to prevent harm or make the best of the situation. For example, the subject(s) may have vital information necessary for a decision-making process, and losing track of them could lead to adverse consequences. This lends credence to the hypothesis that following them is important. 2. Time-sensitive information or action: If the subject(s) are involved in an activity that requires prompt intervention or information extraction, the importance of following them is heightened. For instance, they may be fleeing the scene of a crime, carrying crucial evidence, or engaged in activities that require surveillance, such as participating in illegal transactions. In these cases, losing track of the subject(s) could mean losing valuable insight, potentially allowing the perpetuation of criminal activity or escape from justice. 3. Preventing harm or benefiting others: If following the subject(s) has the potential to prevent harm or provide benefits to others, then the hypothesis is further supported. For example, the subject(s) may have just saved someone from a dangerous situation and require additional assistance or resources. Failing to follow them could result in harm to the rescued individual or, on the contrary, provide a chance for grateful acknowledgment and potential reciprocation. 4. Maintaining group cohesion: If the subject(s) are part of a team or group working on a cohesive mission or task, following them becomes important to ensure group efficiency and collaboration. It's possible that the speaker perceives the importance of sticking together and is emphasizing this through their urgent instruction. 5. Personal reasons: The importance of following the subject(s) might be attached to personal relationships, attachment, or commitment, which lends support to the hypothesis. Should the speaker have emotional connections with the subject(s) or share a compelling consequence that involves others, then it becomes important to follow the subject(s) closely. Taking the aforementioned reasons into account, it's clear that the premise \\"Quick, follow them\\" likely implies a certain level of importance in following the subject(s). However, it's essential to consider the individual context and circumstances to determine whether the hypothesis \\"It is important that you follow them\\" is indeed true or false. In most scenarios, though, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the urgency and implications of the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: For many years, I was convinced that my suffering was due to my size. I believed that when the weight disappeared, it would take old wounds, hurts and rejections with it. Many weight-conscious people also mistakenly believe that changing our bodies will fix _ . Perhaps our mistake is believing that being thin equals being loved, being special, and being cherished. We fantasize   about what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal .We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there. But we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off. Next time, being thin will finally fulfill its promise of everlasting happiness, self-worth, and, of course, love. It took me a long time to realize that there was something more for me to learn about beauty. Beauty standards vary with culture. In Samoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds. More importantly, if it's happiness that we want, why not put our energy there rather than on the size of our body? Why not look inside? Many of us strive hard to change our body, but in vain. We have to find a way to live comfortably inside our body and make friends with and cherish ourselves. When we change our attitudes towards ourselves, the whole world changes.

One if his first recording projects was working on the track \\"Planet Rock\\" by Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force in 1982. Context_2 : The Hunger is an industrial rock band from Houston, Texas formed by brothers Jeff and Thomas Wilson along with Brian Albritton. During the initial year of putting the band together and working on new material the band wrote and independently released the single, \\"Shock\\" in 1991 which rose to the top of the dance charts. Industrial dance music ruled the charts in Europe along with strong ties to Chicago, Wax Trax Records, and Houston. Subsequent releases of \\"Cut the Skin\\" and \\"Shoot to Kill\\" gained national exposure on the dance charts and club scene. \\"Never Again\\" was self-released as a radio single and quickly rose to the top of Houston Radio Station's 93Q and 96.5 attracting the attention of independent record label Alpha International. Stephen Bogle produced the single of \\"Never Again\\". The band wrote and produced the album \\"Leave Me Alone\\" but due to the bankruptcy of Alpha International the record sat idle. It was released but there were no marketing efforts behind it. After the release of the album, the band sought out drummer Max Schuldberg and they played their first concert as a foursome opening for Peter Murphy at Southern Star Amphitheater. They played concerts in Texas as a foursome for two years. Along with the three founders and newest member Max Schuldberg, the band added producer Stephen Bogle as guitarist to complete the line up. The band recorded and produced \\"Grip\\" under their own start up label, Gut Records. \\"Grip\\" went on to sell 15,000 units with the help of a crafty rework of Bad Company's \\"Feel like Makin Love\\". Universal Records, at the time a brand new start up label, heard of the success of \\"Grip\\" and signed the band as their second artist ever. \\"Devil Thumbs a Ride\\", the 3rd album, had already been recorded and mastered and was about to be manufactured for another self-release when Universal stepped in to sign the band and release the album as-is. The Hunger had a hit song in 1996, \\"Vanishing Cream\\", from the \\"Devil Thumbs a Ride\\" CD, which received heavy airplay on rock stations and reached No. 4 on the Mainstream Rock charts. After two years of constant touring, the band finally stopped to record their second release with Universal Records, \\"Cinematic Superthug\\". After only moderate success with the single, \\"Moderation\\", the band asked to be and was granted a release from their contract from Universal Records. Two songs, \\"Shoot to Kill\\", also from \\"Devil Thumbs a Ride\\", and \\"If\\", from \\"Grip\\", reached No. 42 on Billboard's Dance/Club Play chart. The band has released six albums: two on Universal Records and four on independent labels. Former original drummer (1991-2003) Max Schuldberg (voted 2002's Best Drummer by the Houston Press Music Awards) parted with the band after the five albums in 2003 and moved to Los Angeles. Former guitarist and two time Grammy Award nominee (remixer, for his work with D.J. Cubanito) Stephen Bogle now Produces artists in the Metal, Electronic, and Pop genres. In late 2005 Stephen Bogle parted ways with the band, and Tim Huston was quickly picked up. With having only a few practices with the band they headed on tour with Ten Years. Tim Huston Stayed with the band from late '05 til 2013. \\"The lifestyle was just getting to overwhelming for me to handle\\". \\"If I would have stayed, who knows what would have happened to me. There was just no off button\\". In 2013, guitarist Raf Rivera joined the lineup, and the band is currently in the process of recording their first new material in over 8 years. Context_3 : \\"Vision of Love\\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey. It served as Carey's debut single, the first from her eponymous debut album. Written by Carey and Ben Margulies, \\"Vision of Love\\" was released on May 15, 1990, by Columbia Records. After being featured on Carey's demo tape for Columbia, the song was re-sung and produced by Rhett Lawrence and Narada Michael Walden. \\"Vision of Love\\" features a slow-dance theme tempo and backing vocals sung by Carey herself, and introduces her usage of the whistle register. Lyrically, the song describes a past and present relationship with a lover. Carey describes the \\"vision of love\\" she dreamed of, as well as the present love she feels for him. Context_4 : The Roman de la Rose (] ; \\"Romance of the Rose\\"), is a medieval French poem styled as an allegorical dream vision. It is a notable instance of courtly literature. The work's stated purpose is to both entertain and to teach others about the Art of Love. At various times in the poem, the \\"Rose\\" of the title is seen as the name of the lady, and as a symbol of female sexuality in general. Likewise, the other characters' names function both as regular names and as abstractions illustrating the various factors that are involved in a love affair.

Una Rosa Blu reached a highest position of third place on the Billboard Latin Pop Albums, within a few weeks of its release. In Spain it was one of the Top 100 best selling albums in 2009. Context_6 : Tribute Records (Ben-Jamin' Universal Music) is an American gospel music record label established in 1990. The label was co-founded by jazz musician and former pro basketball player Ben Tankard and George King. King owned Nashville based Diadem Music Group which produced Contemporary Christian music. Diadem's signature artist Bob Carlisle is best known for his hit song \\"Butterfly Kisses\\". Tribute became the urban contemporary gospel (black gospel) division of Diadem and home to several gospel music stars, most notably Tankard (a keyboardist whose solo albums were instrumental releases), Yolanda Adams, Twinkie Clark of The Clark Sisters and others. Tankard was executive producer and music producer on most of the early Tribute releases and his vision was to develop artists and pioneer a new smooth genre of music he coined as \\"gospeljazz\\". He featured Yolanda Adam's jazzy vocals on the album and concept video single \\" You Bring Out The Best In Me \\" on his 1994 release \\"Play Me In Your Key\\". The jazzy collaborations of Tankard and Adams produced major crossover success and brought the name of Tribute Records to the forefront. Office Depot produced a gospel style \\" Taking Care Of Business \\" commercial national ad campaign that was centered on Tribute Records, Tankard, and Adams and ran from 1994-1996.

Many of his stories are built on characters and locations created by Carl Barks, including the story that brought him to fame as a modern Disney artist – the Harvey Award-nominated comic, \\"The Son of the Sun\\". Context_8 : Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1969 or 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. In 1990, she rose to fame with the release of \\"Vision of Love\\" from her eponymous debut album. The album produced four chart-topping singles in the US and began what would become a string of commercially successful albums which solidified the singer as Columbia Records' highest selling act. Carey and Boyz II Men spent a record sixteen weeks atop the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 in 1995–1996 with \\"One Sweet Day,\\" which remains the longest-running number-one song in US chart history. Following a contentious divorce from Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and traversed towards hip hop with the release of \\"Butterfly\\" (1997). In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards and subsequently named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000. Context_9 : Rosa kordesii, or Rosa\\" × \\"kordesii is a type of rose that arose naturally from hybridization followed by chromosome doubling. A hybrid between \\"R. rugosa\\" and \\"R. wichurana\\" was created called \\"Rosa\\" 'Max Graf', but it was diploid and nearly sterile, producing flowers but no fruit. This rose produced a few viable seeds as a result of self-pollination, and the seedlings that resulted were tetraploid instead of diploid, i.e., the chromosomes of both pollen and egg cells had been naturally duplicated. The tetraploid seedlings are amphidiploids. A selection with double deep pink flowers and repeat bloom, also called 'K01 AgCan' was released by W. Kordes' Söhne in 1951.

Information:  - Forage fish, also called prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.  - Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , / trtkeli / is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second - generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first - cross ) triticales . As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop . Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale - based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) . The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself . The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world . The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale . Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time . The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application . The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals . The protein content is...  - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as more fully herbivorous animals.  - Rice is the seed of the grass species \\"Oryza sativa\\" (Asian rice) or \\"Oryza glaberrima\\" (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China.  - Silage is fermented, high-moisture stored fodder which can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals) or used as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digesters. It is fermented and stored in a process called \\"ensilage\\", \\"ensiling\\" or \\"silaging\\", and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type (\\"oatlage\\" for oats, \\"haylage\\" for alfalfa  but see below for the different British use of the term \\"haylage\\").  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Rye (\\"Secale cereale\\") is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus \\"Hordeum\\") and wheat (\\"Triticum\\"). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats.  - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera found in this tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat \\"Triticum\\" species. Seed storage proteins in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances.  - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems.  - The chicken (\\"Gallus gallus domesticus\\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.  - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.  - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates.  - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals.  - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin.  - There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing.  - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\"  a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany.  - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\".  - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).  - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century.  - Animal feed is food given to domestic animals in the course of animal husbandry. There are two basic types, \\"fodder\\" and \\"forage\\". Used alone, the word \\"feed\\" more often refers to fodder.  - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe.  - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.  - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles.  - The Levant (Arabic:  \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\".  - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.  - Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.

The unit will have the power to enforce existing trade laws, file international complaints, and even impose sanctions on countries found to be violating fair trade practices. President Obama emphasized the importance of this unit as a tool for promoting fairness and protecting American businesses and jobs. He also urged Congress to do its part in supporting the American economy by closing tax loopholes that benefit companies that outsource jobs and rewarding those that bring jobs back to the US. \\"It's time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas and start rewarding businesses that create jobs right here in America,\\" the president said. The State of the Union address highlighted the administration's commitment to combating unfair trade practices and prioritizing domestic concerns such as job creation. It remains to be seen how effective the new trade enforcement unit will be in achieving these goals, but President Obama has made it clear that his administration will take a tougher stance on countries, like China, who engage in unfair trade practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are some more myths: false ideas about being fat and doing weight as they get older, while others I'll never lose weightI come from a fat family Wrong! While we can't change the body type we are bom with, we can't blame our genes for making us fat.

C) A diary of exercise can prevent people from becoming fat. D) It is the consequence of people's unbalanced lifestyle.","output":"The author presents a few myths and misconceptions surrounding exercise and weight gain. According to the author, being fat is not solely due to family genes or a slow metabolism. The main reason is that people with weight issues often share the same habits of eating too much and exercising too little. Consequently, the author believes that being fat is a consequence of an individual's unbalanced lifestyle (D). To address some of the discussed myths: 1. \\"I come from a fat family\\" - While there may be a genetic predisposition to be of a certain body type, the author emphasizes that poor lifestyle choices, such as overeating and lack of exercise, significantly contribute to weight gain. 2. \\"I am fat because I burn calories slowly\\" - The author refutes this claim by explaining that weight gain is not caused by a slow metabolism. While fat people may consume more energy than slim people, the key issue is that they often fail to accurately acknowledge how much they eat. 3. \\"Exercise is boring\\" - The author states that boredom can be avoided by developing a balanced and varied exercise program, including trying new activities and incorporating different challenges to make exercise more engaging. 4. \\"No pain, no gain\\" - Pain is not a necessary aspect of exercise and could indicate potential harm to the body. Mild discomfort might be experienced during the initial stages of exercise, but persistent pain should be taken seriously and requires proper medical attention. In conclusion, the author feels that being fat is a result of an unbalanced lifestyle consisting of excessive food intake and insufficient physical activity (D).

Keep in mind that working with glass can be dangerous, so always wear safety gloves and goggles before starting the task. Step 1: Assess the damage Examine the window frame to determine the exact problem. It could be broken glass, damaged or rotten wooden frame, loose joints, or broken locks and handles. Step 2: Gather the necessary tools and materials Based on the damage assessment, gather the tools and materials needed to perform the repair. Common repair tools include the following: - Safety gloves and goggles - Tape measure - Hammer and nails - Screwdriver and screws - Putty knife or chisel - Wood filler or epoxy (if repairing wood) - Sandpaper - Paint or wood preservative (if necessary) - Replacement glass (if required) - Glass cutter (if needed) - Glazing points - Glazing putty or caulk Step 3: Remove the broken glass (if applicable) If the glass is damaged, you will need to replace it. Carefully remove any broken glass by gently tapping it with a hammer to break it into smaller pieces. Use a putty knife to remove the glazing putty holding the glass in place and remove any old glazing points as well. Be sure to dispose of the glass safely in a designated container. Step 4: Repair the frame If the window frame is damaged, you will need to repair it. For a wooden frame, remove any loose or rotten wood and fill the holes with wood filler or epoxy. Once the filler has dried, sand the surface to make it smooth and even with the rest of the frame. Step 5: Install the new glass (if applicable) Measure the opening in the frame and have a new glass panel cut to size. You can use a glass cutter to cut the glass yourself or have a professional do it. Place the new glass panel into the frame and secure it using glazing points. Space the glazing points evenly along the edges of the glass. Step 6: Apply glazing putty or caulk Use a putty knife to apply a layer of glazing putty or caulk around the edges of the glass, pressing it firmly against the window frame. This will help secure the glass and provide a weatherproof seal. Step 7: Paint or treat the frame (if necessary) If the repaired frame needs painting or applying a wood preservative, do so once the glazing putty or caulk has dried according to the manufacturer's instructions. This will protect the frame from further damage and ensure a clean, finished look. Step 8: Reassemble and check Reinstall any hardware that was removed, such as locks and handles. Check the window's operation to ensure it opens and closes smoothly and securely. By following these steps, you can successfully repair a glass window frame and restore its functionality and appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information:  - Johan August Strindberg (22 January 1849  14 May 1912) was a Swedish playwright, novelist, poet, essayist and painter. A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg's career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over 60 plays and more than 30 works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics. A bold experimenter and iconoclast throughout, he explored a wide range of dramatic methods and purposes, from naturalistic tragedy, monodrama, and history plays, to his anticipations of expressionist and surrealist dramatic techniques. From his earliest work, Strindberg developed innovative forms of dramatic action, language, and visual composition. He is considered the \\"father\\" of modern Swedish literature and his \\"The Red Room\\" (1879) has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel.  - The Protestant Reformation, often referred to simply as the Reformation (from Latin \\"reformatio\\", \\"restoration, renewal\\"), was a schism from the Roman Catholic Church initiated by Martin Luther and continued by John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and other early Protestant Reformers in 16th century Europe. Timing most commonly used for this period is from 1517 (the Ninety-five Theses are published by Martin Luther) to 1648 (Peace of Westphalia ends the Thirty Years' War).  - Swedish literature refers to literature written in the Swedish language or by writers from Sweden.  - Master Olof ( Swedish : Mäster Olof ) is a historical drama in five acts by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg . The story is about the reformer Olaus Petri 's struggle against the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century . First written in 1872 , Strindberg rewrote it many times in both prose and verse . Ludvig Josephson ( the new artistic director of Stockholm 's New Theatre ) agreed to stage Master Olof , eventually opting for the prose version -- the five - hour - long première opened on 30 December 1881 under the direction of August Lindberg to favourable reviews . This production represented Strindberg 's breakthrough in the theatre .  - Olof Persson, sometimes Petersson (January 6, 1493  April 19, 1552), better known under the Latin form of his name, Olaus Petri (or less commonly, Olavus Petri), was a clergyman, writer, judge and major contributor to the Protestant Reformation in Sweden. His brother, Laurentius Petri (Lars Persson), became the first Evangelical Lutheran Archbishop of Sweden.  - Laurentius Petri Nericius (1499  27 October 1573) was a Swedish clergyman and the first Evangelical Lutheran Archbishop of Sweden. He and his brother Olaus Petri are, together with the King Gustav Vasa, regarded as the main Lutheran reformers of Sweden. They are commemorated by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on April 19.    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'country of origin' with the subject 'master olof'.  Choices: - europe  - sweden A:","output":"The object entity that exhibits the relation 'country of origin' with the subject 'Master Olof' is Sweden.

Answer: In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"The answer provides a brief introduction to the creators of the first rabies vaccine. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response, here is an expanded answer: The first successful rabies vaccine was developed by Louis Pasteur, a renowned French chemist and microbiologist, and Pierre Paul Émile Roux, a French physician, bacteriologist, and immunologist. Together, they made significant advancements in the field of immunization and public health. Louis Pasteur is best known for his development of the pasteurization process, which involves heating liquids to a specific temperature for a certain period to kill harmful bacteria. Concurrently, he discovered that microorganisms cause many diseases, and he played a pivotal role in developing the germ theory of disease. During the 1870s and 1880s, Pasteur shifted his attention to the study of infectious diseases, specifically anthrax and rabies. Rabies is a viral disease that affects the nervous system and is typically transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected animal, such as a dog or a bat. At that time, rabies was a serious public health issue that induced fear and panic amongst the masses.  In 1881, Pasteur, along with Roux, began researching an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for rabies. They used a technique called serial passage, which involved transferring live virus through different animal hosts. The virus was extracted from the spinal cords of infected rabbits, allowed to dry for several days to weaken its virulence, and then injected into healthy animals. Upon completing the serial passage, the rabid animal tissue was less potent, allowing it to be used as a vaccine. On July 6, 1885, after a series of successful experiments on animals, Pasteur and Roux tested the first-ever rabies vaccine on a human. The boy, named Joseph Meister, had been bitten by a rabid dog, and the vaccine was administered to him at the risk of potential danger. However, after receiving the treatment, Meister did not develop any symptoms of rabies, signifying the vaccine's success. This pioneering work by Pasteur and Roux paved the way for modern preventive medicine and vaccination strategies. Today, the rabies vaccine has saved countless lives and has led to the development of vaccines for numerous other infectious diseases. Louis Pasteur's work in the field of immunology goes beyond the rabies vaccine, as he also contributed significantly to the understanding and prevention of diseases such as anthrax, cholera, and tuberculosis. This makes him one of the most influential figures in medical history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Negative usage: 1. In the context of an object or possession: \\"He dropped his phone, and the screen broke.\\" Here, the phrase refers to the physical act of accidentally dropping something, which typically leads to damaging that item – a negative event. 2. When referring to performance or engagement: \\"The company's sales dropped significantly in the past quarter,\\" or \\"The student's grades dropped due to a lack of focus.\\" In these instances, the phrase denotes a downward trend or a decline in performance, which is generally seen as negative. 3. In social relationships, \\"dropped\\" may signify an undesired ending or discontinuation: \\"They suddenly dropped communication,\\" or \\"She dropped out of the project.\\" These examples imply an unanticipated or unwanted interruption, which is generally viewed as unfavorable. In summary, the phrase \\"dropped\\" can take on either positive or negative connotations depending on the context.

The sprawling complex houses modern government offices, the Bedouin tent in which Gadhafi received visitors and stands of palm trees. A bombed-out building remains as a monument to a 1986 U.S. airstrike that killed one of Gadhafi's daughters, along with a statue of a Libyan fist crushing an American jet.  And Tuesday evening, after rebel fighters who have battled Gadhafi's forces for six months punched into the compound, it was wreathed in smoke. Rebels posed around the statue and fired hundreds if not thousands of rounds of ammunition into the air in celebration, spurring the occasional rebuke from senior fighters.  The rebels picked through the compound in search of Libya's longtime strongman, but one fighter told CNN that neither Gadhafi nor any members of his family had been found. Bab al-Aziziya appeared to have been abandoned so quickly that a teakettle remained heating on a stove in one building, he said.  \\"They ran away, all of them,\\" he said. \\"They have gone underground.\\"  Bab al-Aziziya, located near Tripoli's Mediterranean shore, is believed to be undergirded by a network of tunnels.  Abubaker Saad, a former Gadhafi aide, told CNN that at least one of the older buildings on the site was built atop a bunker four stories underground.

Q: why cant you swim in the east river nyc? A:","output":"Step 1: Identify the question The user is asking why it is not possible or not allowed to swim in the East River in New York City. Step 2: Research the topic In order to answer this question, I will collect information about the East River, its water conditions, pollution levels, and any regulations or restrictions that may apply to swimming there. Step 3: Analyze the findings Based on my research, there are several factors that make swimming in the East River in New York City not advisable or prohibited: 1. Water quality: The East River has a history of pollution, with industrial and sewage contamination being major concerns. Although efforts have been made to improve water quality, it still may not be clean enough for safe swimming, posing potential health risks. 2. Currents and tides: The East River is known for its strong currents and tidal variations, which can make swimming dangerous and challenging even for experienced swimmers. Rapidly changing conditions can quickly turn a swim into a dangerous situation. 3. Boat traffic: The East River is a busy waterway with various types of boats, such as ferries, barges, and recreational vessels, frequently passing through. Swimming near or among this boat traffic is risky and may result in serious injury or even death. 4. Regulations and restrictions: Due to the factors mentioned above, swimming in the East River is generally not allowed, and there may be fines or penalties for doing so. Public safety agencies and local authorities discourage swimming in the East River for the protection of everyone involved. Step 4: Provide the answer Based on the analysis of my findings, the main reasons that you cannot swim in the East River in New York City are the water quality, strong currents and tides, boat traffic, and regulations and restrictions put in place to ensure public safety."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: (CNN)It's long been known that dogs and cats, with their highly developed sense of smell, can be trained to identify the volatile chemicals released by human illnesses. In some cases, researchers have even trained household pets to detect cancer or predict epileptic seizures. But what if we could fine tune that sense and put it into a microchip, allowing us to create a breathalyzer for diseases? For Dr. Andrew Koehl, the inventor of the microchip spectrometer technology at the heart of this \\"digital nose\\", the technology that will allow us to do just that is already here. \\"We can detect down to parts per billion levels,\\" Koehl says. \\"To give you an analogy that's equivalent to one drop in an Olympic size swimming pool.\\" The sensor, which is no bigger than a dime, works by creating a spectrum of what chemicals are in the air. It then identifies each chemical's unique make-up. If the sensor is set and calibrated to a certain level, it will trigger an alarm. Work continues to shrink it even further in a bid to enter the healthcare market. Within several years, the company hopes to develop it as a diagnostic tool. \\"What's amazing is that there really are compounds on your breath that indicate illness, that's been shown through a number of studies and we can detect those,\\" he said. \\"There have already been a number of research papers published suggesting we can detect cancer, detect tuberculosis, detect asthma.\\" Initially, the technology had been developed for defense purposes. He said the threat posed by the events of September 11 had got him thinking about the security applications of this type of sensor. \\"Originally it was aimed at detecting things like explosives, toxic chemicals and other threats that might occur,\\" Dr Koehl told CNN. Developed at a research lab at the University of Cambridge in the UK and now in commercial production at a company called Owlstone with close links to the university, Dr Koehl says the sensor is already in use by oil industry giants like BP and Shell and in the food industry by Coca Cola and Nestle. Eventually the sensor could become a part of many everyday appliances, alerting consumers to which foods are going bad in the fridge or even the optimum moment to take the roast out of the oven. You could even, one day, have a digital nose that you could carry in your hip pocket. \\"More recently we've been looking at consumer spaces so we're talking to a number of manufacturers of mobile phones and mobile phone components,\\" he said. \\"We want to develop a module small enough to put into mobile devices like phones.\\"","output":"Imagine if we had a tiny chip that can smell things just like a dog or a cat!

Here are possible answers to this question: - eat - go somewhere - dance - express information - play hockey  I believe the correct choice is \\"dance\\", here's why:","output":"When people feel a lot of excitement, their natural reaction is to engage in activities that channel their high energy and enthusiasm. Out of the options presented, \\"dance\\" is indeed a common and fitting choice as it allows individuals to express their feelings through movement and rhythm. Dancing can trigger the release of endorphins, contributing to overall happiness and a sense of well-being. However, it is essential to recognize that reactions to excitement can vary from person to person, and different individuals might have unique responses. Here's a brief elaboration of the other options: 1. Eat: Some people may indulge in food when they are excited, especially if the event causing excitement is related to food or celebrations such as birthday parties, festivals, or gatherings. 2. Go somewhere: Excitement can also spur a desire to explore new places, share experiences with friends, or embark on a thrilling adventure. Traveling or going somewhere different is one way people might channel their excitement. 3. Express information: Sharing one's excitement with others is a natural response, as it allows individuals to communicate their feelings and build social connections. This expression may occur through various means – face-to-face conversations, phone calls, social media, or other communication channels. 4. Play hockey: Engaging in sports or physical activities can also be an outlet for excitement, as they allow people to vent their energy and focus on a competitive and skilled task. While hockey is a specific example, other sports or recreational activities may serve a similar purpose, depending on personal preferences. In conclusion, while \\"dance\\" is a fitting choice for people to respond to excitement, it is essential to consider individual preferences and inclinations when assessing how people may react in such situations. They may engage in a combination of activities, such as eating, traveling, expressing emotions, or participating in sports, to channel their excitement effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - \\"Something About a Woman\\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Jake Owen.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last of the person who was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience? , can you please find it?   Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would...","output":"The last name of the person who was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience is Bartók.

Summarize this article: The bigger the cow is, the more you have to feed her. Although, a bigger cow may produce more milk, you don’t want a monthly feed bill that exceeds what you’re able to spend.  Holsteins are the biggest eaters and will cost the most. Brown Swiss cows are somewhere in the middle. Jerseys are the smallest and need the least amount to eat. What kind of cow do you think you can handle? Can you deal with nervous cows or would you need to have very docile ones? Take this into consideration when selecting a breed.  Brown Swiss cows are the most docile dairy cows. Holsteins tend to be a bit nervous. Jerseys can be notorious kickers. If you are raising a cow to be part of a dairy farm, obviously milk production will be a crucial factor. On the other hand, if you only need enough milk for your family, you may not need such a high-production breed. You may wish to mix your herd if it's for commercial reasons, such as adding a few Jerseys to a predominantly Holstein herd to increase the Holstein's butterfat content.   If you're looking to maximize milk production, Holsteins are the way to go. If you're only wanting milk for you and your family, you may want to consider a cow that doesn't give as much milk (such as a Jersey). Breeds that are dual-purpose (produce both milk and meat) may be ideal, but this will produce less milk overall. You may also want a dairy cow for butter and cheese making. Jerseys and Brown Swiss produce milk higher in butterfat and protein content, making them ideal for cheese and butter making. Dairy cows that have been culled from conventional dairy operations are cheaper. However, such cows may have injuries, illnesses, or inability to breed back.  If you are a dairy farmer just starting out, avoid these cull animals. As a hobby farmer you may not mind the time, money and feed invested in rescuing and caring for one or two cull dairy cows. Summary:","output":"When choosing a dairy cow, consider factors such as feed costs, temperament, and milk production. Holsteins require the most feed and produce the most milk, while Jerseys need less feed and have lower milk output. Brown Swiss cows are docile and have moderate needs. Assess if you need high-production breeds or dual-purpose ones for milk and meat. Jerseys and Brown Swiss are ideal for butter and cheese making due to their higher butterfat and protein content. Avoid purchasing culled cows if you're starting a dairy farm, as they may have health issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: The Raven Movie plot: After Jean Thatcher (Ware) has been injured in a car accident, her father, Judge Thatcher (Hinds) and beau Jerry (Matthews) implore retired surgeon Dr. Richard Vollin (Lugosi) to perform a delicate operation to restore her to health. Vollin agrees and is successful; he befriends the spirited and grateful Jean, in the process revealing his passion for all things related to Edgar Allan Poe, including his homemade collection of torture devices inspired by Poe's works (such as a pit, pendulum with crescent razor, shrinking room, etc.), and identifying the raven as his talisman. After Vollin reveals his growing love for Jean to her father, the Judge quickly discourages him from the affair. Angered, Vollin hatches a plan when Edmond Bateman (Karloff), a murderer on the run, comes to his home asking for a new face so he may live in anonymity. Vollin admits to not being a plastic surgeon, but says he can help Bateman, and asks him to help in exacting revenge on the Thatchers, which he refuses. Bateman explains that he feels his antisocial behavior is a result of having been called ugly all his life, and he hopes a new face may gave him a chance to end it. Vollin performs the surgery, but instead turns Bateman into a disfigured monster, promising only to operate again on Bateman when Vollin's revenge is exacted. Bateman finally reluctantly agrees. Vollin hosts a dinner party, among which Jean, Jerry, and the Judge are guests. One by one, the guests are caught in the Poe-inspired traps.

She attained popular success as a country female vocalist during the 1960s and early 1970s and was twice nominated for the Best Female Country Vocal Performance Grammy award. Many of her hits were written by her husband at the time, Harlan Howard. Howard's biggest hit and signature song was the 1966 country hit \\"Evil on Your Mind\\", which peaked at number five on the Billboard country charts. In 1959, under the name Jan Howard, she released the single \\"Yankee Go Home\\", which failed to hit the country charts. In 1960, the Howards went to Nashville, Tennessee, where they appeared on The Prince Albert Show, the Grand Ole Opry segment carried nationally by NBC Radio. Howard then released her first single under her new record company, Challenge. Titled \\"The One You Slip Around With\\", the song was Howard's first significant country hit, hitting the top 15, peaking at number 13 on the Billboard country music chart and earning her several Most Promising Female Vocalist awards (over, among others, another newcomer, Loretta Lynn). Occasional appearances on the Grand Ole Opry led to friendships with several country singers, including Patsy Cline. According to Cline's 1980 biography, Honky Tonk Angel, Cline originally yelled at Howard after a performance on the Opry stage. Howard fought back, and Cline was shocked by her reply. Cline then said to Howard, \\"Anybody who stands up to Cline is all right, we're gonna be good friends.\\" The two were good friends until Cline's death in 1963.  Meanwhile, painfully shy Jan was suffering from the psychological scars of her youth, as well as the anxiety of beginning a new adventure. When her weight dropped below 97 pounds, Harlan hospitalized Jan and she went into therapy.  Howard appeared on ABC-TV's Jubilee USA on February 6, 1960, and later that year she won Billboard magazine's Most Promising Female Country Award. In 1962, she charted successfully on the country charts at number 27 with, \\"I Wish I Was a Single Girl Again\\". However, none of Howard's follow-up singles was successful.

The latter proposes a risky operation to rescue Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona), the imprisoned leader of a Southern African nation who is due to be executed by General Ndofa, the man who deposed him. Limbani is currently being held in a remote prison in Zembala, guarded by a unit of Ndofa's personal troops known as the \\"Simbas\\".

Believes the 2003 invasion of the country was a 'political cock-up' Says the people of Iraq are not better off since the war in the country. Warns against UK forces going back into the country again. Major General led Royal Marines during the 1982 Falklands War. Article:","output":"Title: Major General Faults UK Politicians for the 'Complete Mess' in Iraq: A Deep Dive into the Consequences and Possible Solutions The 2003 invasion of Iraq has long been a subject of scrutiny and controversy. Major General Julian Thompson, a prominent figure in the military who led the Royal Marines during the 1982 Falklands War, has recently come forward to put the blame of the disastrous situation in Iraq firmly on the shoulders of UK politicians. Thompson unabashedly refers to the invasion as a “political cock-up,” highlighting the fact that little has improved for the citizens of Iraq since the war. In this article, we delve deeper into the Major General's assertions, examining the consequences of the invasion and whether the UK should shoulder responsibility for attempting to heal the wounds left behind through further intervention. It is important to first understand the motivations behind the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a war that toppled Saddam Hussein's regime but left the country in a state of turmoil. The campaign, which was led by the United States and supported by the UK, was based on the belief that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). As it later became apparent, this belief was unfounded, further damaging the credibility of the UK’s involvement. According to Major General Thompson, the people of Iraq have not been better off since the war. The invasion and its aftermath led to the rise of ISIS, fueling a sectarian conflict that the country is still grappling with today. The devastation endured by the Iraqi population extends far beyond the immediate violence of the war itself, with lasting effects such as damaged infrastructure, fractured communities, and an ever-present culture of fear. In light of these conditions, it is difficult not to see the wisdom in the Major General's words. Having experienced the challenges of leading military forces in war, Thompson also warns against the UK making the same mistake twice by re-entering the country. The Major General's cautionary words are supported by the fact that the last attempt to intervene in Iraq not only failed to achieve its objectives but also created a new set of problems for the people of Iraq to contend with. Instead of attempting another military intervention, the Major General suggests that the UK should explore other avenues of support. These might include diplomatic efforts to help establish a stable government in Iraq, offering financial assistance to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure, and working collaboratively with international teams to stem the influence of extremist groups in the country. Given the current global landscape, with wars and military conflict continuing to wreak havoc on countless lives, it is crucial for UK politicians to learn from the mistakes made during the Iraq invasion. It is evident that the well-being of the people of Iraq has not been sufficiently addressed, creating an environment where violence and sectarian tensions can continue to thrive. In conclusion, Major General Julian Thompson makes a compelling case for UK politicians to reconsider their approach to foreign policy. As the consequences of the 2003 invasion of Iraq remain, it is now the responsibility of the UK and its allies to reflect on their missteps and take responsibility for their actions. Recognizing and learning from these errors is the first step towards creating a more just and stable world for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to buy silver stocks  Reduce your portfolio risk.  Research suggests that precious metals have a weak, negative correlation to equities markets. This means that when regular stock prices decline, silver, and by extension your silver stocks, will either increase in value, remain unaffected, or at least not lose as much value as the remainder of your portfolio.","output":"1. Identify silver stocks to invest in     - In order to buy silver stocks, we first need to identify potential silver companies that are publicly traded. Look for established companies with strong financials and a good track record in the industry. This can be done by searching stock market platforms or financial news websites for recommendations and lists of top silver stocks. 2. Conduct thorough research     - After identifying potential silver stocks, conduct thorough research on each. Look at their financial statements, annual reports, and any public announcements or news articles featuring the company. Analyze their revenue, net income, debt levels, cash flow, and other financial metrics to determine if they are a financially sound investment. 3. Diversify your silver stocks     - Instead of putting all your money into one silver stock, it's essential to diversify your investment across several silver companies. This helps to minimize the risk of any one company underperforming or suffering a decline in its stock price. Look for companies operating in different regions, with varying levels of production, and focused on different aspects of the silver mining and refining process. 4. Assess your risk tolerance     - Consider how much risk you are willing to take with your investment in silver stocks. Remember that investing in stocks comes with inherent risks, and the price of silver can be volatile. Adjust your portfolio allocation based on your risk tolerance, ensuring that you maintain a well-balanced and diversified portfolio. 5. Choose a reliable brokerage platform     - To buy silver stocks, you will need to open an account with a reliable brokerage platform offering the silver stocks you want to invest in. Compare platforms based on fees, customer support, trading tools, and overall reputation before making a decision. 6. Place your order     - After opening your brokerage account, you can place an order to buy silver stocks. Be familiar with the platform's trading tools and types of orders available, such as market orders (buying stocks at the current market price) and limit orders (buying stocks only if the price reaches a specified limit). 7. Monitor your investment     - Once you have purchased your silver stocks, regularly monitor your investment's performance. Pay attention to news and announcements related to the companies you have invested in, as well as any global factors that may affect the price of silver. This will help you make informed decisions about when to buy more or sell your existing holdings. By following these steps, you can successfully buy silver stocks, diversify your portfolio, and potentially reduce the overall risk of your investments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Increasingly, companies and organizations are utilizing structured data for analysis because of its high degrees of organization, which allow for powerful and rapid analysis. From the sentence \\"Albert Jennings Fountain was born in the United States where African Americans are an ethnic group\\" we could extract several different elements of structured data: 1. Individual Person Data: The name of the person mentioned in the sentence, \\"Albert Jennings Fountain\\", can be extracted as a structured data element. This can later be mapped to an entity in a database storing personal information. 2. Geographic Data: \\"The United States\\" is mentioned as a geographical location. This information can be normalized and stored as structured data under a geography category. 3. Ethnic Group Data: The phrase \\"African Americans are an ethnic group\\" suggests an ethnic group data point, 'African Americans'. This piece of data can be associated with the previously mentioned geographic location, indicating that the ethnic group resides in the United States. The structured data derived from this sentence would look like this in a tabular form: | Person         | Place of Birth | Ethnic Group  | |----------------|----------------|---------------| | Albert Jennings Fountain | United States | African Americans | However, it should be noted that the context of the information here is indirect. The sentence does not explicitly state that Albert Jennings Fountain is an African American or born into the ethnic group of African Americans. Instead, it generally states that African Americans are an ethnic group in the United States. Therefore, these structured data elements should be treated as separate information pieces rather than directly linked attributes of Mr. Fountain. As such, in understanding structured data, precision and context are just as vital as the data points themselves. Misinterpretation of context can lead to incorrect associations and therefore, misleading analyses.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Vampire Bat is set in the small German village of Klineschloss where Gustave Schoen (Lionel Belmore) the Burgermeister is holding a meeting with Inspector Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas) from the local constabulary about all the recent murders, six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood & bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks. Brettschneider doesn't have a single clue but the superstitious elders of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a Vampire. Brettschneider isn't convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large Bat, meanwhile the latest victim Martha Mueller (Rita Carlyle) has been found. Brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant Vampire Bat is responsible & if it is how's he going to stop it? Directed by Frank R. Strayer The Vampire Bat was a cheapie from Majestic Pictures to cash in on the success of it's two stars Atwill & Wray & their success in the previous years Doctor X (1932) & is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative & enticing title may have lead you to believe & quite frankly it's rather dull. The script by Edward T. Lowe Jr. takes itself rather seriously & sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers & that something could possibly be a Vampire, then for most of it's duration the film focuses on Brettschneider & his incompetent investigations which are, not to put too fine a point on it, boring. The Vampire Bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it doesn't quite know what it wants to be, the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly sci-fi. There is no Vampire Bat, the attempts to fool you are pathetic, all the character's are broad stereotypes & you can tell the villain of the piece straight away & as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about The Vampire Bat. I know it's old but that's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 & a bland, flat, dull, boring & misleading film such as The Vampire Bat just doesn't cut it these days, just look at the original King Kong (1933) released the same year & how brilliantly that still holds up today. I didn't like it & I doubt many modern film-goers would either, it's as simple & straight forward as that. Director Strayer doesn't do anything special but this is a case in point where I can cut the film some slack because of it's age, as a whole it's pretty much point, shoot & hope for the best stuff. There isn't much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from The Old Dark House (1932) & Universal's European set on their back-lot are nice & add a certain ambiance to things. Technically The Vampire Bat can't compare to anything even remotely modern, for the age of it it's alright I suppose but again I draw your attention back to the original King Kong. Speaking of King Kong it's star Fay Wray has a role in this as does horror icon Lionel Atwill, I'll be kind & say the acting is OK. The Vampire Bat will I imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that it's a horror film about Vampire Bats when in fact it isn't, personally I thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore. It's short & it tells it's story reasonably enough but I must admit I'm not a fan. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?

Let me try to make it simpler for you. Wind, cyclones, and anti-cyclones are caused by the heat from the sun. When the sun heats the Earth, it also heats up the air above it. Warm air likes to rise, and cooler air likes to sink. So, when the warm air goes up, it leaves a space, and the cooler air moves in to fill this space. This movement of air is what we call wind. Cyclones and anti-cyclones are like big spinning circles of wind. Cyclones happen when warm air rises quickly and spins around, creating a storm. Anti-cyclones are the opposite; they happen when cool air sinks down and spins in the opposite direction, making the weather calm and clear. So, sun's heat creates differences in air temperature, and this movement of air creates wind, cyclones, and anti-cyclones."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: In the merry-go-round of GOP presidential politics, is it about to be Newt Gingrich‘s time to take a turn as a frontrunner? Recent polls suggest that he’s on the way up, currently in a respectable third place behind an embattled Herman Cain and a tepidly-supported Mitt Romney. Perhaps more importantly, Gingrich is escalating his use of over-the-top rhetoric that will get him more attention, as he did this weekend when he likened President Obama to convicted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff.      The comment came during a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate that Gingrich shared with Herman Cain, which proved to be more of a media circus than meaningful debate due to Cain’s recent sexual harassment allegations. In fact, the most noteworthy item that came from the debate was Cain’s blasting of the press for asking questions about the scandal surrounding him.      Gingrich drew a predictably unfavorable comparison between GOP saint Ronald Reagan and the current sitting president, though the metaphor was more focused on their respective rhetoric:      We have today a President and….compare him to Ronald Reagan who told the truth — great book called “The Education of Ronald Reagan” on lessons he learned at General Electric — compare Reagan’s ability to talk directly to the American people, make sense and have the American people move the Congress with the current president. This president is about as candid and accurate as Bernie Madoff in what he tells the American people.      Now that‘s hyperbole!      It’s easy to dismiss this sort of over-the-top political rhetoric as poetic license, but comparing President Obama with a convicted felon who bilked millions of individual investors with lies and deceit will likely only resonate with voters who have already long decided that Obama is the Worst President Ever™ no matter what evidence is presented to them, one way or the other.      Watch the clip below, courtesy of C-SPAN (H/T Business Insider):      Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| Was it a thoughtful pause or an indication that Herman Cain may not know as much about Medicare as a presidential hopeful should? That’s just one question that arose in the wake of this weekend’s debate between Cain and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.      At one point during the evening, Americans for Prosperity Texas chairman Ben Streusand asked Cain whether he favored a “defined benefit plan” or “premium support” when it comes to Medicare. Cain repeated the question to himself while looking upward and appearing to mull it over, later turning it over to Gingrich to answer first.

This regularity can be observed in the consistency of Slovak morphological patterns compared to the more irregular patterns found in Czech. One example highlighted in the article is the change from the nominative to the locative case. In the mentioned example, when changing the word \\"Praha\\" (the capital city of the Czech Republic) from nominative to locative case, the transformation is more regular in Slovak. In Czech, \\"Praha\\" becomes \\"Praze,\\" while in Slovak, it becomes \\"Prahe.\\" This illustrates how Slovak maintains a more consistent and regular pattern when compared to Czech. Moreover, the article states that the two lexicons – Czech and Slovak – are generally considered similar despite their 80% difference. This difference is primarily due to differing orthographies (spelling systems) and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation. The majority of differences between the two languages can be found in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology. Additionally, it's noted that Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech. In conclusion, Slovak morphology is more regular than Czech when it comes to forming word structures and changing cases in a sentence. This can be observed in the consistent morphological patterns in Slovak, making it easier to predict how words will change across different cases compared to the more irregular patterns present in Czech."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation.

Q:Information:  - McKinley Morganfield (April 4, 1913  April 30, 1983), better known as Muddy Waters, was an American blues musician who is often cited as the \\"father of modern Chicago blues\\".  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.  - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port in the State of Missouri, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, on the border with Illinois. The city has an estimated 2015 population of 315,685, and is the cultural and economic center of the Greater St. Louis area (home to 2,916,447 people), making it the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the 19th-largest in the United States.  - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.  - A work song is a piece of music closely connected to a form of work, either sung while conducting a task (usually to coordinate timing) or a song linked to a task which might be a connected narrative, description, or protest song.  - The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of \\"The Oxford Companion to Music\\", Percy Scholes defines musical form as \\"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\\"  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Cologne is the largest city in the German federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth-largest city in Germany (after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich). It is located within the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, one of the major European metropolitan regions and the largest in Germany, with more than ten million inhabitants.  - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it.  - A chant (from French ', from Latin ', \\"to sing\\") is the rhythmic speaking or singing of words or sounds, often primarily on one or two main pitches called reciting tones. Chants may range from a simple melody involving a limited set of notes to highly complex musical structures, often including a great deal of repetition of musical subphrases, such as Great Responsories and Offertories of Gregorian chant. Chant may be considered speech, music, or a heightened or stylized form of speech. In the later Middle Ages some religious chant evolved into song (forming one of the roots of later Western music).  - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power.  - Manhattan is the most densely populated borough of New York City, its economic and administrative center, and the city's historical birthplace. The borough is coextensive with New York County, founded on November 1, 1683, as one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York. The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the East, Hudson, and Harlem rivers, and also includes several small adjacent islands and Marble Hill, a small neighborhood on the U.S. mainland.  - Nick Katzman ( born 1951 ) is an American blues musician . Katzman was born in New York City , and lives in both Manhattan and Berlin , Germany . He plays in a variety of musical genres , including Chicago blues , Mississippi blues , Texas blues , and ragtime .  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - Ernest Hogan (born Ernest Reuben Crowdus; 1865  May 20, 1909) was the first African-American entertainer to produce and star in a Broadway show (\\"The Oyster Man\\" in 1907) and helped to popularize the musical genre of ragtime.  - Harlem is a large neighborhood in the northern section of the New York City borough of Manhattan. Since the 1920s, Harlem has been known as a major African-American residential, cultural and business center. Originally a Dutch village, formally organized in 1658, it is named after the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands. Harlem's history has been defined by a series of economic boom-and-bust cycles, with significant population shifts accompanying each cycle.  - The \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (copyright registered on 18 September 1899) is an early ragtime musical composition for piano composed by Scott Joplin. It was one of Joplin's early works, and became the model for ragtime compositions by subsequent composers. It is one of the most famous of all ragtime pieces. As a result Joplin was called the \\"King of Ragtime\\". The piece gave Joplin a steady if unspectacular income for the rest of his life.  - John Philip Sousa (November 6, 1854  March 6, 1932) was an American composer and conductor of the late Romantic era, known primarily for American military and patriotic marches. Because of his mastery of march composition, he is known as \\"The March King\\", or the \\"American March King\\" due to his British counterpart Kenneth J. Alford also being known by the former nickname. Among his best-known marches are \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" (National March of the United States of America), \\"Semper Fidelis\\" (Official March of the United States Marine Corps), \\"The Liberty Bell\\" (used as the theme for Monty Python's Flying Circus), \\"The Thunderer\\" and \\"The Washington Post\\".  - Bruce Iglauer (born July 10, 1947, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States) is the American founder and head of the independent blues record label Alligator Records in Chicago.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \\"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles.  - The Deep South is a cultural and geographic subregion in the Southern United States. Historically, it is differentiated from the \\"Upper South\\" as being the states most dependent on plantation-type agriculture and considered slave societies during the preCivil War period. The Deep South was also commonly referred to as the Lower South or the Cotton States, for their production of cotton as the primary commodity crop.  - The Chicago blues is a form of blues music indigenous to Chicago, Illinois. Chicago blues is a type of urban blues. Urban blues evolved from classic blues following the Great Migration, or the Great Northern Drive, which was both forced and voluntary at times, of African-Americans from the southern United States to the industrial cities of the north, such as Chicago. Muddy Waters directly joined that migration, like many others, such as in Florida, avoiding the more harshly southern Jim Crow laws. Bruce Iglauer, founder of Alligator Records stated that, \\"Chicago blues is the music of the industrial city, and has an industrial sense about it.\\" Additionally, recognizing the shift in blues, Chicago Blues singer and guitarist, Kevin Moore expressed the blues transition stating, \\"You have to put some new life into it, new blood, new perspectives. You can't keep talking about mules, workin' on the levee.\\" Chicago blues was heavily influenced by Mississippi bluesman who traveled to Chicago in the early 1940s. The development of blues, up to Chicago blues, is arguably as follows: Country blues, to city blues, to urban blues\\". Chicago blues is based around the sound of the electric guitar and the harmonica, with the harmonica played through a PA system or guitar amplifier.  - Research comprises \\"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\" It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc.  - Scott Joplin (1867/68  April 1, 1917) was an African-American composer and pianist. Joplin achieved fame for his ragtime compositions and was dubbed the \\"King of Ragtime Writers\\". During his brief career, he wrote 44 original ragtime pieces, one ragtime ballet, and two operas. One of his first pieces, the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", became ragtime's first and most influential hit, and has been recognized as the archetypal rag.  - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs  printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages  the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments.  - Düsseldorf (Low Franconian, Ripuarian: \\"Düsseldörp\\" ) is the capital city of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the seventh most populous city in Germany. Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs. The city is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows.  - A guitar amplifier (or guitar amp) is an electronic amplifier that strengthens the weak electrical signal from a pickup on an electric guitar, bass guitar, or acoustic guitar so that it can produce sound through one or more loudspeakers, which are typically housed in a wooden cabinet. A guitar amplifier may be a standalone wood or metal cabinet that contains only the power amplifier (and preamplifier) circuits, requiring the use of a separate speaker cabinetor it may be a \\"combo\\" amplifier, which contains both the amplifier and one or more speakers in a wooden cabinet. There is a wide range of sizes and power ratings for guitar amplifiers, from small, lightweight \\"practice amplifiers\\" with a single 8\\" speaker to heavy combo amps with four 10\\" speakers and a powerful amplifier, which are loud enough to use in a nightclub or bar performance.  - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names.  - The headquarters of the United Nations is a complex in New York City designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. The complex has served as the official headquarters of the United Nations since its completion in 1952. It is located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, on spacious grounds overlooking the East River. Its borders are First Avenue on the west, East 42nd Street to the south, East 48th Street on the north and the East River to the east. The term \\"Turtle Bay\\" is occasionally used as a metonym for the UN headquarters or for the United Nations as a whole.  - Headquarters (HQ) denotes the location where most, if not all, of the important functions of an organization are coordinated. In the United States, the corporate headquarters represents the entity at the center or the top of a corporation taking full responsibility for managing all business activities. In the UK, the term head office is most commonly used for the HQs of large corporations. The term is also used regarding military organizations.  - A musician (or instrumentalist) is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music may also be referred to as a musician.   - Benjamin Robertson \\"Ben\\" Harney (March 6, 1872  March 2, 1938) was an American songwriter, entertainer, and pioneer of ragtime music. His 1896 composition \\"You've Been a Good Old Wagon but You Done Broke Down\\" is regarded as one of the early ragtime composition. In 1924, the New York Times wrote that Ben Harney \\"probably did more to popularize ragtime than any other person.\\" Time Magazine termed him \\"Ragtime's Father\\" in 1938.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.

Here is a detailed analysis of each sentence: Sentence 1: \\"After the death of his father, James Holman, on 4 March 1827 he was elected king in the presence of King George.\\" In this sentence, James Holman is the father who passed away on March 4, 1827. After his death, his son (whose name is not mentioned) was elected king. This event occurred in the presence of King George, who can be inferred as a separate person, possibly a monarch from another kingdom, witnessing the election of the new king. Sentence 2: \\"After the death of his father, King George, he was elected king in the presence of James Holman on March 4, 1827.\\" In this sentence, the father who died is King George, and the event took place on March 4, 1827. After his death, his son (whose name is, once again, not mentioned) was elected king. This time, James Holman is not the deceased father but a separate individual who was present during the election of the new king. In summary, the difference between the two sentences lies in the identities of the deceased father and the person witnessing the election of the new king. In Sentence 1, the father is James Holman, and the witness is King George. In Sentence 2, the father is King George, while James Holman is the witness. So, although they have similarities in structure, they convey different information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you're new to following recipes, get out all of the ingredients you'll need and prepare them. If a recipe calls for dicing, mincing, or slicing ingredients, for instance, do all of the prep work first so you can start making the food. If you already feel comfortable doing prep work while you cook food, read through the recipe to see when to do specific prep. For example, if you're caramelizing onions, they'll probably take a long time. Get them cooking and then prep the rest of the ingredients while they're caramelizing. Instead of roasting large chunks of vegetables or boiling entire potatoes, chop them into smaller pieces than you usually do. Vegetables that are 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) in size will cook much faster than 2 to 3 in (51 to 76 mm) pieces.  If you're really short on time, try dicing or grating the food. For example, instead of cooking chunks of home fries, grate the potatoes to make hashbrowns. You can even cut meat and seafood into smaller pieces. Slice a large roast or fillet into smaller and thinner pieces to cut down on cooking time. A lot of cooking and baking recipes direct you to use softened butter instead of cold butter from the fridge or freezer. Although you could warm the butter in the microwave, you might accidentally melt it. Try grating the butter against the coarse side of a box grater before using it in the recipe.  This works best if the butter is very cold or frozen. Try this trick the next time you're baking biscuits or scones. It's much easier than rubbing or cutting chunks of butter into the dry mixture! The time you spend washing, chopping, and preparing ingredients adds up if you're cooking every day. To save on some of this prep time, consider what you'll be cooking for the week and prep the ingredients at the same time. Then, you can just pull what you need out of the refrigerator when you're ready to cook. For example, if you need diced onion for 2 meals, chop the onion and store them in separate containers in the refrigerator. If you're making rice for dinner and you also plan to serve it in a few days, make a double batch and refrigerate half of it. If you're making a few different things to serve, think about which dishes take the longest to cook and which can be prepared right before serving. If it helps you stay organized, write down a timeline of when to prep and cook each dish. Your list might look like this:  Marinate chicken for 3 hours Start the grill 30 minutes before dinner time Remove the chicken and thread it onto skewers Put the chicken skewers on the grill  Bring a pot of water to boil and cook rice noodles Remove the chicken from the grill Make a tossed salad to serve with the chicken and rice noodles Your food will cook evenly if the oven is already at the recommended temperature when you put the food in. If you put food into a cold oven while it's heating up, it will take longer to cook and the bottom or outside of the food could overcook before the center is done. For example, if you toss a frozen pizza into a cold oven that's heating up, the bottom may burn while the center only becomes warm. If you put it into a hot oven, the whole pizza will cook within the recommended time.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - An economist is a practitioner in the social science discipline of economics.  - John Locke (29 August 1632  28 October 1704) was an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the \\"Father of Liberalism\\". Considered one of the first of the British empiricists, following the tradition of Sir Francis Bacon, he is equally important to social contract theory. His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence.  - Greater Boston is the metropolitan region of New England encompassing the municipality of Boston, the capital of the U.S. state of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England, as well as its surrounding areas. The region forms the northern arc of the U.S. northeast megalopolis and as such, Greater Boston can be described as either a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), or as a broader combined statistical area (CSA). The MSA consists of most of the eastern third of Massachusetts, excluding the South Coast region and Cape Cod; while the CSA additionally includes the municipalities of Manchester (the largest city in the U.S. state of New Hampshire), Providence (the capital of the U.S. state of Rhode Island), Worcester, Massachusetts (the second largest city in New England), as well as the South Coast region and Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Greater Boston's most impactful contributions to human civilization involve the region's higher education institutions and sports culture. Greater Boston also constitutes a region influential upon American history and industry. The region and the state of Massachusetts are global leaders in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - A single tax is a system of taxation based mainly or exclusively on one tax, typically chosen for its special properties, often being a tax on land value. The idea of a single tax on land values was proposed independently by John Locke and Baruch Spinoza in the 17th century. The French physiocrats later coined the term \\"impôt unique\\" because of the unique characteristics of land and rent.  - Harvard is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts. The town is located 25 miles west-northwest of Boston, in eastern Massachusetts. A farming community settled in 1658 and incorporated in 1732, it has been home to several non-traditional communities, such as Harvard Shaker Village and the utopian Transcendentalist center Fruitlands. Today it is an affluent residential town noted for its excellent public schools, with its students consistently ranking in the state's top ten test results in English and math. The population was 6,520 at the 2010 census.   - In the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area. Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states. As such, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g., Chicago or Atlanta). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g., DallasFort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), RiversideSan Bernardino (Inland Empire) or MinneapolisSaint Paul).  - Frederick Fiske Warren ( 2 July 1862 -- 2 February 1938 ) was a successful paper manufacturer , fine arts denizen , United States tennis champion of 1893 , and major supporter of Henry George 's single tax system which he helped develop in Harvard , Massachusetts , United States , in the 1930s . Fiske Warren established Georgist single tax colonies and a social experiment in Andorra to disprove Malthus 's population theory . He was the son of Samuel Dennis Warren and Susan Cornelia Warren of Beacon Hill , Boston , and the brother to U.S. Attorney Samuel D. Warren and to Edward Perry Warren .  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - Beacon Hill is a historic neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood is 9,023.  - Baruch Spinoza (born Benedito de Espinosa, ; 24 November 1632  21 February 1677, later Benedict de Spinoza) was a Dutch philosopher of Sephardi/Portuguese origin. By laying the groundwork for the 18th-century Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern conceptions of the self and the universe, he came to be considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy.  - Edward Perry Warren (January 8, 1860  December 28, 1928), known as Ned Warren, was an American art collector and the author of works proposing an idealized view of homosexual relationships. He is now best known as the former owner of the Warren Cup in the British Museum.  - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - Henry George (September 2, 1839  October 29, 1897) was an American political economist, journalist, and philosopher. His immensely popular writing is credited with sparking several reform movements of the Progressive Era, and inspiring the broad economic philosophy known as Georgism, based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves, but that the economic value derived from land (including natural resources) should belong equally to all members of society.  - Boston (pronounced ) is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States. Boston is also the seat of Suffolk County, although the county government was disbanded on July 1, 1999. The city proper covers with an estimated population of 667,137 in 2015, making it the largest city in New England and the 23rd most populous city in the United States. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.7 million people in 2014 and ranking as the tenth-largest such area in the country. Alternately, as a Combined Statistical Area (CSA), this wider commuting region is home to some 8.1 million people, making it the sixth-largest as such in the United States.  - Georgism, also called geoism and single tax (archaic), is an economic philosophy holding that, while people should own the value they produce themselves, economic value derived from land (including natural resources and natural opportunities) should belong equally to all members of society. Developed from the writings of Henry George, the Georgist paradigm offers solutions to social and ecological problems, relying on principles of land rights and public finance which attempt to integrate economic efficiency with social justice.

(b). blocks dull.","output":"The monkey loved to play with the balls but ignored the blocks because he found the blocks dull. The colorful and bouncy balls were far more appealing to the curious little monkey than the unexciting, solid blocks. Even though the blocks had the potential to be stacked and built into various structures, the monkey couldn't see beyond their bland appearances and rigid angles. The balls, on the other hand, offered seemingly endless entertainment as they rolled and bounced in unpredictable ways, stimulating the monkey's mind and satisfying his playful spirit. As the monkey continued to play with the balls, he would often find himself tossing them from one hand to another, sometimes even using his prehensile tail to catch them in mid-air. His agility and dexterity were remarkable, and the other animals in the jungle marveled at his acrobatic prowess. The monkey reveled in the attention he received, which only fueled his preference for the balls over the blocks. However, he didn't realize that the blocks could have contributed significantly to his cognitive development. They had the potential to teach him about problem-solving, balance, and spatial awareness. If he had given the blocks a chance, his playtime could have been both enjoyable and educational, helping him grow as an individual and equipping him with valuable skills for survival in the jungle. But as the days passed by, the monkey continued to disregard the blocks, which had been slowly accumulating dust in the corner of his play area. He was enamored with the balls, convinced that they were the epitome of entertainment. One day, however, something unexpected happened. It began to rain heavily, and the balls, being lightweight and buoyant, started to float away in the rising floodwaters. Seeing his favorite toys floating away, the monkey was devastated but quickly realized that the blocks, with their weight and solidity, remained anchored on the ground. Desperate to save his precious balls, he began to stack and arrange the blocks, forming makeshift barriers to keep the balls from being swept away by the currents. In this moment of crisis, he discovered that the blocks had a purpose and value after all. From this experience, the monkey learned that sometimes the most unassuming objects can hold hidden potential. He recognized that the blocks, which he once deemed dull and unworthy of his time, could be immensely useful and even enjoyable when creatively utilized. This lesson stayed with the monkey as he continued to grow and explore his jungle home, and he never again underestimated the value of any object, regardless of its appearance or initial impression. Thanks to this newfound wisdom, the monkey became a versatile and resourceful member of the jungle community, admired and respected by his fellow animals for his ability to see potential in everything around him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Voters will decide between the Democratic candidate  , Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump of the Republicans. But the voting is not a must for each person in the US. So quite a lot of people choose not to vote, especially the young generation. According to Fox News, one-in-five young voters between the ages of 18 and 35 said clearly that they wouldn't vote for either of the two candidates. Just 12 percent of voters aged 35-54, and only nine percent of voters aged 55 and older said the same thing. This is not only because young people don't like Clinton or Trump, according to theFortunemagazine. The truth is that they are traditionally less likely to vote than their parents. \\"Young people are not at an age in their life when they think politics or government has anything to do with them,\\" said Rodd Freitag, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, US. \\"But for the older age groups, they have a home, they pay taxes  , they care about schools and the community.\\" Many believe that the civic   education of an American youth is another reason why they don't vote.

Context: A school board in the eastern state of Virginia has filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt a ruling that allows a transgender student to use the boys’ restroom next school year. The Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \\"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.'' Grimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys’ restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person’s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies. Grimm was born female but identifies as male. \\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote. The ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S. The Obama administration in May directed the nation’s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration. The school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August. Question: What does the school board want?

Option b, positive, is the correct choice in this context. Let's break down the sentence to understand why the sentiment is positive: 1. \\"powerful\\" - This adjective signifies strength, intensity, or effectiveness, which is regarded as a positive trait or quality in creative works, including movies. 2. \\"naturally dramatic\\" - This phrase implies that the drama in the film occurs organically, without being forced or artificial. This term is also viewed as a positive quality in filmmaking, as it suggests the film manages to evoke emotions and engage the audience in a genuine way. 3. \\"low-budget\\" - While this term generally refers to the limited financial resources used to make the film, it does not necessarily imply a negative sentiment. In this context, the sentence indicates the movie's achievements in being powerful and dramatic despite the budget constraints. This showcases the filmmakers' ability to make a strong impact on their audience with limited resources, which is a commendable and positive aspect.

Background: John Charles Wiltshire-Butler (born 1 April 1975), known professionally as John Butler, is an Australian singer, songwriter, and music producer. He is the front man for the John Butler Trio, a roots and jam band, which formed in Fremantle, Western Australia in 1998. The John Butler Trio has recorded five studio albums including three that have reached number one on the Australian charts: Sunrise Over Sea, Grand National and April Uprising. His recordings and live performances have met with critical praise and have garnered awards from the Australian Performing Right Association and Australian Recording Industry Association. Context: The early sessions for the John Butler Trio's sixth studio album commenced in mid-2013, following the band's largest tour of the US. For the first time in the band's lifetime, the members began with a blank songwriting slate, rather than using the initial ideas of Butler that had been introduced. Butler gathered with Luiters and Bomba at The Compound in Fremantle, Western Australia, which serves as the band's headquarters and the frontman's artistic space, and co-wrote material for the first time, deviating from the Butler-centric process of the past: \\"I had always brought the material.\\" After contributing a large portion of work towards the album, Bomba eventually left the Compound space to work on his Melbourne Ska Orchestra project and was replaced by Grant Gerathy.  Butler explained in an interview during the band's US tour:  But a lot of these songs on this album I kind of magpied. Magpies are this bird in Australia that takes shiny things from anywhere and builds its nest, and so that's kind of what I do. I'll take a little of my own experience of having some heavy party time with certain friends, and then I'll hear some other stories about addicts or other intense relationships. I'll put them into the mixing pot and make up these characters to explore different possibilities and emotional landscapes.  One of the songs on the album, \\"Wings Are Wide\\", was written as a dedication to his grandmother, who gave Butler his grandfather's Dobro guitar that became the foundation for his songwriting. Butler admitted that \\"I wasn't at all into roots music or playing the slide or anything when I got it, and it sat under my bed for a long, long time.\\" Released in Australia on 8 February 2014, Flesh and Blood was produced by Jan Skubiszewski and features a vocal duet with Ainslie Wills.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It often happens that a number of applicants with almost the same qualifications and experience all apply for the same position. In their educational background, special skills and work experience, there is little, if anything, to choose between half a dozen candidates. How then does the employer make a choice? Usually on the basis of an interview. There are many arguments for and against the interview as a way of selection. The main argument against it is that it results in a wholly _ decision. As often as not, employers do not choose the best candidate. They choose the candidate who makes a good first impression on them. Some employers, of course, reply to this argument by saying that they have become so experienced in interviewing staff that they are able to make a good assessment of each candidate's likely performance. The main argument in favor of the interview is that an employer is concerned not only with a candidate's ability, but with his or her suitable personality for the particular work situation. Many employers, for example, will overlook occasional mistakes from their secretary if she has a pleasant personality. It is perhaps true to say, therefore, that the real purpose of an interview is not to assess the assessable aspects of each candidate but to make a guess at the things that are hard to measure, such as personality, character and social ability. Unfortunately, both for the employers and applicants for jobs, there are many people of great ability who simply do not interview well. There are also, of course, people who interview extremely well, but are later found to be very unsatisfactory employees. Candidates who interview well tend to be quietly confident, but never boastful , direct and straightforward in their questions and answers; cheerful and friendly, but never over-familiar; and sincerely enthusiastic and optimistic. Candidates who interview badly tend to be either very shy or over-confident. They either talk too little or never stop talking. They are either over polite or a bit rude.

As a changed man burdened with guilt and shame, Terrell's primary goal upon release is to seek redemption and a fresh start in the world outside the confines of his prison cell. Upon reentering society, Terrell moves in with his estranged sister, Jasmine. Though their relationship has been strained since Terrell's incarceration, she is his only family and support system on the outside. Jasmine works hard to keep Terrell focused on rebuilding his life, helping him secure a job at a local construction site. Despite Terrell's best efforts to leave his criminal past in the past, he unexpectedly encounters an old acquaintance, Ray, a slimy and manipulative former partner from his heist days. Seeing an opportunity to exploit Terrell's skills and past connections, Ray enlists Terrell's help for one last, potentially life-changing heist. Torn between loyalty to his old friend and his desire for redemption, Terrell is faced with a moral dilemma that could jeopardize the life he's trying to rebuild. As Terrell contemplates his decision, he meets Sarah, a kind-hearted and empathetic woman who runs a community outreach program for ex-convicts. Sensing the internal struggle Terrell is going through, she shares her own story of losing her brother to the criminal lifestyle and offers her guidance to keep him on the right path. As their friendship grows, Sarah's support and understanding become Terrell's motivation to stand up against the temptations of his old life. Terrell ultimately defies Ray's pressure and refuses to participate in the heist. Ray, feeling betrayed, becomes a looming threat bent on revenge. As the story unfolds, Terrell must navigate the dangers of his past, the anxieties of his present, and the hopes for his future. In doing so, he learns the meaning of self-forgiveness and discovers his own self-worth. In the climax, Terrell confronts Ray and prevents the heist from happening, leading to Ray's arrest. Knowing he's done the right thing, Terrell is finally able to let go of his past demons and look forward to a new chapter in his life. The Path to Redemption is a film that delves into the complexities of human choices, the power of forgiveness, and the potential for redemption we all hold within ourselves.

Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Every restaurant that advertises in any of these papers happens to have four stars in the handbook.","output":"To determine whether the given sentence is syntactically and semantically acceptable, let's break it down step by step and justify each step: 1. Analyzing the sentence structure: The sentence appears to have a clear subject (\\"Every restaurant\\") followed by relative clauses that provide additional information about the subject (\\"that advertises in any of these papers\\" and \\"happens to have four stars in the handbook\\"). The sentence follows a standard subject-verb-object structure and seems to be syntactically correct. 2. Assessing semantic acceptability: \\"Every restaurant\\" refers to a defined group of restaurants that meet the criteria specified in the sentence. The relative clause \\"that advertises in any of these papers\\" narrows down the set of restaurants to only include those that place ads in the mentioned papers. \\"Happens to have four stars in the handbook\\" adds another piece of information about the restaurants' rating in an unspecified handbook. The sentence conveys a concept that can be easily understood and seems to be semantically acceptable. It states that all restaurants advertising in the mentioned papers coincidentally have a four-star rating in the handbook.

Can we draw the following conclusion? William George \\"Billy\\" Zane, Jr. is sometimes referred to as America's greatest dramatic actor. OPT: 1). Yes; 2). It's impossible to say; 3). No;","output":"2). It's impossible to say While Billy Zane is a talented actor with a diverse range of roles to his name, it's impossible to definitively say that he is America's greatest dramatic actor. The title of \\"greatest dramatic actor\\" is highly subjective, and opinions on who deserves this accolade can vary greatly depending on individual preferences and experiences with different actors. Zane has been successful in a variety of projects and established a notable career in the film and television industry, but there are numerous other dramatic actors who have also made significant contributions to the art form. Some might argue that other actors, such as Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, or Denzel Washington, are more deserving of the title \\"America's greatest dramatic actor\\" based on their body of work and the numerous accolades they have received throughout their careers. There is no universally agreed-upon method for determining who is the greatest dramatic actor, as personal opinions and tastes differ, and the field of acting is constantly evolving. Factors such as an actor's versatility, critical acclaim, box office success, and contributions to the craft of acting all contribute to the ongoing debate. In conclusion, it's impossible to say whether or not Billy Zane is America's greatest dramatic actor, as there is no definitive set of criteria for making such a determination, and opinions on this matter are highly subjective and varied. It's perhaps more appropriate to recognize his talent and acknowledge his contributions to the field of acting without attempting to place him above or below other talented actors."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane.

Humanism: Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science (see the history of science in the Renaissance). This was despite what A. C. Crombie (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls \\"a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity\\", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the Aristotelian concentration on the observable properties of the physical world. But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), chairman of the subcommittee and a long-time champion of breaking space missions out of the Air Force.      \\"I am thrilled to have President Trump's continued support for this critical mission to help strengthen our national security,\\" Rogers said in a statement. \\"I look forward to working with the president to make this initiative a reality.\\"      Jerry Hendrix, a vice president at the defense consulting firm Telemus Group, pointed out it took more than 10 years for the Air Force to be separated from the Army in 1947.      So, establishing a Space Force is \\"a really steep hill to climb,\\" he said, but predicted the Trump administration could likely move it forward in as little as two years if it really pushed.      Defense officials still have to work out the details, like how the new service will be funded and who will staff it. And Hendrix predicted the money and personnel will largely come from the Air Force, which oversees the majority of Pentagon space missions, but that all services could be called on to contribute.      At the Pentagon, spokeswoman Dana White said the Defense Department will start work on a \\"deliberate process\\" to implement the president's order.      \\"We understand the president's guidance. Our Policy Board will begin working on this issue, which has implications for intelligence operations for the Air Force, Army, Marines and Navy,\\" White said in a statement. \\"Working with Congress, this will be a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders.\\"      During debate on the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill H.R. 2810 (115), Congress proposed creating a Space Corps within the Air Force, similar to how the Marine Corps resides within the Navy. But the measure failed to move forward, with lawmakers instead compromised by ordering the Pentagon to study how space should be organized within the Defense Department. The study is ongoing and a final report is due to Congress by the end of the year.      The House's version of the fiscal 2019 National Defense Authorization Act H.R. 5515 (115) proposes the creation of U.S. Space Command, as a subordinate combatant command under U.S. Strategic Command. It's unclear if this plan will survive the conference process with the Senate and end up in the final bill.      A stand-alone Space Force as a separate military service, which Trump proposed in March, is different from both of these congressional plans.      \\"Space is a war-fighting domain, just like the land air, and sea,\\" Trump told troops in California then. \\"We may even have a Space Force, develop another one, Space Force. We have the Air Force, we'll have the Space Force.\\"      Trump also announced the signing of a space policy directive Monday to make it easier for commercial companies to operate in space and mitigate the creation of more trash in orbit.      Space Policy Directive-3 “seeks to address the challenges of a congested space environment,” said Scott Pace, executive secretary of the National Space Council.      The document directs several federal agencies to act, including the Defense Department, which will continue to maintain an authoritative catalog of objects in space, and the Commerce Department, which will release information from that catalog to the public and help companies avoid collisions between assets in space.      \\"We are modernizing out-of-date space regulations — they're way out of date. They haven't been changed in many, many years,\\" the president said. \\"Today, we're taking one more step to unleash the power of American ingenuity.\\"      The directive also asks NASA to establish new guidelines to avoid the creation of new orbital debris and the State Department to work with international partners to put in place their own similar guidelines, as well as a space object registry.      It puts policy in place to back up the changes announced by Vice President Mike Pence in April, Pace said in a telephone briefing with reporters.      “It’s not going to happen overnight, but we’re getting everyone in their lanes and people pulling in the right direction,” he said.      The goal of the reforms is to ensure that companies can do business in space with sufficient knowledge about where space assets currently are. It also ensures they don’t have to contend with too much debris — which can make operating difficult or cause collisions in the worst case scenarios.      Pace said the effect of the directive on companies will hopefully be more rapid access to space traffic management information through a more “user-friendly” interface at the Commerce Department. It’ll also mean companies have to move their satellites out of the way of debris less often, he added, allowing them to conserve fuel to stay on mission longer.      This is the third Space Policy Directive coming from the president.      The first, which stated the national mission to return to the moon and focus on human exploration, came in December. The second, focused on cutting regulations on launch and commercial remote sensing, came in May.      Trump emphasized the need to partner with the commercial sector on space, but criticized one of the government's biggest space contractors, United Launch Alliance, for being a partnership between two defense giants: Boeing and Lockheed Martin.      \\"I don’t like when Boeing and Lockheed get together because the pricing only goes up, but that’s okay in this case,\\" Trump said while introducing United Launch Alliance CEO Tory Bruno. \\"I don’t know, I don’t love that stuff, we’re going to have to talk about that.\\"      \\"Stay apart, stay apart, don't get together,\\" he said while introducing the CEOs of Lockheed Martin, Marillyn Hewson and Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg.      United Launch Alliance was formed in 2006 by the two companies.

Trump emphasized that American dominance in space is a matter of national security. He tasked Joint Chiefs Chairman, Gen. Joseph Dunford, with standing up for the new military service. Trump's move faced backlash from several senators who claimed the president doesn't have the authority to unilaterally create a new military service without Congress's approval. They cited potential risks to existing Air Force missions and ongoing plans to study space's organization within the Department of Defense before evaluating what's best for national security. Some lawmakers, however, supported the move, such as Reps. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), both members of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee. The Pentagon has been tasked with implementing Trump's order after carrying out a \\"deliberate process\\" with input from multiple stakeholders. It remains to be seen how the new service will be funded and staffed. The establishment of a Space Force could take years, as defense officials continue to work through the details and historical precedence.

The modern English noun Greek (Old English Grecas or Crecas) is derived from the Latin Graeci, which in turn originates from Ancient Greek Graikos (Graikos). It seems that the word is related with the Greek word geron geron, \\"old man\\" (from the PIE base *gerh2-, \\"to grow old\\") via Proto-Greek *gera-, \\"old age\\"--also related to Mycenean Greek kera /geras/, \\"gift of honour\\". The Germanic languages borrowed the name with an initial k sound, which was probably their initial sound closest to the Latin g (Goth. Kreks).  Aristotle used the term Graikos related with Hellenes (Meteorologica I xiv) and claimed that it was the name originally used by the Illyrians for the Dorians in Epirus from Graii native name of the people of Epirus. He places Ancient Hellas in the region of Achelous river around Dodona where in his opinion the great deluge of Deucalion must have occurred. The priests of Zeus in Dodona were called Selloi which could lead to Sellanes (like Akarnanes) and then to Hellanes-Hellenes. However the toponyms and the Greek tradition indicate that it is more possible that the homeland of the Greeks was originally in central Greece and that the name was probably Pre-Dorian. A Greek legend is referring to an older deluge of Ogyges in Boeotia, in the region occupied by the Minyans which are considered autochthonous or Proto-Greek speaking people. The region outside of Attica including Boeotia was called Graike and the word Ogyges related with ocean came to mean \\"from earliest days.\\" Homer is referring to Hellenes as a relative small tribe in Phthia in central Greece (Achaea Pthiotis). In the Parian Chronicle is mentioned that Phthia was the homeland of Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Graikoi (Graikoi). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Deucalion (who ruled around Phthia) and Pyrrha, the only survivors after the great deluge. Hesiod is referring to Graecus son of Pandora, who was sister of Hellen. Alcman mentions that the mothers of Hellenes were Graikoi.  The German classical historian Georg Busolt (1850-1920) derives the name from Graikos,\\"inhabitant of Graea, a town on the coast of Boeotia. The name Graea (graia) is derived from Proto-Greek grau-j-, \\"old lady\\". Homer, while reciting the Boeotian forces in the Iliad's Catalogue of Ships, provides the first known reference to a region named Graea, and Pausanias mentions that the ancient city of Tanagra was for a time called Graea, adding that \\"no one knows where this Graia really was; Aristotle thought it was near Oropus, further east on the same coast as Delion.\\" Busolt claimed that the name was given by the Romans originally to the Greek colonists from Graea who helped to found Cumae the important city in southern Italy where the Latins first encountered the Greeks and then to all Greeks.  According to Rene Olivier, in the French language the word grec (Greek) is sometimes also used as an ethnic slur meaning fraudster (in contrast with hellenique which has no negative connotations).

The film's producer Andrew Gunn said he initially hoped Jodie Foster (who played Annabel in the original 1976 Freaky Friday film) would be interested in playing the mother in the remake. She declined in order to spend more time with her family and because of concerns that the stunt casting would overshadow the film's overall merit. Annette Bening was then cast in the role, but dropped out because of family obligations. Jamie Lee Curtis was given the role only four days before filming began. Lindsay Lohan's character was originally written as a Goth, but she did not think anyone would relate to that, and decided to dress in a preppy style for her audition. The character ended up being rewritten. Marc McClure, who played Boris Harris, Annabel's love interest in the original film, has a brief cameo as Boris the delivery man. Director Mark Waters also makes a cameo holding a baby at the wedding. In the end scene when Anna is dancing with Jake, there is a woman in the background dancing with an older gentleman, and she looks directly at the camera. That is Lindsay Lohan's mother, Dina Lohan.

Context: For the past few weeks I have been talking about the merits of the Mediterranean Diet. However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all.

I don't think shopping with women is fun, either. I often go shopping with my friends. It is fun. If I think a kind of shirt is fit for me, I think it is also fit for my friends. So I'd like them to think about buying the same things. My name is Sandy. I like shopping too. But I never go shopping on Saturdays or Sundays. There are a lot of people in the shops. I like shopping with my friends. I usually spend a lot of time choosing   things because I never buy the first thing I see. I always look around other shops to find the best price. I can find the best very well. I dislike buying food in small shops and street markets. I think food in the supermarket is very fresh and very cheap, so I like shopping there. When Tom shops with women or children, he thinks it is   _  . A) interesting or fun B) fun or hard C) happy or hard D) hard or not interesting Answer:","output":"D) hard or not interesting Step 1: Read and understand the question - We want to find out how Tom feels about shopping with women or children. Step 2: Analyze Tom's statement - According to Tom, shopping with young children is not an easy thing and he has to look after them. He also doesn't think shopping with women is fun. Step 3: Match the given options with Tom's experience - We need to choose the option that best represents Tom's experience of shopping with children and women. Option A) interesting or fun - Tom doesn't mention shopping with women or children being interesting or fun. Option B) fun or hard - Tom thinks shopping with women is not fun and finds shopping with children hard. Option C) happy or hard - Tom's statement doesn't suggest he's happy while shopping with women or children, but he does find it hard with children. Option D) hard or not interesting - This option matches Tom's experience since shopping with children is hard, and shopping with women is not fun (meaning it could be not interesting). So, the answer is option D) hard or not interesting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera. I didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off. Question: Why did the narrator try to flip off the camera?

One ordinary day, a captivating young woman named May stumbles upon Qiwu's street-corner workspace. Not only does she have a stunning appearance, but her personality is enchanting as well - a combination that captures Qiwu's attention like nothing else. Overcome with bashfulness, however, he struggles to strike up a conversation with her. During their brief meeting, Qiwu still manages to learn that May is an aspiring writer, currently working at a popular café to support her passion. She reveals to Qiwu that she's planning to go on a one-month sabbatical to finish her debut novel. Knowing she is leaving soon, Qiwu decides to muster the courage to ask May out on a date.

Question: suppose other internal changes underground happens, how will it affect MORE/GREATER eruptions.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's first consider the steps in the process of a volcanic eruption: 1. Magma rises from deep in the earth. 2. The magma goes into volcanos. 3. The volcanos pressure the magma upwards. 4. The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano. 5. The lava cools. 6. The lava forms new rock. 7. New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano. 8. The volcano bursts through the rock that formed after the last eruption. Now let's think about how other internal changes underground might affect the frequency or intensity of volcanic eruptions: A: More eruptions - If there are changes in underground processes that cause more magma to be generated or to rise more frequently, this could lead to more frequent eruptions. For example, increased tectonic activity might cause magma to rise and fill the volcano's chamber more quickly, leading to more frequent eruptions. B: Less eruptions - If the changes lead to a decrease in the amount of magma rising from deep in the earth or a decrease in the pressure pushing magma upwards, this could result in fewer or less intense eruptions. For example, if there is less tectonic activity or changes in the composition of magma that make it less likely to rise, the frequency of eruptions might decrease. C: No effect - Some changes in underground processes may not have a significant impact on the frequency or intensity of volcanic eruptions. For example, if the changes do not directly affect the generation, movement, or pressure of magma, it is possible that the number and intensity of eruptions would not be affected. Based on these considerations, I would choose Answer A: more eruptions as the most likely outcome of other internal changes underground affecting volcanic eruption frequency and intensity. However, it's important to remember that the actual impact of such changes would depend on the specific nature and scale of the changes in question."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? you wo n't feel like it 's wasted yours","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"you won't feel like it's wasted yours\\" can be described as chiefly positive.  Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves gauging the subjective information in a text segment and categorizing it – typically into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.  Here, it is very important to understand the context of the sentence. On analyzing the sentence at face value, one can infer that the speaker is assuring someone that their time or effort will not be perceived as wasted. This assurance could relay a positive sentiment because it communicates a level of respect or conscientiousness toward the listener's investment, whatever that might be (time, effort, resources, etc.). It suggests the presence of meaningful or valuable outcome in the context that would justify the input provided.  Therefore, in an overarching sense, the sentence carries a positive sentiment because it conveys hope, reassurance, or affirmation as perceived from the listener's perspective. The speaker is communicating an optimistic outcome or response in the existing context. Still, it's notable that sentiment detection can sometimes vary based on detailed contextual cues, cultural nuances, deeper pragmatics, or other variables. But based on the given sentence and absent any other contextual insights, we can reasonably deduce it as positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, in addition to that have always trusted & respected Danny Glovers taste in his choice of roles, \\"Grand Canyon\\" for example. I just could not finish this movie, after what seemed an eternity, but was probably just a little over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited, confusing, and unnecessary. What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama & not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I love to watch white people freak out & start acting like complete idiots, it makes me laugh) became a waste of my 1 credit at the video store.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how a vul works Suggested answer: With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out. Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"No, the suggested answer is not accurate for describing how a Variable Universal Life (VUL) insurance policy works. The correct explanation for how a VUL works is as follows: A Variable Universal Life (VUL) insurance policy is a type of permanent life insurance that combines elements of both whole life and universal life insurance with added flexibility and investment options. It provides a death benefit to beneficiaries, as well as a cash value component that can be invested in various sub-accounts or funds with potential for growth. Here are the main components of a VUL policy: 1. Premium Payments: Policyholders have the flexibility to pay premiums at their discretion. However, there is usually a minimum required premium to keep the policy active. Premiums paid in excess of the cost of insurance and administrative fees will go into the policy's cash value component. 2. Death Benefit: The death benefit is the amount paid to beneficiaries in the event of the policyholder's death. There are typically two options for the death benefit – a fixed face amount or a face amount plus the cash value component. 3. Cash Value Component: This is the investment portion of the VUL policy. The cash value can be invested in various sub-accounts or funds, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. These investments come with an inherent level of market risk, and their performance will directly impact the cash value. Policyholders can also borrow or withdraw from the cash value, but this may affect the death benefit. 4. Flexible Premiums and Death Benefits: Policyholders have the flexibility to adjust premium payments and the death benefit within certain limits, depending on the policy's performance and the policyholder's financial needs. In summary, a VUL policy offers more flexibility and investment options compared to a typical whole life policy, but it may also come with additional risks due to the variable market performance of the investment component."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There is a sizeable Polish population in the city, with estimates as high as 20,000. Now answer this question: What nationality of people makes up a large portion of Southampton residents?","output":"Southampton, a city located on the southern coast of England, is home to a diverse population. Based on the data provided in the article, which estimates the city's population to be around 236,900 in 2011, it can be deduced that a significant portion of Southampton residents are of Polish nationality.  The sizeable Polish community in Southampton is estimated to have reached as high as 20,000 individuals, making them a notable demographic within the city's population. The presence of this large Polish group can be attributed to various factors, including historical events, economic opportunities, and social networks. Since World War II, a significant number of Poles have immigrated to the United Kingdom, seeking refuge, stability, and better living conditions. Particularly after Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004, the freedom of movement facilitated a considerable wave of Polish migrants seeking job opportunities in the UK. Southampton, with its bustling economy and seaport, has been an attractive destination for many Polish nationals. The strong Polish influence in Southampton is evident through the cultural establishments, businesses, and events that cater to the Polish community. Polish food shops, bars, and schools can be found in the city, along with community events such as the annual Polish Heritage Day, which celebrates and fosters connections between the Polish community and other residents in the area.  In summary, the Polish nationality makes up a large portion of Southampton residents, with as many as 20,000 Polish individuals living within the city. The significant presence of this community can be attributed to historical migration patterns, economic opportunities, and the thriving Polish culture in the area."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Tässä on englanninkielinen teksti käännettynä suomeksi: Haluaisin kiittää Euroopan parlamenttia tästä keskustelusta, joka käsittelee erittäin tärkeää aihetta nimittäin ympäristötarkastuksia. Ympäristötarkastukset ovat keskeinen osa tehokasta ympäristöpolitiikkaa ja laadunvalvontaa, minkä vuoksi on tärkeää, että tämä aihe saa ansaitsemansa huomion Euroopan parlamentissa. Ympäristötarkastukset auttavat varmistamaan, että ympäristölainsäädäntöä noudatetaan ja että ympäristöä kohdellaan kestävällä ja vastuullisella tavalla. Ne ovat myös tärkeä keino ehkäistä ja havaita väärinkäytöksiä ja riskejä, jotka voivat aiheutua ihmisten toiminnasta ympäristölle. Tällaisia riskejä voivat olla esimerkiksi vaarallisten aineiden päästöt, maaperän ja vesistöjen saastuminen sekä luonnonvarojen ylikäyttö ja lajien sukupuuttoon kuoleminen. Euroopan parlamentin rooli on valvoa ja ohjata EU:n toimielinten ja jäsenvaltioiden ympäristöpolitiikan toteuttamista, mukaan lukien ympäristötarkastusten käyttöönottoa ja kehittämistä. Sen vuoksi on ensiarvoisen tärkeää, että parlamentti keskustelee siitä, miten ympäristötarkastukset voidaan ottaa kattavammin ja tehokkaammin käyttöön koko EU:n alueella. Parlamentti voi esimerkiksi keskustella ja tehdä ehdotuksia siitä, kuinka ympäristötarkastusten resursseja ja koulutusta voidaan parantaa jäsenvaltioissa, sekä siitä, millaisia yhteistyömekanismeja ja tiedonvaihtoa voitaisiin kehittää eri toimijoiden välille. Lisäksi parlamentti voi vaikuttaa siihen, kuinka heikkoja kohtia, kuten petoksia ja väärinkäytöksiä, voitaisiin torjua tehokkaammin ympäristötarkastusten avulla. Toivottavasti tämä keskustelu auttaa luomaan entistä vahvempaa yhteistyötä ja yhteisymmärrystä ympäristötarkastusten merkityksestä ja siitä, kuinka niitä voidaan kehittää ja hyödyntää EU:n ympäristöpolitiikan täytäntöönpanossa. Sen myötä voimme edistää yhdessä kestävämpää tulevaisuutta ja varmistaa, että ympäristöarvojamme suojellaan parhaalla mahdollisella tavalla."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the rest of the story on Guardian News Added January 20, 2017 from Guardian News Can we infer the following? He stepped down after being president for 28 years","output":"The story suggests that Yahya Jammeh has stepped down as the president of The Gambia, making way for Adama Barrow to assume office. It is important to note that Yahya Jammeh was a long-term leader in The Gambia, allowing us to infer that he served as president for a substantial period. However, the specific duration of his presidency is not provided in the given text. To provide a more accurate and detailed response, Yahya Jammeh served as the President of The Gambia from 1994 to 2017. He originally came into power after leading a successful military coup in July 1994, which ousted then-president Dawda Jawara. Jammeh's time in office spanned over 22 years, during which his rule was characterized by accusations of human rights abuses, suppression of political dissent, and electoral malpractices. During the December 2016 presidential election, the opposition leader Adama Barrow emerged as the winner. Initially, Jammeh conceded defeat and congratulated Barrow on his victory. However, he later reversed his decision, claiming that the electoral process was marred by irregularities. This led to a political crisis in the country, with international pressure mounting on Jammeh to accept the results and step down. The situation escalated when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a regional bloc of which The Gambia is a member, intervened and deployed military forces to ensure a smooth transition of power. Diplomatic efforts were also intensified, leading to the involvement of several presidents from neighboring countries that engaged in negotiations with Jammeh. These combined efforts eventually convinced him to step down on January 20, 2017. This marked the end of Jammeh's rule and allowed the internationally recognized President, Adama Barrow, to take over. In conclusion, while the specific duration of Jammeh's presidency is not provided in the text, a comprehensive examination of his time in office reveals that he served as the leader of The Gambia for approximately 22 years."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The instructions stated that she'd need the jello mix, one cup of boiling water, and one cup of cold water. Step 3: Boil water Christine filled a pot with water and turned on the stove to bring it to a boil. As the water heated up, she observed the temperature closely to ensure it was a perfect rolling boil. Step 4: Mix the jello powder with boiling water Once the water boiled, Christine carefully measured out one cup of the boiling water and poured it into the mixing bowl. Next, she slowly added the strawberry flavored jello mix and began stirring it with the spoon. She continued stirring until the powder was fully dissolved.

Given the question: In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC. How did editor Furtok feel about the disappointed father to didn't get in the program? - He empathized with the parent. - not enough information - He felt frustrated that everyone couldn't be accepted. - He was angry because of the insult The answer is:","output":"He was angry because of the insult. Step 1: Read and understand the question and the given passage. In this question, we are asked about the emotions of editor Furtok when the disappointed father made a comment about the school's admissions results.  Step 2: Identify relevant information in the passage that helps answer the question. The passage mentioned that a disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, which is an insult. Step 3: Analyze the response of editor Furtok. Following the insult, editor Furtok hit the disappointed father in the face. Step 4: Determine editor Furtok's emotions based on his response.  Considering that editor Furtok reacted with physical violence after hearing the insult, it can be inferred that he was angry because of the insult."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -8*l = 3*l + 55 for l, we need to isolate the variable l on one side of the equation. Here's the step-by-step solution: Step 1: Move all terms with the variable l to one side of the equation. To do this, we can add 8*l to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -8*l term on the left side and move all the l terms to the right side. The equation becomes: -8*l + 8*l = 3*l + 55 + 8*l Which simplifies to: 0 = 3*l + 8*l + 55 Step 2: Combine the l terms on the right side of the equation. 3*l and 8*l have the same variable, so we can combine them. The equation becomes: 0 = 11*l + 55 Step 3: Move the constant term to the other side of the equation. Now we want to isolate the term with the variable (11*l) by moving the constant term (55) to the other side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 55 from both sides: 0 - 55 = 11*l + 55 - 55 Which simplifies to: -55 = 11*l Step 4: Solve for l. Finally, we want to find the value of l by dividing both sides of the equation by 11: -55 / 11 = (11*l) / 11 This simplifies to: -5 = l So the solution to the equation -8*l = 3*l + 55 is l = -5."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Attorneys... (Associated Press)      The fatal shooting of Jones, 55, and 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, a college student visiting his father for the holiday, at a West Side home has raised further questions about a police department already under intense scrutiny. Grieving relatives and friends of the two victims gathered Sunday to remember them and criticize city officials who they said had once again failed residents.      The shooting happened early Saturday morning at the small two-story home, where Jones lived in a ground-floor apartment and LeGrier's father in an upstairs unit. Police, who were responding to a 911 call made by LeGrier's father after an argument with his son, have released few details beyond a brief statement.      It said that officers \\"were confronted by a combative subject resulting in the discharging of the officer's weapon\\" and added that Jones \\"was accidentally struck.\\"      Both Jones and LeGrief were black, and their deaths come amid scrutiny of police after a series of deaths of African-Americans at the hands of officers across the country gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. It also comes amid a federal civil rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department that was launched after last month's release of police dashcam video showing white officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in 2014.      Police did not disclose the race of the officer or officers, saying only that those involved will be placed on administrative duties.      LeGrier's mother, Janet Cooksey, during a vigil Sunday placed candles on the porch of the home. On either side of the door, Post-It notes indicated where two bullets hit siding on the house.      \\"I used to watch the news daily and I would grieve for other mothers, other family members, and now today I'm grieving myself,\\" Cooksey said at a news conference outside the residence earlier Sunday.      Others who spoke said police should have used stun guns or other nonlethal methods if they felt they needed to subdue LeGrier.      \\"Why do (police) have to shoot first and ask questions later?\\" Jacqueline Walker, a friend of Jones, asked. \\"It's ridiculous.\\"      Family spokesman Eric Russell said Jones' many grandchildren had hoped to thank her for their Christmas gifts over the weekend.      Autopsy findings released Sunday by the Cook County medical examiner's office say Jones died from a gunshot to the chest and LeGrier from multiple gunshot wounds.      Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi on Sunday said only that the shootings are being investigated by the city's Independent Police Review Authority, the main police oversight agency.      LeGrier's cousin, Albert Person, said LeGrier's father had invited his son to a holiday gathering at another home on Christmas. Person said the son's refusal to go caused friction, but he downplayed the severity of the argument.      \\"What family doesn't fight on the holidays?\\" he said.      LeGrier's father, Antonio LeGrier, told the Chicago Sun-Times his son appeared to be a \\"little agitated\\" when the father returned to the apartment. Around 4:15 a.m., the elder LeGrier said he heard loud banging on his locked bedroom door and that his son said, \\"You're not going to scare me.\\" He said his son tried to bust the door open, but he kept him from doing so and called police. He added that he called Jones on the floor below to say his son was a \\"little irate\\" and not to open the door unless police arrived.      He said Jones told him his son was outside with a baseball bat. Person said the teen was back in the house by the time police arrived.      When they did arrive, Antonio LeGrier said he heard Jones yell, \\"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\\" He said he heard gunshots as he made his way down from the second floor and then saw his son and Jones lying in the foyer.      He said his son had emotional problems after spending most of his childhood in foster care. He described him as a \\"whiz kid\\" on break from Northern Illinois University, where he majored in electrical engineering technology.      Cooksey denied that her son ever exhibited \\"combative behavior.\\" She said he \\"might've been angry with his father and they might've got into it,\\" but that he was not angry or violent.      It's not clear whether Jones tried to intervene before being shot or if she was hit by gunfire while answering the door.      Sam Adam Jr., a lawyer for the Jones family, said Jones and LeGrier were apparently shot near the doorway of the home, but that shell casings were found some 20 feet away. He said that raised questions about whether police could have perceived LeGrier as a threat at such a distance.      It couldn't be independently verified that the casings had any link to Saturday's shooting.      Adam also said police took the hard drive of a home-security camera from across the street, but it was unknown if it or other cameras in the neighborhood captured the shootings.      Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office said in a statement Saturday that IPRA would share its evidence with the county prosecutor's office.      \\"Anytime an officer uses force the public deserves answers, and regardless of the circumstances, we all grieve anytime there is a loss of life in our city,\\" Emanuel said in the statement. ||||| As questions grow about a police-involved shooting where a 55-year-old bystander was killed, the City of Chicago announced what the mayor’s office called “two significant policy steps,” related to police shootings and procedures for interceding in domestic violence situations. NBC 5's Phil Rogers reports. (Published Monday, Dec 28, 2015)      As questions grow about a police-involved shooting where a 55-year-old bystander was killed, the City of Chicago announced what the mayor’s office called “two significant policy steps,” related to police shootings and procedures for interceding in domestic violence situations.      Saturday morning, 55-year-old Bettie Jones was shot and killed in a flurry of gunfire directed at a 19-year-old-man armed with a baseball bat at a two story home on Chicago’s west side. That man, Quentonio LeGrier, also died, shot seven times.      “She didn’t do anything to nobody,” said Jones’ daughter Latisha. “All she did was answer her front door!”      Chicago Police have given few details about the incident, saying that the officers were responding to a 911 call made by LeGrier’s father, after an argument with his son. Police said in a statement, that arriving officers were confronted by a “combative subject resulting in the discharging of the officer’s weapon,” and that “the female victim was accidentally struck.”      “I feel like I just want to wake up and have my mom say, ‘Girl, that was a dream,’” said Jones daughter Latarsha. “But I can’t. She’s gone. She was murdered.”      Effective immediately, the city says officers involved in shootings will be removed from street duty for a minimum of 30 days while those shootings are investigated.      “I was really pleased to see that,” said Sharon Fairley, the acting chief of the Independent Police Review Authority, the agency responsible for investigating police shootings. “I definitely think that’s a step in the right direction.”      Fairley acknowledged public dissatisfaction with the length of time many police shooting investigations can take. But she defended her agency’s work, saying it was most important that those investigations were done correctly.      “These matters are always serious,” she said. “These investigations can be extremely complex, and there can be valid reasons that they can be extended in time.”      At the same time, Fairly acknowledged that she is stepping into leadership at IPRA, at a time when public outrage over police shootings may be at an all-time high.      “It’s a lot of pressure, there’s no question,” she said. “Stepping into this job at this time in this firestorm, it certainly isn’t easy. But I have to put all that aside and focus on the work and getting the work done.”      Attorney Sam Adam Jr., who represents Jones’ family, questioned why it was necessary for police to fire at a subject armed only with a baseball bat.      “The shell casings, many of them, are found down by the street on the sidewalk, which would suggest that is at least 25 feet away,” Adam said.      In an obvious reference to the domestic investigation where the two were shot early Saturday morning, the mayor’s office announced in a statement Monday that the city would embark on a complete review of crisis intervention policies.      “The Mayor has called on them to determine the deficiencies in the current training or policies,” that statement said, “and outline what steps can be taken immediately to address them.”      Emanuel’s office announced Monday he was cutting a Cuban vacation short, to return to Chicago and manage the latest crisis confronting his Police Department. Fairley would not comment specifically about the investigation into the Saturday morning shootings, emphasizing instead, that she has embarked in a top to bottom review of her agency and its investigations into allegations of police wrongdoing.      “I’m not about finger pointing,” she said. “What I’m focused on, is how are we going to fix it? What are the policies and procedures and training that we can put in place, to get the ship going in the right direction?” ||||| A definitive statement from the Chicago Police Department about an officer's fatal shooting of two people — one by accident — came Saturday night, 16 hours after the incident.      But when it did arrive, the comments from interim Superintendent John Escalante were notable. In the late-evening press release, Escalante not only announced a major policy shift on returning officers to duty after a shooting, he also took the unusual step to acknowledge that an innocent victim had been hit by an errant police bullet.      \\"The 55-year-old female victim was accidentally struck and tragically killed,\\" the statement read. \\"The department extends its deepest condolences to the victim's family and friends.\\"      In contrast, the 2012 department statement on the fatal shooting of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd, who was also an unintended target of a police shooting, simply noted that a female had \\"sustained a gunshot wound.\\"      Both the policy announcement and Escalante's condolences reflect the emerging reality for the Chicago Police Department in the wake of last month's release of video of a white police officer fatally shooting an African-American teen. The disturbing 2014 dash-cam video showed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald carrying a pocket knife and walking away from Officer Jason Van Dyke, who shot 16 rounds at the teen within seconds of arriving at the scene and now faces first-degree murder charges.      The video, which was released only after a judge's order, has led to swift — even dizzying — changes. The U.S. Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into excessive force. Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy was fired, and the head of the independent agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct was forced out. Mayor Rahm Emanuel publicly apologized.      The shooting about 4:30 a.m. Saturday in the 4700 block of West Erie Street was the department's first lethal use of force since the McDonald video was released, providing a glimpse of how it is responding to the biggest crisis of Emanuel's tenure in office.      Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Sunday that Escalante and his command staff had started working on the policy change a week and a half ago. But in the wake of learning details from the West Side shooting, Escalante insisted the statement acknowledge the accidental killing of Bettie Jones, Guglielmi said.      Chicago police fatally shot Quintonio LeGrier, 19, and Bettie Jones, 55, as officers responded to a domestic disturbance at a West Garfield Park residence Dec. 26, 2015, authorities said.      \\"It was a tragic loss of life. The superintendent was adamant that the department express our deepest condolences,\\" Guglielmi said. \\"... The climate we are in is causing us to look at this. We are really trying to make the department better.\\"      In the Saturday shooting on Erie, Harrison District officers were responding to a domestic violence call of a man wielding a bat.      Police shot and killed Quintonio LeGrier, a 19-year-old engineering student, after he became combative with them, the Chicago police statement said. During the altercation, Bettie Jones, 55, a mother of five who lived downstairs from LeGrier's father, was shot and killed by accident.      Hours after the West Side incident, Chicago police were involved in yet another shooting, though this one nonfatal. At 1:30 p.m. in the 1000 block of West 103rd Place, officers confronted a man with a gun, leading one officer to open fire, wounding the man.      Such confrontations with the public are the focus of the Justice Department civil rights investigation, which was announced earlier this month by U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch.      The probe will include a detailed examination of how and when officers use force in the department, as well as how the city investigates the incidents.      The investigation was prompted by the McDonald shooting but comes after years of civil lawsuits against the department and outcries from the public over police-involved shootings.      The review is expected to be lengthy, taking at least a year, and will likely lead to a court-enforced consent decree demanding systemic reforms. Recommended changes could cover anything from training to how firearm discharges are recorded and documented in the department.      But Chicago doesn't have to wait for the Justice Department review to address problems, and Escalante has already made some moves aimed at restoring public confidence.      Soon after Escalante took over as interim superintendent, he announced a policy change on dashboard cameras. Because there was missing audio in the dashboard cameras from responding vehicles the night of McDonald's shooting, Escalante has sent out inspectors on random checks to see if the dash cams are working property. If an inspector finds that an officer didn't tell a supervisor about a faulty camera, that officer could be disciplined.      Then on Saturday night, the interim superintendent announced another policy change: Officers involved in shootings will be shifted to mandatory administrative duty, returning to their assigned bureau for desk duty for 30 days. The new policy includes the officer or officers involved in Saturday's shooting, according to the police statement.      That is a big shift from the current policy in which officers generally had three days to see a counselor and be cleared for return to duty unless it was determined that they need more time off. Officers were also required to report for a one-day retraining at the academy — though that could happen after they returned to duty.      During the newly established 30-day period, the officer will be required to attend the training class at the academy, commanding officers will monitor and evaluate if the officer is prepared to return to street duties, and the officer will have to see a department counselor.      Guglielmi said Escalante reviewed other cities' departments and settled on the 30 days because \\"it seemed like a fair amount of time to get all those objectives done.\\"      Providing officers with time off following a shooting is not unusual. It is considered essential to making sure an officer is coping with any psychological issues in the aftermath of the incident and is getting whatever support he or she needs. Getting the proper help for officers is not an easy task in a profession where admitting weakness has historically been frowned upon. ||||| Tensions remain high in Chicago after police shot and killed two people early Saturday morning, with the force already faces heightened scrutiny overs its practices.      Janet Cooksey says her 19-year-old son, Quintonio LeGrier, was a college honors student studying engineering who recently had been dealing with some mental health issues, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.      Family members reportedly called police to their home Saturday because the teen was threatening his father with a baseball bat. Detectives described LeGrier as being \\"combative\\" before he was shot.      \\"I used to watch the news daily and I would grieve for other mothers, other family members, and now today I'm grieving myself,\\" said Janet Cooksey, LeGrier's mother. \\"When do it come to an end?\\"      Fifty-five-year-old Bettie Jones, a mother of five, lived in the same building. She was reportedly waiting for police to respond, then got shot along with LeGrier.      Police admitted she was quote \\"accidentally struck and tragically killed.\\"      \\"Right now is a time for compassion towards the suffering of families that are experiencing injustices throughout our city,\\" Jahmal Cole, a Jones relative, said Sunday at a press conference.      The frustration felt by this community comes amid protests over a string of deadly police shootings.      Video released recently showed the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, shot by officer Jason Van Dyke 16 times in October of 2014. The officer faces criminal charges.      On Sunday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel called for a review of how police are trained to respond to mental health issues in a crisis.      But family, friends and local religious leaders holding a vigil for LeGrier and Jones were critical of Emanuel's efforts - some now even asking for intervention from the White House.      \\"We hope to hear from the president, President Obama -- we are under siege,\\" said Pastor Ira Acree of the Greater St. John Bible Church.      This incident was one of two separate police-involved shooting incidents Saturday. Chicago's independent police review board is investigating both, while the Justice Department continues to investigate whether the Chicago police use excessive force appropriately. |||||","output":"The fatal shooting of Bettie Jones and 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier in Chicago has raised further questions about a police department already under intense scrutiny. Grieving relatives and friends of the two victims gathered on Sunday to remember them and criticize city officials who they said had once again failed residents. The shooting comes amid a federal civil rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department that was launched after last month's release of police dashcam video showing white officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in 2014. As questions grow about a police-involved shooting where a 55-year-old bystander (Jones) was killed, the City of Chicago announced what the mayor’s office called “two significant policy steps,” related to police shootings and procedures for interceding in domestic violence situations. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office said in a statement the shootings are being investigated by the city's Independent Police Review Authority."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Write a title for this article: 03/02/2016 AT 05:20 PM EST On Wednesday, less than 24 hours after being indicted on charges that he conspired to rig bids on oil and natural gas leases, the former CEO for Oklahoma-based oil and gas giant Chesapeake Energy died in a fiery single-car crash, PEOPLE confirms. An Oklahoma City Police Department spokeswoman tells PEOPLE Aubrey McClendon, 56, was driving his 2013 Chevy Tahoe at a \\"high rate of speed\\" Wednesday morning when the vehicle left the roadway, colliding head-on with a wall. Police believe McClendon died instantly, but claim it is too early to tell if the accident was intentional. (McClendon was part-owner of the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder.) \\"We need to wait for the results of his autopsy before we can comment on motivation,\\" the spokeswoman says. \\"The accident could have been caused by a medical episode.\\" Photos from the accident scene indicate McClendon's car burst into flames upon impact, the spokeswoman says. The accident is still under investigation, she says. According to Tuesday's indictment, McClendon allegedly orchestrated a conspiracy between two large oil and gas companies to not bid against each other for the purchase of certain oil and natural gas leases in northwest Oklahoma. During this alleged conspiracy, which ran from December 2007 to March 2012, authorities say McClendon and his alleged co-conspirators would decide ahead of time who would win the leases. The winning bidder would then allegedly allocate an interest in the leases to the other company. \\"While serving as CEO of a major oil and gas company, the defendant formed and led a conspiracy to suppress prices paid to leaseholders in northwest Oklahoma,\\" said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer in a statement. \\"His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land.

A former goverment official named Straker (James Wainwright), leading a group of former soldiers (accompanied by his daughter Corlie) find a vast supply of diesel fuel in a compound once thought to be radioactive. Straker and his group travel in a large, heavily armored \\"battle truck\\" which is armed with heavy machine guns, and a howitzer. When Corlie refuses to execute the previous owners, she runs away from base camp.A foraging man known only as Hunter (Michael Beck), is traveling the desolate landscape on his amazing (possibly ex-future-military?) motorcycle, rescues the girl and takes her to his farm. After keeping her on the farm on a temporary basis, Hunter sends her off to live in a walled city (known in-film as Clearwater Farm) governed by a strict old-fashioned democracy (similar to the Quakers) where she is quickly accepted by the community. However, she is soon discovered by the mercenaries commanded by her father, Colonel Straker, who moves to attack the Clearwater using the \\"battle truck\\". In the chaos that ensues, Corlie manages to escape back to Hunter's remote hideout. Straker terrorizes the residents of Clearwater, taking their weapons, medicines, and other supplies and handing the women over to his men.Within a short time, one of the residents of Clearwater betrays the Clearwater mechanic/fabricator, Rusty, who knows the secret location of Hunter's hideout. Straker and company use toture to get the info from poor Rusty, then move in to attack Hunter's base and recapture Corlie. Hunter and Corlie escape on his bike. Straker, in a minor rage, plows through Hunter's place with the truck.Hunter takes Corlie back to the Clearwater people and asks Rusty to build him an armored car to attack Straker's battle truck.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"The statement you provided is a mixture of two unrelated processes - the life cycle of a butterfly and sediment transportation by wind and water. Let's first clarify each process separately. Butterfly Life Cycle: 1. A larva (caterpillar) is born. 2. The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger. 3. The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon (chrysalis) around itself. 4. The caterpillar becomes a pupa inside the cocoon. 5. After some time, the cocoon hatches. 6. An adult butterfly emerges. Sediment Transportation: Sediments are particles of rock, minerals, or organic material that are transported by natural agents like wind, water, or glaciers. If sediment is not picked up by wind or water, it means that the sediment will not be transported from one location to another. With these processes clarified, it should be easier to understand your question. The perturbation you mentioned is related to sediment transportation and has no direct or indirect impact on the life cycle of a butterfly. Therefore, the correct answer from the given options is: - not impacting any step of the process This is because sediment transportation is a geological process, whereas the butterfly life cycle is a biological process. While it's possible that cocoon formation and sediment transportation may co-occur in the same ecosystem, they do not influence each other in a way that would impact the steps in the butterfly's life cycle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While we know that the airport currently does not have any taxiways other than the one leading to the terminal building, the provided information does not mention any plans for future development or expansion of the airport's infrastructure. In order to determine if the statement follows the preceding text, more information would be needed about any plans for construction or renovation at Diqing Shangri-La Airport. It is essential to know if the airport authorities have announced any plans to build additional taxiways or address the current backtaxi situation, as well as whether the necessary funding and regulatory approvals have been secured.

When a mysterious attacker, Chan, wages a relentless cat-and-mouse game against Dredd, it puts the entire city in peril as the two adversaries uncover a deadly conspiracy. Act 1: The film opens with a high-speed chase through the ever-bustling Mega-City One, a massive metropolis that covers almost the entire eastern seaboard of the United States. Judge Dredd, the city's most feared law enforcer, is pursuing a well-known arms dealer. The criminal is subdued with merciless efficiency, and the people of the city breathe a sigh of relief. With the status quo restored, Dredd returns to the Hall of Justice to report his success. Act 2: Meanwhile, in the dark underbelly of the city, a mysterious figure lurks, studying Dredd's movements and patterns. This shadowy being harbors an unparalleled hatred for the elite Judge and meticulously plans his attack. Soon, the stranger, known only as Chan, reveals himself to be a genetically superior assassin, capable of out-smarting and out-fighting Dredd. Chan's relentless attacks on Dredd and brutal acts against the citizens of Mega-City One leave the Judges crippled and frightened. As their power wanes and panic envelops the city, a task force led by Judge Anderson, an empathic psychic judge, is assigned to track Chan down. Act 3: In an unexpected twist, Dredd discovers traces of manipulation deep within the Hall of Justice. The investigation leads to the exposure of a high-ranking judge who has been secretly orchestrating the incidents in an attempt to seize control of the city and establish a new governing order. The revelation forces Dredd and Anderson to ally themselves with Chan. Act 4: The climax begins with a heated battle between Dredd, Anderson, and Chan against the corrupted Judicatory forces. As they fight their way through the once hallowed halls, Dredd and Chan form a mutual respect for one another, in spite of their past vendettas. They eventually come to confront the supreme antagonist, the high-ranking judge, unveiling a ruthless and twisted plot that affects not only the city but many others. In an explosive finale, Dredd, alongside Anderson and Chan, eliminates the threat posed by the rogue judge and dismantles the deep-rooted conspiracy that shakes Mega-City One to its core. Act 5: With the city saved and the corrupt judge brought to justice, Dredd and Chan begrudgingly exchange glances and nods of respect before parting ways. Anderson, still wary of Chan, warns him that she will be watching him closely. As Chan solemnly leaves the city, Dredd and Anderson contemplate the events, knowing that they must work together to rebuild the city and restore the public's faith. This dramatic film confronts themes of power, betrayal, honor, and redemption, offering a new perspective on a struggle between a classic comic book character and a complex new enemy, all enveloped within an intriguing suspenseful thriller."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Szekely (born September 12, 1967), better known by his stage name Louis C.K. (), is an American stand-up comedian, writer, actor, and filmmaker. He is known for his use of observational, self-deprecating, dark, and shock humor. In 2012, C.K. won a Peabody Award and has received six Primetime Emmy Awards, as well as numerous awards for The Chris Rock Show, Louie, and his stand-up specials Live at the Beacon Theater (2011) and Oh My God (2013). He has won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album twice. In August 2005, C.K. starred in a half-hour HBO special as part of the stand-up series One Night Stand. Inspired by the work ethic of fellow comedian George Carlin, who had committed to dropping all of his existing material and starting over every year, In June 2006, C.K. starred in and wrote Lucky Louie, a sitcom he created. The series premiered on HBO and was videotaped in front of a studio audience; it was HBO's first series in that format. Lucky Louie is described as a bluntly realistic portrayal of family life. HBO canceled the series after its first season. He appeared in three films in 2008: Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins, Diminished Capacity, and Role Models. C.K. launched his first hour-long special, Shameless, in 2007, which aired on HBO and was later released on DVD. In March 2008, he recorded a second hour-long special, Chewed Up, which premiered on Showtime Network on October 4, 2008, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy or Variety Special.  C.K. and his wife Alix Bailey divorced in 2008, with C.K. and Bailey sharing joint custody of their children. In a 2010 interview, C.K. talked about how, after his divorce, he thought, \\"well, there goes my act.\\" He alluded to the way that his marriage had been central to his act and his life, and he said that it took him approximately a year to realize \\"I'm accumulating stories here that are worth telling.\\" One element in his preparation for stand-up was training at the same boxing gym as Lowell, Massachusetts fighter Micky Ward, trying to \\"learn how to ... do the grunt work and the boring, constant training so that you'll be fit enough to take the beating.\\"  On April 18, 2009, C.K. recorded a concert film titled Hilarious. Unlike his previous specials--which had all been produced for television networks--Hilarious was produced independently, directed by C.K. himself, and sold to Epix and Comedy Central after it was complete. As a result, it was not released until late 2010. It was published on DVD and CD in 2011. It is the first stand-up comedy film accepted into the Sundance Film Festival. From 2009 to 2012, C.K. played Dave Sanderson, a police officer and ex-boyfriend of Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) in the sitcom Parks and Recreation. He also co-starred in the romantic comedy fantasy film The Invention of Lying, directed by and starring Ricky Gervais, in 2009.

Pick the answer from these options Possible answers:  -Change the data to support the hypothesis.;  -Perform the experiment without using control groups.;  -Make observations and form another testable hypothesis.;  -Perform the experiment using a larger number of variables.;","output":"The most appropriate step to take when an experiment results in data that do not support the hypothesis is to make observations and form another testable hypothesis. When the data obtained from an experiment does not support the initial hypothesis, it typically indicates that the hypothesis may not accurately describe or explain the phenomenon being studied. It is essential to maintain scientific integrity and honesty by acknowledging that the original hypothesis might need revision, rather than attempting to manipulate the data or experiment design to force a desired outcome. In such cases, researchers should carefully analyze the data and the experimental process to identify any potential flaws in the methodology or any additional factors that may have influenced the results. By making observations based on the data obtained and the underlying scientific principles, they can then formulate a new, testable hypothesis that better accounts for the observed phenomena. Once a new hypothesis has been formed, the next step is to design another experiment to test it. This may involve modifying the experimental design, redefining the variables or stimuli used, or revisiting assumptions made during the initial hypothesis formation. It is important to learn from previous experiments and to refine approaches in light of the new information. In conclusion, when experimental data does not support a hypothesis, the most suitable course of action is to make observations based on the obtained data and form another testable hypothesis. This approach ensures that the scientific process remains objective, rigorous, and focused on uncovering true understanding of the natural world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It had not rained in almost a month. The crops were dying. Cows had stopped giving milk. If it did not rain soon, we would lose everything. On this day, I witnessed  a wonder. I was making lunch when I saw my 6-year-old son, Billy, walking very slowly toward the woods. Minutes later he came running out again, toward the house. Soon after, I saw him walking toward the woods again. This went on for an hour. Finally I walked out of the house quietly and followed him. Billy cupped both hands in front of him as he walked, careful not to drop the water he carried. Leaves slapped his face but he kept walking into the woods. Then I saw an amazing sight. Several large deer stood in front of him. Billy walked right up to them. I saw a tiny baby deer lying on the ground. It was dying of thirst, and it lifted its head with great effort to drink the water in my boy's hands. When the water was gone, Billy ran back to the house. I followed him to the tap. Billy opened it and a small trickle  came out. He knelt down, letting the drops slowly fill up his \\"cup\\". Now I understood what was going on. The week before, he tried giving water to our horses but I told him not to waste water. Now when he stood up and turned, I was there in front of him. His eyes filled with tears, \\"I'm not wasting,\\" he said. I joined him with a small pot of water from the kitchen. I let him walk to the baby deer alone while I stood at the edge of the woods. As tears rolled down my face, they were suddenly joined by other drops... and more drops... as if the sky itself was crying. Question: What did the writer think of the son? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Helpful.\\"? A:","output":"The writer thought of their son, Billy, as a caring, helpful, and persevering individual who, despite being told not to waste water, understood the importance of offering assistance to the baby deer. Billy's actions reflect his compassionate nature, as he was willing to endure the journey back and forth between the woods and the house to provide the dehydrated baby deer with water, using his cupped hands as a makeshift container. The writer was initially perplexed by Billy's actions but eventually realized the intentions behind his efforts. Upon understanding the situation, the writer could not help but be moved by their son's dedication and willingness to help the vulnerable animal. At the end of the article, the writer ultimately acknowledges and supports Billy's actions by joining him with a small pot of water. Given that \\"helpful\\" can describe the son's actions, the answer would be \\"Yes\\". The writer considered their son to be helpful as they realized the importance of his actions and the impact it had on saving the baby deer's life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
