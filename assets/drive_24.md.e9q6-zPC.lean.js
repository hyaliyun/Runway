This is illustrated in Figure below .   Q: What characteristic of particles determines how they are carried by flowing water?   A: Options: A). density. B). color. C). texture. D). size. Answer:","output":"D). size The characteristic of particles that determines how they are carried by flowing water is their size. The paragraph specifically states that \\"The size of particles determines how they are carried by flowing water.\\" In this context, it is clear that the size of particles plays a crucial role in their ability to be transported and dispersed by the flowing water. The transportation and deposition of particles by flowing water is a vital process in the natural world and is an essential component of the water cycle. Different sizes of particles can be carried by water in various ways, depending on factors such as the velocity of the water and the properties of the particles themselves. As the size of a particle increases, the gravitational force acting on it becomes stronger, and it is more likely to settle at the bottom of the stream or river bed. Conversely, smaller particles, like silt and clay, are more likely to be suspended in the water and carried by the flow. It is important to note that while density, color, and texture might affect certain properties of particles, like how they interact with their environment and each other, they do not have the same direct influence on their transportability by flowing water as their size does. Dense materials, for example, may be more difficult to erode and transport, but this is still largely determined by the size of the individual particles. Similarly, the texture of a particle may influence its ability to adhere to other materials, but, again, this will be secondary to the size of the particle in determining how it is carried by flowing water. In summary, the key characteristic of particles that determines how they are carried by flowing water is their size, as outlined in the provided paragraph. It is the primary factor that influences how particles are transported, suspended, or deposited in water bodies. While other properties like density, color, and texture may also play a role in the overall behavior of particles in a water environment, their contribution to the transportability of the particles is comparatively smaller than the size of the particles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Article:","output":"Title: Controversial Neuroscience Research in Nairobi: A Glimpse of Hope for Stroke Patients or Ethical Dilemma? Introduction: The quest for modern medicine to unravel the mysteries of neurological disorders has led to numerous discoveries and breakthroughs in recent years. Despite these advancements, certain research methods continue to ignite ethical debates related to animal testing. This article will delve into the recent controversy surrounding British neuroscientist Stuart Baker, who has been accused of bypassing British law by conducting research on baboons in Nairobi. The research itself could have significant implications on potential treatments for stroke patients and could also provide insights into motor neurone disease and Alzheimer's. Bypassing British Law: Dr. Stuart Baker's Travel to Nairobi: Dr. Stuart Baker, a renowned neuroscientist, has sparked an ethical debate as he was accused of bypassing British law to perform his research. Dr. Baker has taken his work to Nairobi, where he conducts research on baboons captured on the plains of Africa. The choice of conducting research on wild animals, specifically baboons, in a foreign country has alarmed animal rights activists and concerned citizens, questioning the legality of his actions. The Potential Impact of Dr. Baker's Research: Despite the controversy surrounding his work, Dr. Baker's research has the potential to pave the way for vital new treatments for stroke patients. Strokes, caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain or a burst blood vessel, often result in severe disability or death. Dr. Baker's work aims to provide breakthrough solutions to rehabilitating patients suffering from the after-effects of a stroke. Moreover, his research may offer valuable insights into other neurological disorders, including motor neurone disease and Alzheimer's. Motor neurone disease comprises a group of conditions that cause the nerves in the spine and brain to progressively lose function. Alzheimer's, on the other hand, is a progressive disease that affects memory, thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. Both of these debilitating conditions have yet to find a cure, and Dr. Baker's work may provide the much-needed understanding to expedite their treatments. The Ethical Dilemma: Animal Rights and Neuroscience Research: Animal testing has been a longstanding ethical issue when it comes to neuroscience research. As society progresses toward a more humane approach to scientific research, the use of animals in such studies becomes increasingly controversial. Dr. Stuart Baker is not exempt from these discussions as his work with wild baboons has raised concerns regarding the ethical treatment of animals. Animal rights activists argue that it is unjust to subject animals to various procedures, regardless of the potential benefits for humans. Additionally, concerns surrounding the legality of his actions in Nairobi and the possibility of bypassing British law fuel the debate of whether the ends justify the means. Conclusion: The controversy surrounding Dr. Stuart Baker's neuronal research in Nairobi highlights the ongoing struggle between scientific advancement and ethical considerations. While his research could potentially lead to groundbreaking discoveries and treatment options for stroke patients and other neurological disorders, the means by which these results are obtained continue to ignite ethical debates. As we continue to push the boundaries of modern medicine, striking a balance between ethical research and medical advancement becomes increasingly challenging. It is crucial to ensure that scientific research is conducted under a scrutiny of moral and legal guidelines while continuing to explore and develop new solutions to humanity's most pressing medical challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more magma rising from deep within the Earth will have a direct effect on the process.  If more magma rises from deep within the Earth, several changes may occur in the process you described:  1. Increased magma volume: The increased amount of magma will cause a higher volume of magma to be present in the volcanoes. This will result in more pressure building up within the volcano as the magma accumulates. 2. Faster rate of eruptions: The increased magma supply and pressure may lead to more frequent volcanic eruptions, as the pressure build-up will likely cause the magma to push through the surface of the volcano at a quicker pace.  3. Larger volume of lava produced: During volcanic eruptions, the increased amount of magma will result in a greater volume of lava being released. This will lead to more lava cooling and forming new rock on the Earth's surface.  4. Larger rocks formed and faster land formation: With more lava cooling and solidifying, there will be a larger amount of new rock formations. This may lead to faster land formation or expansion in areas where volcanic activity is prevalent. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of more magma rising from deep within the Earth will have a direct effect on the process.

The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Nikki Clan was a Mexican Pop rock band from Nogales, Sonora and Mexicali, Baja California, The band is formed by Yadira Gianola (lead vocals), Alberto Espinosa (bass guitar), José Antonio Dabdoub (guitar), Ángel Yáñez (guitar), and José Carlos Fausto Monroy (drums).

His eyes were open and his head bobbed around at an impossible angle. He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it.

He was speaking as the northern city of Aleppo endured a day of relentless air strikes, with the Syrian military determined to retake rebel-held areas. A seven-day US-Russian brokered truce collapsed on Monday. Mr Lavrov laid the blame on the US for failing to control the rebel groups it backs. He said a key condition of the truce was for moderate rebel groups backed by the US to separate themselves from militants. \\"Unfortunately the coalition led by the United States, which committed itself to make sure that this separation happens, has not been able to do this,\\" Mr Lavrov said, although he said his \\"good friend\\" Secretary of State John Kerry had indicated this remained the commitment of the United States. Mr Lavrov said that if the location of militants of the Nusra Front could be pinpointed, he remained convinced a cessation of hostilities and a delivery of humanitarian aid would be possible. He said it was \\"now essential to prevent a disruption\\" of the US-Russia agreements. Mr Lavrov also spoke of a \\"bleeding Middle East and North Africa\\", the result of \\"arrogant attitudes and feelings of infallibility in pushing unilateral and reckless solutions\\". Mr Kerry said he had met Mr Lavrov earlier in the day and that there was \\"a little bit of progress\\" on resolving differences on Syria. \\"We're evaluating some mutual ideas in a constructive way, period,\\" Mr Kerry said. But the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins in New York says there appears to be little hope of any diplomatic progress and that, with the violence in Syria this week, jaw-jaw has absolutely lost out to war-war. The head of a hospital in the rebel-held east told Reuters news agency that 91 people had been killed in Friday's bombardment. In between the raids, White Helmet volunteers frantically searched for those trapped in the rubble of demolished buildings, often with bare hands. One video showed a screaming girl being pulled out alive, another was of a toddler with no signs of life. \\"In many areas, the wounded and sick have nowhere to go at all - they are simply left to die,\\" said Carlos Francisco, Medecins Sans Frontieres head of mission in Syria. One White Helmet volunteer reported air strikes as he gave an interview to the BBC World Service. Another rescue worker described what was happening as \\"annihilation\\". Unicef said that nearly two million people were again without running water after an attack on a pumping station that served the rebel-held east of the city, and the retaliatory shutdown of a station serving the government-controlled west. The White Helmets said centres set up to help victims of bombardments were being targeted, and three out of four had been put out of action. Islamic State and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Ammar al-Selmo, the head of civil defence in eastern Aleppo, told Reuters that at least 40 buildings had been destroyed. Activists said both Syrian and Russian warplanes were taking part in the offensive, though Russia has not confirmed its involvement. Announcing the new offensive on state television late on Thursday, the Syrian government warned Aleppo residents to \\"stay away\\" from \\"terrorist positions\\".

Question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.

The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13.

Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I really have no major complaints about my Garmin eTrex (lovingly called \\"the yellow eTrex\\"). The interface is simple, and the unit is small and light.Some may wish they had gone a step up to a model with the thumb-stick for easier interface navigation. I was one such person, and I have to admit that the thumb stick is much easier to use than the up/down buttons that you're limited to with the yellow eTrex.Buyer beware when it comes to USED yellow eTrex models. Many versions of it were sold that were not WAAS enabled. You can ask a seller if the system menu has an option to disable/enable WAAS. If not, you're looking at a slightly less accurate model (but if the price is right for you, it shouldn't matter too much). Answer:","output":"Based on the given review, it seems that the user would most likely recommend the Garmin eTrex, also known as \\"the yellow eTrex\\". There are a few factors that hint at a positive recommendation, despite a couple of minor concerns. The user mentions that they have no major complaints about the product and appreciates the simplicity of its interface as well as its small size and light weight. These qualities indicate a general satisfaction with the product. Moreover, while the absence of a thumb-stick is raised as a concern, the reviewer acknowledges that the up/down buttons remain functional, just less convenient than the thumb-stick. The buyer beware note in the review appears to be more of a helpful tip for potential buyers than a negative criticism of the product itself. The user advises checking if the item is WAAS enabled in case of used models and suggests that even if a model is less accurate due to lack of WAAS, the price may still make it worth considering. This information seems to demonstrate an overall positive view of the product, as the reviewer provides additional guidance that could enhance the buying experience for others. In conclusion, while the review does mention a few drawbacks, the overall tone and content suggest that the user is largely satisfied with the Garmin eTrex and would likely recommend it to others, especially if they have considered these minor concerns and determined that they are acceptable trade-offs for the attractive features described."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which continent was inhabited by fewer turtles?  Two continents were known for the strange discrepancies in animal populations. Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles.  Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... A:","output":"The continent that was inhabited by fewer turtles is Africa. The paragraph mentions that Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Since turtles are a type of reptile, it can be inferred that there were fewer turtles in Africa as compared to Asia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that painted Albrecht the Elder's panel?, what is it ?

Here is a goal: How do you open your hood? How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"The process to open the hood of a car doesn't vary much from vehicle to vehicle. Here's a general step-by-step process you can follow: 1. **Locate Hood Release Handle**: The first step is to locate the hood release handle of your car. Usually, it's found in the driver's side footwell, under the dashboard. It might also be situated on the lower left-hand side of the dashboard where the door meets it when closed. In some cars, it might be by the driver's door. Most likely, it will have an icon of a car with an ‘upward-looking’ arrow or the term \\"Hood\\" written on it.  2. **Pull Hood Release Handle**: Once you've located the hood release, you'll need to pull it. Normally it will require a firm pull to activate the release mechanism. This will partially open the hood, allowing you to open it fully from outside of the vehicle. 3. **Locate Hood Catch**: After you have pulled the hood release handle from inside, step out of the vehicle and proceed to the front of it. Depending on how your hood release is designed, you may see a small portion of your hood that has risen.  4. **Release the Hood Catch or Hood latch**: Some cars have a secondary latch that you'll need to locate, this separate handle or latch usually takes the form of a lever or push-button that you need to slide or push. Slide your fingers underneath the partially opened hood and feel around for the latch. It is typically positioned in the center beneath the hood and above the logo on the grille.  5. **Open the Hood**: Once you've disengaged the latch, you can now lift the hood. Do this by holding onto the sides of the hood and raising it all the way up. 6. **Secure the Hood with the Prop rod**: Some hoods will have hydraulic or spring-loaded struts that hold the hood open once you lift it. If your car doesn't, it likely has a prop rod — a thin rod attached to the underside of the hood or the car’s chassis. Lift this rod and fit it into the hole on the underside of the hood designed to hold the rod. This keeps the hood securely open while you’re working in the engine compartment. Remember to be gentle while handling the hood to avoid any damage. Do not force it if it doesn't open; there might be some mechanical issues which you need professional help to handle. Also, make sure the car is turned off before popping the hood to prevent any accidents.  This process can slightly differ depending on your car model, so it's a good idea to check the vehicle's manual for the exact process."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

This method is largely autonomous and isn't directly influenced by weather changes such as rain. However, it's important to point out that while the rain itself does not directly increase or decrease the amount of oxygen that reaches the body, it can affect factors that do have an impact on respiration. For example, rain often leads to cleaner air due to the effect of rain \\"washing\\" away pollutants in the air. This can potentially make breathing easier, especially for individuals with respiratory issues. But this doesn't affect the overall percentage of oxygen in the air or the ability of a healthy person's body to intake or utilize oxygen.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States.

AFSOC provides Air Force Special Operations Forces ( SOF ) for worldwide deployment and assignment to regional unified combatant commands . AFSOC was initially established on 10 February 1983 as Twenty - Third Air Force ( 23 AF ) , a subordinate numbered air force of the Military Airlift Command ( MAC ) , with 23 AF headquarters established at Hurlburt Field , Florida . On 22 May 1990 , 23 AF was redesignated as AFSOC and became a separate major command ( MAJCOM ) responsible for all USAF special operations forces ( SOF ) , aircraft and personnel in the Regular Air Force , Air Force Reserve , and the Air National Guard ( ANG ) .  - Special forces and special operations forces are military or police units trained to conduct special operations. NATO defines special operations as \\"military activities conducted by specially designated, organized, trained, and equipped forces, manned with selected personnel, using unconventional tactics, techniques, and modes of employment\\".  - Air Combat Command (ACC) is one of ten Major Commands (MAJCOMs) in the United States Air Force, reporting to Headquarters, United States Air Force (HAF) at the Pentagon.  - Special operations (S.O.) are military operations that are \\"special\\" or unconventional and carried out by dedicated special forces and other special operations forces units using unconventional methods and resources. Special operations may be performed independently of or in conjunction with, conventional military operations. The primary goal is to achieve a political or military objective where a conventional force requirement does not exist or might adversely affect the overall strategic outcome. Special operations are usually conducted in a low-profile manner that aims to achieve the advantages of speed, surprise, and violence of action against an unsuspecting target. Special ops are typically carried out with limited numbers of highly trained personnel that are adaptable, self-reliant and able to operate in all environments, and able to use unconventional combat skills and equipment. Special operations are usually implemented through specific, tailored intelligence.  - Aerial warfare is the use of military aircraft and other flying machines in warfare. Aerial warfare includes bombers attacking enemy concentrations or strategic targets; fighter aircraft battling for control of airspace; attack aircraft engaging in close air support against ground targets; naval aviation flying against sea and nearby land targets; gliders, helicopters and other aircraft to carry airborne forces such as paratroopers; aerial refueling tankers to extend operation time or range; and military transport aircraft to move cargo and personnel. Historically, military aircraft have included lighter-than-air balloons carrying artillery observers; lighter-than-air airships for bombing cities; various sorts of reconnaissance, surveillance and early warning aircraft carrying observers, cameras and radar equipment; torpedo bombers to attack enemy shipping; and military air-sea rescue aircraft for saving downed airmen. Modern aerial warfare includes missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Surface forces are likely to respond to enemy air activity with anti-aircraft warfare.  - Hurlburt Field is a United States Air Force installation located in Okaloosa County, Florida, immediately west of the Town of Mary Esther.

Article: Renault's new Twizy could be the future of motoring ... or at least a big part of it. This is not some crazy future concept -- this is a real vehicle, fully electric, and on sale now. Prices for the Twizy start at PS6,690, with battery hire from PS45 a month. But is it a car? Technically no, it' s classified under UK law as something closer to a moped  . A two-seater (the passenger sits behind the driver), the Twizy runs on electric power only, and is designed to cover all those little trips we do. And as 87 percent of Europe's drivers do less than 37 miles a day -- 50 per cent less than 12--there's really no need to be burning gas for that sort of journey. The Twizy is arguably the most unusual vehicle in this country. Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way. The Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours. There are no full doors on the vehicle, so think of it like a covered moped with four wheels, but no noise and no need for a helmet. There's also a lower-powered type being designed, the Twizy 45, for which you don' t need a license. Seeing the Twizy in the flesh, you' re surprised by how striking it looks. Sit in it and everything feels right --just car enough to be easy, but different enough to be exciting. With the battery underneath you, the vehicle is suckered   to the road, and the electric power means it accelerates with real energy up to about 50 mph. You don't feel you need any more. In the UK, the weather alone may make it a good buy, but the lack of easy access to outdoor sockets is the biggest challenge. Only time will tell if this brave move answers enough problems to find a place in our lives.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who replaced Zack de la Rocha? , can you please find it?   Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues. A:","output":"The person who replaced Zack de la Rocha as the lead vocalist of the band formed by the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine was Chris Cornell, the former frontman of Soundgarden. This recommendation came from their music producer and friend Rick Rubin. Chris Cornell's chemistry with the other three members of the band was described as immediate and \\"transcendent\\".

Question: Ptolemy was an ancient astronomer who thought Earth was the center of the universe. When he made observations that were inconsistent with this, he proposed a phenomenon called \\"epicycles\\" to explain the observations. How was Ptolemy's process similar to the modern scientific process? OPT: (1). Ptolemy based his model partly on a belief system. (2). Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations. (3). Ptolemy tried to describe the universe instead of explaining it. (4). Experiments were the basis of Ptolemy's model of the universe. Answer:","output":"(2). Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations. Step 1: Understanding the context of the question To address this question, it is essential to recognize that it asks for a comparison between Ptolemy's process and the modern scientific process. Step 2: Comparing the options with the modern scientific process Now, let's evaluate each option against the modern scientific process, which generally involves observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, and refining explanations based on new evidence. Option 1: Ptolemy based his model partly on a belief system. While it is true that Ptolemy's geocentric model was based on the belief that Earth was at the center of the universe, modern science relies on evidence-based findings rather than belief systems. Therefore, this option does not align with the modern scientific process. Option 2: Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations. This option demonstrates adherence to the modern scientific process. Ptolemy made observations, which led him to modify his theory by introducing epicycles. This is in line with the modern scientific method, where observation leads to the testing and refining of theories. Option 3: Ptolemy tried to describe the universe instead of explaining it. This statement does not align with the modern scientific process. Ptolemy did try to explain the universe by presenting a model that accounted for his observations. The modern scientific method also seeks to understand and explain the world around us. Option 4: Experiments were the basis of Ptolemy's model of the universe. Ptolemy's model was based on observations rather than experiments since technology and methods at the time were limited. In contrast, experiments form a core component of the modern scientific process. Step 3: Choosing the best answer Based on the comparison, option (2) Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations is the most closely related to the modern scientific process. Ptolemy observed inconsistencies, formed a hypothesis with the introduction of epicycles, and refined his model accordingly - all of which aligns with modern scientific methodology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Simple single-celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA, whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms, including humans, contain an absolute majority of DNA without an identified function. This DNA has often been referred to as \\"junk DNA\\". However, more recent analyses suggest that, although protein-coding DNA makes up barely 2% of the human genome, about 80% of the bases in the genome may be expressed, so the term \\"junk DNA\\" may be a misnomer.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Based on the given context, the genes of prokaryotes are denser than those of humans. This is because prokaryotic chromosomes are relatively gene-dense, while eukaryotic genomes, such as the human genome, often contain regions of DNA that serve no obvious function and are less dense. Although the term \\"junk DNA\\" might be a misnomer as 80% of the bases in the human genome may be expressed, the fact remains that only 2% of it consists of protein-coding DNA.

Hill farm practiced conventional agriculture, while Dew farm practiced permaculture design within the context of organic farming.  But I can use this background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  What is an answer for this question: Which farm generated more marine litter?","output":"Based on the given situation and background information, it appears that Hill farm, which practiced conventional agriculture, would likely generate more marine litter.  Conventional agriculture often involves the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. These chemicals can cause nutrient pollution in the nearby river when they are washed off the fields during rain or irrigation. The polluted river water then flows into the ocean, contributing to marine pollution, hypoxia, and the creation of dead zones. On the other hand, Dew farm practices permaculture design within the context of organic farming. Permaculture is a sustainable agricultural approach focused on creating a harmonious integration of the landscape, plants, animals, and people. It generally avoids the use of synthetic chemicals and instead relies on natural methods for soil fertility and pest control. Organic farming also utilizes environmentally friendly practices, such as cover cropping, crop rotation, and the use of organic fertilizers like compost and manure. These practices help in reducing the risk of nutrient pollution in water bodies, thus minimizing the potential for marine litter generation. In conclusion, it is more likely that Hill farm, with its conventional agriculture practices, generated more marine litter compared to Dew farm, which practiced sustainable permaculture and organic farming methods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first record released with 'Love This Records' was a dance cover of the track Total Eclipse of the Heart. It was a worldwide hit for Nicki French, reaching No. 2 in America and No. 1 in seven countries selling over 2 million copies. In 1994 Simon Cowell asked Stock to produce the record for the popular kid's TV show 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers' which was a top 5 hit in the UK. Cowell had worked with Stock on previous occasions with artists such as Sinitta, for whom Stock wrote and produced various hits like Toy Boy in 1987. Stock again collaborated with Cowell in 1993 on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) album Wrestlemania which spawned the No. 4 hit 'Slam Jam'.  In 1994 Stock produced several artists for Simon Cowell including Kym Mazelle, Jocelyn Brown and Robson and Jerome. Their cover of Unchained Melody produced by Stock and Aitken became the highest selling non-charity single of the decade, remaining at No. 1 for 7 weeks in 1995 selling 2.5 million copies. Stock produced a further two No. 1 singles with Robson and Jerome and two No. 1 albums.  After several years producing hits for Stock's own label 'Love This Records' and with Simon Cowell for BMG/RCA, the structural integrity of Stock's studio became compromised by the tunnelling of the Jubilee Line extension, and the damage forced Stock to pursue legal action against London Underground. As a result, Stock was forced to pull out of a joint deal with Cowell and BMG to produce several artists including the band Westlife in 1996.  In 1998 Stock and Aitken teamed up with Steve Crosby who had created the group Steps, to form the band Scooch. Their first single 'When My Baby' reached No. 29 and their follow up, 'More Than I Needed To Know', was a top 5 hit in the UK in 2000 and went to No. 1 in Japan. Scooch's album 'Four Sure' spawned two more top 20 singles. Stock also scored a top 20 with 'Airhead' by girl band Girls@Play, with EastEnders' star Rita Simons that toured with Steps. In 2003 Stock formed the label Better the Devil Records and had a huge hit with the Fast Food Song selling 200,000 CD singles.

Like all English boys who prepared for college in grammar schools, he had learned not only to read Latin but also to speak and write it smoothly and correctly. His pronunciation of Latin was English, however, and seemed to have sounded strange to his friends when he later visitedItaly.   Schoolboys gained their skill in Latin in a bitter way. They kept in mind the rules to make learning by heart easier. They first made a word-for-word translation and then an idiomatic translation into English. As they increased their skill, they translated their English back into Latin without referring to the book and then compared their translation with the original. The schoolmaster was always at hand to encourage them. All schoolmasters believed  _ .   After several years of study, the boys began to write compositions in imitation  of the Latin writers they read. And as they began to read Latin poems, they began to write poems in Latin.

The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city has less air pollution?  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Adverbs often modify verbs and other parts of speech and they usually give us more information about how an action is performed. Step 3: Classify the emotion This is a key step where we classify the emotion based on the identified adverb. The word 'terrified' is an adverb that depicts a state of fear. While there may be other words in the sentence that could imply different emotions, the task is to focus on the emotion implied by the adverb.  Therefore, After identifying and analyzing the adverb, the sentence 'I made Ryan feel terrified.' should be classified under the emotion 'fear'.

Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near St. Joseph, Missouri; d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice Ives Welles (b. Beatrice Lucy Ives, September 1, 1883, Springfield, Illinois; d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). Breaking with the Federal Theatre Project in 1937, Welles and Houseman founded their own repertory company, which they called the Mercury Theatre. The name was inspired by the title of the iconoclastic magazine, The American Mercury. Welles was executive producer, and the original company included such actors as Joseph Cotten, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Arlene Francis, Martin Gabel, John Hoyt, Norman Lloyd, Vincent Price, Stefan Schnabel and Hiram Sherman.  \\"I think he was the greatest directorial talent we've ever had in the [American] theater,\\" Lloyd said of Welles in a 2014 interview. \\"When you saw a Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. We had not had such a man in our theater. He was the first and remains the greatest.\\"  The Mercury Theatre opened November 11, 1937, with Caesar, Welles's modern-dress adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy Julius Caesar -- streamlined into an anti-fascist tour de force that Joseph Cotten later described as \\"so vigorous, so contemporary that it set Broadway on its ear.\\" The set was completely open with no curtain, and the brick stage wall was painted dark red. Scene changes were achieved by lighting alone. On the stage was a series of risers; squares were cut into one at intervals and lights were set beneath it, pointing straight up to evoke the \\"cathedral of light\\" at the Nuremberg Rallies. \\"He staged it like a political melodrama that happened the night before,\\" said Lloyd.  Beginning January 1, 1938, Caesar was performed in repertory with The Shoemaker's Holiday; both productions moved to the larger National Theatre. They were followed by Heartbreak House (April 29, 1938) and Danton's Death (November 5, 1938). As well as being presented in a pared-down oratorio version at the Mercury Theatre on Sunday nights in December 1937, The Cradle Will Rock was at the Windsor Theatre for 13 weeks (January 4-April 2, 1938). Such was the success of the Mercury Theatre that Welles appeared on the cover of Time magazine, in full makeup as Captain Shotover in Heartbreak House, in the issue dated May 9, 1938--three days after his 23rd birthday.","output":"This text is about George Orson Welles, a very talented man who was an actor, writer, director, and producer.

At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  Now, I have a new situation: Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect.  Answer this question please: Which friend studied less about short wavelength solar energy? A:","output":"The friend who studied less about short wavelength solar energy would be Vick.  In the information you provided, Vick is noted to have studied more about the troposphere, which is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere. The troposphere is where weather occurs and contains about 75% of the atmosphere's mass and 99% of its water vapor and aerosols. Studying the troposphere indeed requires understanding about temperature, pressure, wind, weather patterns, and other atmospheric conditions. However, while it would involve some understanding of how solar energy influences these conditions, it might not delve deeply into the specifics of solar energy wavelengths per se. On the other hand, Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect which directly involves the concept of short wavelength solar energy. Understanding the Greenhouse Effect requires knowledge about how the Sun's shortwave radiation—or short wavelength solar energy— penetrates Earth's atmosphere and is absorbed by the Earth's surface. This process is crucial to understanding how the Earth's temperature is regulated and what happens when additional greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, trapping more of this heat and contributing to global warming. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vick, who focused his studies on the troposphere, is likely to have studied less about short wavelength solar energy compared to Frank, who studied the Greenhouse Effect."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course.  They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   If Thomas wanted the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, should he increase or decrease the temperature of his reactions?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.","output":"Based on the hint provided, it is clear that higher temperatures lead to faster reaction rates due to particles having more energy and colliding more frequently and with greater force. Since Justin is conducting his reactions at a high temperature and Thomas wants the rate of his reactions to be similar to Justin's, Thomas should increase the temperature of his reactions. By doing so, he will increase the energy of the reactants, resulting in a faster reaction rate that is more comparable to Justin's."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye","output":"The sentiment of the given sentence can be considered as mostly positive with a touch of neutrality. Let me break down the reasoning for this classification. The sentence is discussing the depiction of schizophrenia in a film, which is a sensitive and complex topic. The expression \\"stylish film\\" suggests that the film possesses visual or stylistic appeal, which is a positive aspect. Additionally, the phrase \\"able to visualize schizophrenia\\" acknowledges the film's effectiveness in portraying this illness. Such a portrayal can be considered successful and praiseworthy since it's not easy to depict mental health issues accurately in film format. Furthermore, the mention of the film being \\"confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye\\" indicates that the film approaches the subject matter with sensitivity and respect. The use of the term \\"confident\\" connotes a sense of self-assurance, which can be perceived as a positive attribute. The sentence implies that the film does not exploit the character's mental health condition for sensationalism, but rather, it responsibly examines the character's situation. Such a measured and thoughtful approach demonstrates the film's maturity and depth, which can also be perceived as commendable. Although the subject matter of the sentence, i.e., schizophrenia, might be considered negative due to the challenges it presents to those who have this condition and their loved ones, the overall sentiment of the sentence leans towards positive, as it appreciates the film's effectiveness and the techniques employed in portraying this sensitive issue. To conclude, the sentiment of the sentence should be classified as predominantly positive with a touch of neutrality, given the appreciation for the film's style, portrayal, and handling of a sensitive and complex subject like schizophrenia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They divided the universe into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors on the planet, feeding off of their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor. Hal Jordan, a cocky test pilot working at Ferris Aircraft, is chosen by the ring and transported to the crash site, where the dying Abin Sur appoints him a Green Lantern, telling him to take the lantern and speak the oath. At home he says the oath and is later whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with veteran Corps members Tomar-Re and Kilowog and Corps leader Sinestro, who believes he is unfit and fearful. Jordan quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern. Meanwhile, scientist Hector Hammond is summoned by his strikingly attractive, muscular[3] father, Senator Robert Hammond, to a secret government facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body, under the watchful eye of Amanda Waller. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers, at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his father's influence, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a party.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. To many of Dylan's followers in the folk music scene, the Beatles were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\\" Within six months of the meeting, according to Gould, \\"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\\"; and six months after that, Dylan began performing with a backing band and electric instrumentation, and \\"dressed in the height of Mod fashion\\". As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

Inside a viewing party for Fox's Batman prequel NEW YORK CITY — The crisp, clear, comfortable night stands in stark contrast to most days in Gotham, the fictional home of both Bruce Wayne (a.k.a. Batman) and Fox's eponymous TV series, populated by supervillains and heroes in the making. Warner Brothers Studios invited cast and press to a Monday viewing party for the somewhat struggling show's midseason return. Since its launch in fall 2014, Gotham's ratings have tumbled 50%. It now averages just over 4 million viewers a night, despite enjoying a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It’s a moody and often brutal show — bonus points if you ever spot sunlight — that centers not so much on the Caped Crusader, played here by 15-year-old David Mazouz, but on the origins of the endless supply of villains he'll face one day. On this night, the show will introduce Victor Fries, a tragic figure who desperately wants to save his wife’s life by freezing her until he can find a cure for the disease that's killing her. GOTHAM: Guest star Nathan Darrow plays Victor Fries, A.K.A. Mr. Freeze. Image: Â©2016 Fox Broadcasting Co. Cr: Jessica Miglio FOX The cast, crew and more than half a dozen roving journalists are squeezed into a long, covered terrace on a Manhattan hotel rooftop. If you look up through the roof's plastic coveing, you can make out the Empire State Building looming above. Chris Chalk, who plays a much younger Lucius Fox (and Bruce Wayne protector) than Morgan Freeman did in Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, is seated on a porch swing with Jessica Lucas, who plays Tabitha Galavan. They’ve yet to have any scenes together. Nearby, Drew Powell, who plays the hulking menace Butch, is ebullient, hugging cast members and generally playing against type. He tells me that Butch will be coming into his own this season. When I ask him and other cast members if they’re in tonight’s episode, none can quite remember. The cast has already shot the majority of the season; they'll return to work shortly to finish out the last two episodes of the year. We’ve assembled almost two hours before the show airs on the east coast, and Gotham-themed drinks are flowing. Perhaps that’s why nobody panics when no one can figure out how to work the large-screen TV at the front of the room. Gotham cast members, from left to right, Jessica Lucas, Chris Chalk and Sean Pertwee, tweeting during the mid-season premiere. A visibly pregnant Morena Baccarin stands near the TV, which is adjacent to one of the comfy couches she returns to every few minutes or so. Baccarin plays Dr. Leslie Thompkins, girlfriend of Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie). At the moment, though, she’s enjoying accolades for her role in the hit film Deadpool. We talk a bit about working with Ryan Reynolds and her stunt work. Baccarin especially enjoyed playing a female character who wasn’t just a damsel in distress. She’s extremely gracious, but when I finally ask if she wants to sit down. Baccarin looks relieved. Later, she tells me that if she goes into labor, we'll be in luck — her hospital is nearby. Donal Logue, who plays Gordon’s partner Det. Harvey Bullock, is squeezed into a corner, texting, when I walk up and wish him a happy birthday. The veteran character actor just turned 50. A few feet away stand Ben McKenzie’s publicists, apparently filtering access to the intense actor. Drew Powell (with thumb raised) sits next to Anthony Carrigan (left) who plays villain Victor Zsas. Robin Lorde Taylor is seated on the other side of the room, pale and still sporting Penguin's jet-black hair. As we talk, I realize that, in person, he isn't very menacing. Maybe that's because he's missing Penguin's nose, which the show elongates slightly with a prosthesis for the role. I ask what to expect from his character this season. His answer: “Imagine everything you are being stripped away. What would be left?” Robin Lord Taylor as The Penguin. Image: Â©2016 Fox Broadcasting Co. Cr: Jessica Miglio, FOX The show frequently takes those kinds of turns, defying expectations with a level of violence and gore rarely seen at 8 p.m. on a network. Tonight’s episode features both an inmate who appears to have gouged out his own eyes and a man who disintegrates into a pile of goo. I tell Erin Richards, who plays Barbara Kean, how shocked I was when her character stabbed and murdered both her parents in Season 1. She, like others agrees that Gotham is not your parents’ Batman. When I mention the show's bait-and-switch habit — when, for example, it killed off the kid apparently playing a young Joker — Richards grins slyly. “No one ever dies in Gotham,\\" she says. An enterprising assistant figures out how to connect her laptop to the TV; finally, we’re watching the episode. Penguin is in jail, while Jim Gordon and Logue’s Det. Bullock are investigating a weird bunch of frozen victims. GOTHAM: Guest star BD Wong in the Rise of the Villains Image: Fox Broadcasting Co. Cr: Jessica Miglio, FOX I’m seated behind B.D. Wong, who just joined the show as Dr. Hugo Strange. He's in the midseason premiere, but many cast members here tonight don't not actually appear in the episode — including David Mazouz, seated next to his mother near the back of the room. I’d met Mazouz once before. Tonight, I notice that he’s visibly taller and his voice is breaking. Corey Michael Smith (Edward Nygma) sits next to Camren Bicondova (Selina Kyle). The reserved Smith never left that stool for the duration of the event. We watch as the show continues in its dark, intense way, a gloom pervading the sky and characters. I ask cast members if it’s ever sunny in Gotham. They laugh and tell me no — but remind me that the show was nominated for an Emmy last year for Outstanding Production Design. The episode ends with Victor Fries being dubbed Mr. Freeze and Penguin facing a very uncertain future. There’s a smattering of cheers and applause. Then I make my way back out into the night. Once I'm back at street level, I can't help but look up — scanning the rooftops in vain for the flash of a cape. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.

Wood was born in Oxford Street, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, née Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\".   His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown.  In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who first commissioned the dredging of a canal, and Silver Springs Creek was narrowed between Big Spring and Elixir Spring, which created Big Spring Lake?  Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Why do mostly Indian Muslims are not accepting that their ancestors were Hindu? Why do Indian Muslims and Christians not accept that their ancestors were Hindu? Do those questions have the same meaning? OPTIONS: [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"Before diving into the main questions, it is important to clarify whether the two questions have the same meaning or not. The answer is [i] no. While both questions address the issue of Indian Muslims and Christians not accepting their Hindu ancestry, the first question specifically refers to \\"Indian Muslims,\\" and the second question refers to both \\"Indian Muslims and Christians.\\" Now, let's address each question individually. 1. Why do mostly Indian Muslims not accept that their ancestors were Hindu? The roots of this issue can be traced back to various historical, social, religious, and political factors that have shaped Indian society over the centuries. The following are some possible reasons why Indian Muslims may not accept that their ancestors were Hindu: a. Historical narratives: With the arrival of Islamic invaders and the creation of Muslim empires in India, conversion to Islam became more prevalent over time. These historical narratives often portrayed conversion as a means to escape caste-based discrimination, gain social mobility or to embrace a monotheistic faith. Thus, for some Indian Muslims, accepting their Hindu ancestry might be a challenge due to these historical accounts. b. Identity formation: Over time, religious identity has become deeply ingrained in Indian society. Accepting their Hindu ancestry may lead to a perceived weakening of their religious identity as Muslims, which they might not be willing to consider. c. Social and communal divides: At various points in history, tensions and conflicts between Hindus and Muslims have resulted in deep-rooted social divides. Acknowledging Hindu ancestry can be seen as a threat to the already fragile understanding between the two communities. d. Political factors: India's political history has seen the emergence of parties and organizations with conflicting ideologies. Some Muslim groups may not accept their Hindu ancestry because of their allegiance to certain political ideologies that place emphasis on fostering a strong Muslim identity. 2. Why do Indian Muslims and Christians not accept that their ancestors were Hindu? Similar factors apply to Indian Christians not accepting their Hindu ancestry. We can summarize the reasons as follows: a. Historical narratives: The arrival of European colonial powers and Christian missionaries in India led to the spread of Christianity. Conversion was often seen as a means of adopting modern western values and gaining access to superior education and opportunities. These historical accounts might make it difficult for Indian Christians to accept their Hindu ancestry. b. Identity formation: As mentioned earlier, religious identity plays a significant role in Indian society. For Indian Christians, accepting Hindu ancestry might challenge their religious identity, making it difficult for them to contemplate the connection. c. Social and communal divides: Communal divisions exist not just between Hindus and Muslims but also between Hindus and Christians. By acknowledging their Hindu ancestry, Indian Christians might feel they are compromising their sense of belonging to the Christian community. d. Political factors: As with Indian Muslims, some Indian Christians may hold onto a fixed religious identity due to their alignment with certain political ideologies or parties that promote religious affinity. Both groups may be reluctant to accept their Hindu ancestry for a combination of historical, social, religious, and political reasons. However, it is crucial to emphasize that not all Indian Muslims or Christians adhere to these beliefs or reject their Hindu ancestry. Individuals from both communities have complex and diverse perspectives on their ancestry and religious identity."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: what countries are very near to Haiti?

Complications arise when Susan falls in love with him and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible, even hiding his clothes, to prevent his imminent marriage. David's prized intercostal clavicle is delivered, but Susan's aunt's dog George takes it and buries it somewhere. When Susan's aunt arrives, she discovers David in a negligee. To David's dismay, she turns out to be potential donor Elizabeth Random. A second message from Mark makes clear the leopard is for Elizabeth, as she always wanted one. Baby and George run off. The zoo is called to help capture Baby. Susan and David race to find Baby before the zoo and, mistaking a dangerous leopard (also portrayed by Nissa) from a nearby circus for Baby, let it out of its cage., what would be the answer ?

According to the Payson Police Department, the boys were playing in an apartment at 303 S. Ash Street at around noon when they discovered a gun.      The 3-year-old shot the 18-month-old in the head. The victim was rushed to Payson Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.      The mother and the two children were visiting a 78-year-old friend at his apartment which is in the same complex where they live.      They had only been there 10 or 15 minutes when the boys got into another room where they found the gun.      Police said, the mother was looking for the boys and just as she walked through the door of that room the 3-year-old boy fired the gun.      There were several 911 calls about a child with a head injury.      Police questioned witnesses and neighbors and the child's mother to figure out how the children got access to the gun.      The semi-automatic gun was not locked up, according to Payson Police Chief Don Engler.      \\"We still intend to serve a search warrant at that location and gather further information,\\" said Chief Engler.      Police said there were multiple weapons in that apartment and the gun the boys found was not locked up.

(AP) -- A police chief in central Arizona says a 3-year-old boy shot and killed his 1 1/2 -year-old brother after the boys found a handgun in a neighbor's apartment.            Payson Police Chief Don Engler says his department's investigation of the Tuesday shooting will take about a week. He says results will be forwarded to the Gila County Attorney's Office for a decision on whether to prosecute anybody.            Engler says the probe centers on the securing of the gun, which he says was not in plain sight in the living area of the neighbor's apartment.            The boys and their mother were visiting the neighbor when the boys found the semi-automatic handgun and took it to another room. Engler says neither adult knew the boys had the weapon.

Article:The engineers were repairing a leaking tank on a Trident submarine while a nearby nuclear reactor was operated. Details of the incident, in February 2012, at the Clyde site emerged after Freedom of Information (FOI) requests by an anti-nuclear group. The Ministry of Defence said no-one was harmed and safety had been improved. MoD reports into several incidents at the Faslane base were obtained using FOI legislation by the campaign group Nuclear Information Service. In the most serious, in August 2012, MoD contractors were repairing a leaking tank on a submarine moored at Faslane, unaware that a nearby nuclear reactor was being operated for prolonged periods. They were reassured about safety, even though their team leader had queried the controls in place. The report said: \\"There was a prolonged and repeated failure of the SS [ship's staff] to understand and control the radiological hazard they were creating.\\" The MoD report has been heavily redacted and does not reveal the level of radiation each worker was exposed to. Other reports obtained by the campaign group reveal: Find out more about Faslane The SNP said the reports raised more questions about safety at the Faslane base. Defence spokesman Brendan O'Hara said: ''The MoD - once again - stands accused of a very poor approach to radiation safety at the Faslane base. \\"When it comes to protecting our armed forces personnel, the contractors working at the base, as well as the wider community, nuclear safety must be paramount. ''These incidents and how they were subsequently handled, pose real and serious questions, not just about nuclear safety procedures at the base - but also whether the regulator, the ONR, is doing enough - and quickly enough - to address these concerns. ''The MoD must investigate and explain why these failings occur and lay out precisely what it is doing to get it sorted.'' The MoD said safety at the base was paramount and none of the events described in the reports caused harm to the health of any member of staff or to any member of the public. A spokesman said: \\"Investigations were carried out and measures put in place to prevent such incidents from occurring again, and we continue to conduct rigorous monitoring as part of our commitment to maintain the highest standards.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"In 2012, some engineers were fixing a leaky tank in a special submarine called a Trident submarine. This happened at a place called the Clyde site. The people who fixed the submarine didn't know that there was a nearby machine called a nuclear reactor that was working at the same time. This was not a safe situation for them. The people in charge didn't understand the dangers very well. The group that found out about this got the information through something called a Freedom of Information request. The Ministry of Defence, or the people in charge of keeping everything safe, said no one was hurt and they have made things safer now.

Summarize this article in one sentence. People with a cold or the flu can have similar symptoms, such as a runny nose, a sore throat, or a cough. However, you're more likely to be achy and run a fever with the flu, and you're also more likely to have chest discomfort and a headache. Sometimes you may also feel nausea or disorientation. If you've only had your symptoms for a day or two, then Tamiflu, an antiviral drug, can help you get better faster, as well as prevent you from getting the flu if people around you are sick.  Since the flu is a virus, it isn't strictly necessary for you to go to the doctor immediately, as the virus will usually run its course without extra help. Nonetheless, if you want to get over the virus more quickly, Tamiflu can reduce the time you're sick as well the severity of the sickness. If someone in your house has the flu but you don’t, you may still get prescribed Tamiflu to avoid getting the virus. Go to the doctor if you have shortness of breath or chest pains or if you can't keep fluids down due to vomiting. Your doctor can help you decide on the best over-the-counter drug options to treat the symptoms. You can also ask your pharmacist for help. If you have complications such as a continuous high fever over 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or chest pains, talk to your doctor.  The flu should only last about 5 to 7 days, so check with your doctor if your symptoms linger.  Complications from the flu can include strep throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, and other infections.

The reviewer has pointed out that the protagonists in the movie took a full hour to determine the most basic and widely known fact when it comes to killing zombies – shooting them in the head. This observation shows signs of dissatisfaction and disappointment, as the critic perceives the film as lacking a sense of urgency, intelligence, or innovation. Moreover, the critic has chosen to emphasize a relatively trivial detail instead of focusing on other aspects of the film such as plot, character development, visuals, or overall atmosphere. This choice indicates that the critic did not find enough positive attributes or engaging elements in the movie to discuss them in their review, leading to the assumption that they had an unfavorable experience while watching it. In conclusion, the short movie review portrays a negative impression of the film, as the critic points out the unimpressive and mundane aspects of the protagonists' decision-making and does not mention any positive features.

Combine like terms: The like terms are -65*q and -78*q: -2145 = (-65 - 78)*q + 2147 - 4292 Step 2. Calculate the sum inside the parentheses (combining the coefficients of q): -2145 = -143*q + 2147 - 4292 Step 3. Combine the constants:  Calculate the sum: 2147 - 4292 = -2145 -2145 = -143*q - 2145 Step 4. Isolate the variable q: Add 2145 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant on the left side: -2145 + 2145 = -143*q - 2145 + 2145 0 = -143*q Step 5.

Why is the narrator unhappy with the management of the place ?","output":"The narrator is unhappy with the management of the place because of the following reasons: 1. Indifference towards the animals: The management seems to be indifferent towards the animals and treats them as if they are a waste of space. This is evident when they clean out the kennel without any compassion or empathy towards the animals living there. 2. Euthanizing animals: The fact that an animal was put down, specifically one that looked similar to the narrator's cat, makes the narrator feel a sense of unease and dissatisfaction with how the place is managed. The narrator probably believes that the animal could have been given a better chance at life if more effort had been put into finding it a home. 3. Overlooking potential adopters: The narrator's experience suggests that the shelter might not be doing an adequate job of matching animals with potential adopters. The narrator adopted their cat despite its antisocial behavior, yet another, similar animal was euthanized. The manager might not be putting enough effort into finding suitable homes for the animals. In all these steps, the management's insensitivity and perceived inadequacy in handling the animals seem to be the primary reasons behind the narrator's unhappiness with the facility. The narrator likely feels that the animals deserve better care and attention, and that the management could be doing more to improve their chances of finding a loving home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Bees go out during the day and gather food - Then while gathering of their food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive - Bees make food called honey - They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together - Bees produce all of the building blocks to build their hive in their own body -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are fewer bees happens, how will it affect more honey will be created.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If there are fewer bees, it will have a direct effect on the amount of honey created, as well as indirect effects on the overall process of building the hive and maintaining its structure. 1. Direct effect on honey production: With fewer bees, there will be fewer workers to forage for nectar, which is the main ingredient for honey. This means less nectar will be collected, and subsequently, less honey will be produced. The amount of honey created depends on the size and efficiency of the bee population. 2. Indirect effects on the building and maintenance of the hive: a. Less wax production: With fewer bees, there will be fewer workers to produce wax, which is essential for building the hive structure, including cells for larvae, honey storage, and pollen storage. This may lead to difficulties in expanding the colony and providing enough space for new bees, resources, and brood. b. Difficulty in maintaining hive temperature: A large group of bees is necessary to maintain a constant temperature within the hive, especially during colder months. With fewer bees, it will be more difficult to regulate the temperature, which could affect the survival of the larvae and the health of the entire colony. c. Reduced defense capabilities: Fewer bees mean fewer defenders to protect the hive from predators or invasions by other bees. This could lead to higher mortality rates, loss of resources, or even complete collapse of the hive. d. Negative impact on surrounding ecosystem: Bees are essential pollinators, and a reduction in their population can have negative consequences for plant reproduction and the overall ecological balance of their habitat. This might lead to a decreased availability of nectar and other resources, further affecting honey production and colony health. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of having fewer bees would have profound effects on honey production and the overall health of the hive and surrounding ecosystem. Honey production would be directly affected due to less foraging, along with indirect consequences on the building, maintenance, and defense of the hive, which are essential elements in the bees' lifecycle and survival."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following plot summary has been simplified and thus does not reflect the exact sequence of the events on screen. Morocco[edit] In a desert in Morocco, Abdullah, a goatherder, buys a .270 Winchester M70 rifle and a box of ammunition from his neighbor Hassan Ibrahim to shoot the jackals that have been preying on his goats. Abdullah gives the rifle to his two young sons, Yussef and Ahmed, and sends them out to tend the herd. Ahmed, the older of the two, criticises Yussef for spying on his sister while she changes her clothes. Doubtful of the rifle's purported three-kilometer range, they decide to test it out, aiming first at rocks, a moving car on a highway below, and then at a bus carrying Western tourists. Yussef's bullet hits the bus, critically wounding Susan Jones (Cate Blanchett), an American woman from San Diego who is traveling with her husband Richard (Brad Pitt) on vacation.[3] The two boys realize what has happened and flee the scene, hiding the rifle in the hills. Glimpses of television news programs reveal that the US government considers the shooting a terrorist act and is pressuring the Moroccan government to apprehend the culprits. Having traced the rifle back to Hassan, the Moroccan police descend on his house and roughly question him and his wife until they reveal that the rifle was given to him by a Japanese man, and then sold to Abdullah. The two boys see the police on the road and confess to their father what they have done, believing at the time that the American woman has died of her wounds. The three flee from their house, retrieving the rifle as they go. The police corner them on the rocky slope of a hill and open fire. After Ahmed is hit in the leg, Yussef returns fire, striking one police officer in the shoulder. The police continue shooting, hitting Ahmed in the back, possibly fatally injuring him.

It is a tradition that has been cherished since ancient times, but as social mobility increases in modern times, the road to family reunions has become very uneasy.

The full scale of violence and corruption in Libya since the fall of Colonel Gaddafi has been laid bare in an Amnesty International report accusing the world of 'turning a blind eye' to  war crimes. Since the dictator's death in October 2011, the then Western-backed rebel groups have split into two  rival camps - one based on hardline Islamist ideology and the other a largely secular faction. Amnesty has now accused both groups of 'running amok' and using armed gangs to torture and murder their rivals, saying the feuding militias have 'committed a wave of abductions targeting civilians based on their origins or perceived political allegiance'. The human rights organisation added that the international community is choosing to ignore the 'chaos engulfing Libya' however, saying the option to punish those responsible for potential crimes against humanity is available to the International Criminal Court, but has simply not been taken up. Conflict: Libyan military soldiers fire their weapons during clashes with Islamist militias in Benghazi yesterday. Masked: A Libyan regime solider takes cover during clashes with Islamist militants in Benghazi yesterday. Colonel Gaddafi died after the UN security council approved bombing raids led by Britain, France and the U.S. designed to assist rebel militias battling against forces loyal to Gaddafi on the ground. He was eventually captured and shot dead by the victorious rebels in 2011. But threat of extreme violence has remained near-constant presence in Libya since the civil war came to an end three years ago, as the once relatively united rebel militias struggle to find common ground on the extent to which  religion should play a role in rebuilding the country. The deep ideological divisions have led to both sides committing human rights abuses in the subsequent battle for power, Amnesty International claims in its latest report. Detained: A suspected Islamist militant is arrested by forces loyal to the Libyan regime in Benghazi. A soldier loyal to the Libyan regime fires at Islamists using a machine gun mounted on a pick-up truck. 'Armed groups have tortured - and probably summarily killed - detainees in their custody, and have committed a wave of abductions targeting civilians based on their origins or perceived political allegiance,' the report explains. 'Likewise, satellite images released today by Amnesty show that fighters on all sides in the conflict have displayed an utter disregard for civilian lives, launching indiscriminate rocket and artillery fire into crowded civilian neighbourhoods,' the human rights group added. Amnesty cited specific accounts from Libyans caught up in the conflict - particularly in two cities key to the overthrow of Gaddafi in 2011, Misurata and Zintan. While militia in Misurata are backed by Islamist groups linked to Ansar al-Sharia - the organisation accused of the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens, fighters in Zintan are allied with the fledling Libyan regime, now based in the city of Tobruk. Fighting: A Libyan regime soldier fires at Islamists in Benghazi yesterday. Only three years ago the groups fought side by side during a civil war that led to the death of dictator Colonel Gaddafi. A soldier loyal to the Libyan regime loads his gun before setting off to fight Islamists in Benghazi. Rebels from Misurata and other Islamist-dominated towns seized Libya's capital Tripoli in August, finally forcing divisions between the rival groups into open warfare. The North African country has had two governments and parliaments since a militia group seized the capital, setting up its own cabinet and assembly. Since then there have been accusations of tit-for-tat kidnappings in the areas around Misurata and Zintan - with detainees from either side saying they have been savagely beaten and tortured. Amnesty says photographs of corpses suggest a number of men taken captive were later murdered by the feuding militia, adding that others remain missing and are presumed dead. Amnesty's report concludes that not enough is being done by the West to bring an end to the violence, adding that the option to punish those responsible for potential crimes against humanity is available to the International Criminal Court, but has simply not been taken up. 'The international community has largely turned a blind eye to the chaos engulfing Libya since the 2011 uprising,' the report claims. A Foreign Office spokesman told the Telegraph that Britain remains committed to playing its part in Libya, and is helping to negotiate an 'essential' political settlement between the rival groups. Libya has had two governments and parliaments since an Islamist militia group seized the capital, Tripoli, setting up its own cabinet and assembly. Pictured is Benghazi during clashes yesterday. Western powers worry that the Libya is heading towards another civil war as authorities are too weak to control Islamists defying the state's authority in order to grab power and a share of oil revenues. This morning Libya's internationally-recognised Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni said he was ready for peace talks with Islamist groups controlling Tripoli,as fresh fighting in Benghazi killed 20 people. Thinni set one condition for talks with his rivals, however. 'We open the doors of dialogue with our brothers on the condition that there be concessions from all sides,' he told reporters in Khartoum at the end of a three-day visit to Sudan. His comments were more conciliatory than recent statements when he had vowed to liberate Tripoli militarily, a plan analysts say is unrealistic as the weak government forces are no match for better-equipped rebels. Western powers worry that the Libya is heading towards another civil war as authorities are too weak to control Islamists defying the state's authority in order to grab power and a share of oil revenues.

The report concludes that the international community, and the West in particular, is not doing enough to quell the violence in Libya. It suggests that the International Criminal Court has the ability to step in and punish those responsible for possible crimes against humanity, but has not acted. 8. There is increasing concern among Western powers that Libya may descend into civil war due to the inability of authorities to control Islamist factions looking to seize power and a share of oil revenues. 9.

Sentence 1: Information wanting to be free doesn't seem so appealing when it includes details about all your own flesh and frailties--credit history, shopping habits, records of where you've been, what you asked for, and what you took. Sentence 2: Free information does not seem welcomed when it contains your own personal data. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Yes, the second sentence can be considered true if we assume the first sentence is true. Let's break down the reasoning behind this answer. The first sentence suggests that the concept of \\"information wanting to be free\\" could become less appealing when it involves sharing personal details. These personal details include credit history, shopping habits, records of your whereabouts, and other potentially sensitive information. We can infer that the speaker in this sentence values their privacy and might feel less comfortable with the notion of free information if it means that their personal data will be exposed to others. On the other hand, the idea of \\"information wanting to be free\\" generally promotes transparency and openness, making it more difficult for individuals to keep their personal information hidden. The second sentence is essentially a reworded and more concise version of the first sentence. It emphasizes that free information might not be as welcomed when it contains a person's own personal data. This statement is in line with the concerns expressed in the first sentence regarding the potential consequences of the free flow of information. Both sentences share the same underlying idea that the appeal of free information is diminished when it includes personal and potentially sensitive information about an individual. Therefore, if we consider the first sentence to be true, we can also consider the second sentence to be true, as they essentially convey the same sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In which English county could you visit the 'Museum of Witchcraft', the 'Barbara Hepworth Museum' and the 'King Edward Mining Museum'? Answer:","output":"The English county where you can visit the 'Museum of Witchcraft', the 'Barbara Hepworth Museum' and the 'King Edward Mining Museum' is Cornwall.  Cornwall is an idyllic county located in the far west of Great Britain, known for its scenic coastlines and rich cultural heritage. Visitors flock to this region to bask in its natural beauty, enjoy its vibrant arts scene, and delve into the area's historical and mythological past. Three of the unique attractions that stand out in Cornwall are the 'Museum of Witchcraft', the 'Barbara Hepworth Museum' and the 'King Edward Mining Museum'. Nestled in the village of Boscastle, the Museum of Witchcraft and Magic is one of the most intriguing cultural hotspots of Cornwall. Opened in 1961 by Cecil Williamson, the museum houses an extensive collection of witchcraft-related artifacts and memorabilia. Displaying items like magical objects, photographs, and documents relating to witchcraft, this museum offers a fascinating insight into the world of magic, paganism, and Wicca. On the other hand, the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden in St Ives transports visitors into the creative world of one of Britain's most important 20th-century artists. Established by Hepworth herself before her death in 1975, her workspace was transformed into a museum displaying a range of her sculptures and paintings. The adjoining garden, where sculpture displays are set amidst plants and trees, enhances the dramatic effect of the artist's work. Located in the area famously known as the Cornish Mining World Heritage Site, the King Edward Mine Museum gives the visitors a glimpse into Cornwall's rich mining history. King Edward Mine originally started as a training facility for students at Camborne School of Mines. The museum showcases extraction methods and technologies used in the past. With several original buildings and machinery, the museum provides a comprehensive understanding of the region’s mining industry. Therefore, a visit to these three museums in Cornwall is like taking a journey through time - from understanding the ancient craft practiced in secret, appreciating the creativity of a renowned artist, to getting a clear picture of an industry that once formed the backbone of the region. This is indeed a testament to the vibrant and diverse cultural heritage of Cornwall, making it a perfect destination for explorers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The health-care economy is filled with unusual and even unique economic relationships. One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or \\"provider\\" and purchaser or \\"consumer\\" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry. In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return \\"next Wednesday\\", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious. This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real \\"consumer\\". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the \\"power center\\" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration. Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bills generated by the... Question: The author is most probably leading up to   _  .

Article: A young woman went to her mother and told her how hard life was. She was tired of struggling and fighting and wanted to give up. So, her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed coffee beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a word. In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out, pulled the eggs out and then poured the coffee into three different bowls. Turning to her daughter, she asked, \\"Tell me what you see.\\" \\"Carrots, eggs, and coffee,\\" she replied. Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard boiled egg. Finally, the daughter was asked to drink the coffee. She smiled as she tasted its rich fragrance. The daughter then asked, \\"What does it mean, mother?\\" Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same disaster but reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, and hard.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.  Question: \\"What year was Japan founded\\" Answer: \\"660 BC\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Use evidence from the fact that cows only eat plants to answer this question: \\"Herbivores like to dine on\\"","output":"Herbivores like to dine on plant-based materials. The term 'herbivore' refers to any creature that subsists on a plant-based diet, with 'herb' signifying 'plant' and 'vore' meaning 'to eat.' Herbivorous creatures fall into two major categories: frugivores, who eat mostly fruit, and folivores, who consume predominantly leaves. Some herbivores also eat seeds, roots, and bark. For proof of this claim, consider the dietary habits of cows, known herbivores. Evidence-based research has indicated that cows are definitive herbivores with strong preferences for grasses. However, they are adaptable and can also survive on other types of plant materials. Let's go deeper into their dietary habits. Cows are ruminant animals, meaning that they have a uniquely specialized digestive system that allows for the successful digestion of plant materials, specifically grasses and legumes. Ruminants are characterized by their four-chambered stomach, which includes the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. When a cow eats, it partially chews the food just enough to mix it with its saliva which is then swallowed and stored in the rumen, the first section of the cow's four-chambered stomach. The rumen can hold an astonishing 50 gallons of plant material. Once stored in the rumen, microorganisms (including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa) help to break down cellulose, a primary component of plant cell walls, which is indigestible to many animals. This compartment also allows for fermentation, which releases nutrients called volatile fatty acids, which the cow uses for energy. The process doesn't end there. The cow then regurgitates this 'cud' back into its mouth, chews it again, and swallows it for the second time. Upon the second swallowing, the food moves to the other three sections of the stomach (reticulum, omasum, and abomasum), where further digestion occurs with the aid of enzymes. The anatomy and physiology of a cow's digestive system is a clear form of evolutionary adaptation to an herbivorous diet. This capacity to process and breakdown plant matter, particularly that which is high in cellulose, is what makes cows such successful herbivores.  In addition to grasses, cows also consume legumes like clover and alfalfa, given their higher protein content. They may also eat other plant materials, such as leaves, stems, grains, and even bark during difficult times. This range of plant-based diet is another indication of their nature as herbivores. In conclusion, herbivores such as cows like to dine on plants, which is demonstrated by their physiological adaptations, including highly specialized teeth for grinding plant matter, a multi-chambered stomach for fermenting and digesting cellulose, and a large intestine capable of extracting remaining nutrients from plant-based materials. From grass and legumes to various types of plant material in more challenging periods, the evidence-based diet of cows supports the conclusion that herbivores feast predominantly on plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For example, observing the girls' interactions, such as laughing at the same time after receiving a message, or looking at each other's phones and reacting to the messages they receive, could give us a better insight into their texting behaviors. However, even such observations might not provide definitive proof, as the girls could respond this way to messages from other friends or groups.

What is the answer: Which Shakespeare play of 1591 opens with the funeral of King Henry V?","output":"The Shakespeare play that opens with the funeral of King Henry V is \\"Henry VI, Part 1.\\" Written around 1591, this historical play is the first in the series of three plays chronicling the life, challenges, and reign of King Henry VI of England. Henry VI, Part 1 begins with the funeral ceremony of King Henry V, held at Westminster Abbey. At the ceremony, the attendees mourn the untimely death of the great and united King Henry V. The nobles present express their concern and regret for the vulnerable state of England due to the young age of the new king, Henry VI, who is just an infant when he inherits the throne. The combination of a young king and internal strife leads to political instability, setting the stage for the events that unfold during the play. Henry VI, Part 1 falls into the broader War of the Roses narrative, which encompasses four of Shakespeare's historical plays, including \\"Richard II,\\" \\"Henry IV, Part 1,\\" \\"Henry IV, Part 2,\\" and \\"Henry V.\\" The War of the Roses was a series of civil wars fought in England between the Houses of Lancaster and York for the throne during the 15th century. The play depicts the beginning of these conflicts and follows Henry VI's rule during England's loss of territories in France, as well as the power struggles and rivalry between the English nobility that weaken the nation. Throughout the play, we witness the rise of several prominent characters, including Joan la Pucelle (Joan of Arc), who leads the French resistance against the English invaders. The play portrays Joan of Arc as a witch and a heretic, which was loaded with political undertones and reflective of British sentiment towards France at the time. Additionally, we see the internal fight for power between the English factions - the House of York represented by the white rose and the House of Lancaster represented by the red rose. Another crucial aspect of \\"Henry VI, Part 1\\" is Henry VI's character development. The play exposes the idealism and weakness of the young king, whose inexperience led him to depend on the advice of his more seasoned council members. Henry VI's inability to effectively govern and his eventual marriage to the cunning, manipulative Margaret of Anjou sets the stage for the events in the subsequent parts the \\"Henry VI\\" trilogy, as well as the downfall of the House of Lancaster. In conclusion, \\"Henry VI, Part 1\\" is a Shakespeare play, written around 1591, which opens with the funeral of King Henry V. The play dives into the political machinations and the beginning of the War of the Roses, centered around the rule of the young and inexperienced King Henry VI. It weaves together historical events and political commentary, shedding light on the turbulent times in England and the complex personalities that shaped the nation's history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Meet the Guardians of the Galaxy In the last several years, moviegoers have grown accustomed to seeing Marvel characters pull off one superheroic feat after another. Iron Man swoops in to rescue 13 hapless souls plummeting to their doom after a fall from Air Force One. High-flying Captain America skips the parachute as he foils insidious plans for a Helicarrier fleet to decimate the planet’s population. Iron Man, Cap, Thor, and the rest of the Avengers band together to save New York from being annihilated by invading alien hordes. But in the cosmic action romp “Guardians of the Galaxy,” opening Friday, another group of Marvel heroes is vying to record the greatest feat of all: making a blockbuster draw out of a property that’s had a limited profile even among comics fans. Before Marvel’s current run of self-produced screen successes, you’d hear industry speculation that, say, “Iron Man” might struggle because the character wasn’t known to audiences, and lacked the iconic heft of Batman or Spider-Man. Which was a stretch, of course — Iron Man was a name that registered with the mainstream on some level, even if somewhat confusedly, thanks to triathlons and the old Black Sabbath tune. Jay Maidment (c) Marvel 2014 “Guardians,” by contrast, is genuinely unfamiliar, the unlikeliest Marvel property to get a big-screen push since “Blade,” in the late ’90s. Back then, Marvel was a bankruptcy-bailout case aspiring to get into the movie game. Now the company is a Disney-owned powerhouse willing to gamble that its brand trumps its secondary characters’ visibility, or lack thereof. “Guardians” is headlined by Chris Pratt (“Parks and Recreation), as Peter Quill, a.k.a. Star-Lord, a spacefaring thief-turned-good guy with Earth roots and more than a touch of Han Solo roguishness. Aside from maybe “Moneyball,” in which Pratt played Red Sox castoff and A’s reclamation project Scott Hatteberg, he’s never had a gig this unexpected — as befits the movie, really. (Next up: the franchise relaunch “Jurassic World,” due in 2015.) Star-Lord’s scruffy compadres include green-skinned assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana, swapping her blue “Avatar” avatar for a Margaret Hamilton makeover); brawny, butt-kicking Drax the Destroyer (WWE vet Dave Bautista); and CG creations Rocket, a wisecracking, gun-toting raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper, and Groot, an anthropomorphic, monosyllabic tree voiced by Vin Diesel. Never heard of this bunch of self-proclaimed Guardians? Neither had comics readers until just a few years ago. The Guardians of the Galaxy were first introduced by Marvel in 1969, but in a completely different incarnation, one which spent as much time as a guest-starring sidelight as it did in the spotlight. Geeks of a certain age will recall that the group even got loosely folded into the “Avengers” comics for a time. Then, in 2008, Marvel creators repurposed the Guardians moniker, slapping it onto a collection of editorially discarded characters like Star-Lord. They would lend the entire enterprise an increasingly freewheeling tone, the sort you could get away with when you weren’t dealing with Spider-Man and other characters of corporate significance. And why not? Even the name Peter Quill was originally a bit of subversive slang for, um, jerk, as Sean Howe, author of “Marvel Comics: The Untold Story,” notes in an entertaining “Guardians” primer on Vulture.com. The reconceived team was a good fit for a couple of items highlighted on Marvel’s creative checklist. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has spoken passionately about how much the company had wanted to do a big, cosmic epic. Fans were already primed for space action by an “Avengers” end-credits teaser featuring intergalactic baddie Thanos. (The character doesn’t figure into next year’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” but he’s a presence in “Guardians,” and Josh Brolin, who tackles the role, has a multi-picture deal with Marvel. Stay tuned for “Avengers 3.”) Film Frame (c) Marvel 2014 Glenn Close as Nova Prime. Along with changing up its movie backdrops a bit, Marvel seems intent on trying some tonal change-ups — specifically, by dabbling in action-comedy. Yes, “Iron Man” has Robert Downey Jr., but that’s more like an improv cherry on the franchise’s action sundae. “Guardians” feels shaggier, starting with trailers that sample Blue Swede’s “Hooked on a Feeling” and poke fun at that low profile. (Pratt to funky alien Djimon Hounsou: “[I’m] Star-Lord.” Hounsou: “Who?”) The film is directed and co-written by James Gunn, a fanboy pro whose credits include genre spoofs “Super” and “The Specials.” And as Marvel follows up “Avengers 2” with what it bills as Phase Three of its film slate, we’ll also be seeing Paul Rudd in, yep, “Ant-Man.” That one is being directed by comedy vet Peyton Reed, who signed on after Edgar Wright dropped out. One rationale for Pratt’s casting reportedly was the prospect that the Guardians and the Avengers could one day meet onscreen. You never know — Tony Stark already hangs with Star-Lord’s crew in the comics. “If . . . this actor is talking to Robert Downey Jr.,” Gunn recently told Entertainment Weekly, “I wanted him to give as good as he got.” By that point, maybe the exchange won’t even have to open with, “Who?” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Guardians of the Galaxy are a group of superhero characters from the Marvel series of comic books and movies. They consist of Star-Lord, a space thief-turned-hero, Gamora, a green-skinned assassin, Drax the Destroyer, a strong fighter, Rocket, a talking raccoon, and Groot, a talking tree."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: While there are some general signs used to identify gender dysphoria, it's not cut-and-dry, and everyone experiences it differently. Some people identify their true gender in early childhood, whereas others don't recognize it until puberty or adulthood. Some people experience severe and distressing dysphoria, while others experience it minimally or not at all. There's no one \\"right\\" way for someone to experience dysphoria, so gender dysphoria can be difficult to identify, and it may take time to figure it out.  Gender dysphoria can exist in anyone who's not cisgender, including nonbinary people.  If you're trying to determine whether you're experiencing gender dysphoria, you may find it beneficial to look at forums and social media sites for transgender and nonbinary people, read various people's experiences to see if you relate to them, and read articles such as How to Know if You Are Transgender. . It's not unusual for children to experiment with gender, such as by wanting to be called by another name during play. However, if a child consistently asserts that they are a gender other than the one they were assigned, or resists behavior or presentation associated with the gender they don't identify with, they may have gender dysphoria. Signs of gender dysphoria or gender variance in a child include:  A repeated desire to be the other sex or an assertion that they are the other sex A belief that their assigned sex will change on its own (e.g. thinking they'll grow a penis or that their penis will come off when they get older) Wanting to change their name to a name typically associated with another gender, or a gender-neutral name A preference for presenting as another gender (e.g. a child assigned male at birth who prefers long hair and wearing dresses, or a child assigned female at birth who prefers short hair and wearing gender-neutral clothing) Resistance or distress when made to present as a gender they don't identify with (such as a \\"girl\\" throwing a tantrum over having to wear a dress or a \\"boy\\" crying after having to get a haircut) Assuming the role of another gender in fantasy games or make-believe An intense desire to participate in the games and activities typical of another gender (such as an assigned-male child playing with Barbie and an assigned-female child playing contact sports) A preference for playmates of another gender Gender dysphoria often becomes more apparent during puberty, since hormonal changes and physical changes are occurring, and a preteen or teen who previously didn't question their gender identity may suddenly feel confused or distressed about the changes. Signs of gender dysphoria in adolescence include:  Feelings of panic or severe discomfort concerning puberty and bodily changes (e.g. refusing to acknowledge or admit changes are occurring, refusing to look at their body, or becoming distressed or uncomfortable with body development, menstruation, or ejaculation) Discomfort or distress with certain forms of gender presentation, such as disliking long hair or certain types of clothing Increased bullying at school due to differences in acting out one’s perceived gender or lack of self-confidence Isolation from peers due to lack of connection or fear of bullying Depression and/or anxiety as a result of confusion over gender identity or not fitting in with peers Be aware that some adolescents may try to repress their true gender due to outside pressure, such as from family and peers, even if they previously expressed their true gender as a child. Often, gender dysphoria remains hidden or unrecognized until adulthood due to the learned gender behaviors that are taught to both children and adolescents by their family and peers. Some signs of gender dysphoria in adults include:  A difference between the sex at birth and the gender the individual expresses or experiences Consistently identifying with a gender other than the one matching the sex they were assigned (for an official diagnosis of gender dysphoria, this must have been ongoing for at least six months) Constant daydreaming or \\"what if...\\" thoughts about being another gender Wanting to be treated as another gender, or disliking being treated as the gender others perceive them as (e.g. being uncomfortable when addressed as \\"sir\\" or \\"ma'am\\") Wanting to remove, alter, or hide their sex characteristics (however, this is not present in all transgender or nonbinary people) The individual may feel that they act in ways typical of another gender. If gender dysphoria has been deeply repressed or buried, it may have resulted in mental health problems. Take note of any history of anxiety or depression, self-injurious behavior, or substance abuse, and whether these problems lessen or even disappear when they present as their true gender; these can be subtle indicators of dysphoria. Gender dysphoria can be difficult to identify, and some people don't experience it; however, many transgender or nonbinary people experience gender euphoria, which is described as positive feelings when their true gender is affirmed and validated. Even if the person doesn't feel their assigned sex is wrong, they may feel that presenting as a different gender is right, instead. Some signs of gender euphoria are:  Feeling happy or excited when addressed as their true gender Feeling relieved after identifying their gender Joy or excitement when presenting in a way that aligns with their gender (e.g. wearing a bra or cutting their hair short) A feeling of peace with their body when transitioning socially or medically","output":"The article discusses the varying experiences of gender dysphoria among individuals, along with signs and indicators in children, adolescents, and adults, emphasizing the importance of understanding and validating one's true gender identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Run some water from your sink into the bucket, leaving 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of space at the top to make the bucket easier to carry without sloshing. It’s best to use warm or lukewarm water, as it will be closer in temperature to the water that was already in the tank previously.  Use whatever water source is closest to your aquarium to cut down on the distance you’ll have to tote the bucket back and forth. You may need to fill the bucket multiple times if you’re replacing the water in a particularly large tank. Refer to bottle of the product you choose for more detailed directions. Most of the time, it will only take 1-2 drops per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water to successfully chlorine, chloramine, ammonia, nitrite, and other chemicals and impurities. If left untreated, the chemicals in tap water could wipe out whole colonies of good bacteria, or even harm your goldfish itself. Carefully lift the bucket over the edge of the tank and tilt it so that it flows in little by little. When refilling a large tank, wait 5-10 minutes before adding every next bucket to give the water time to reach a consistent temperature. Continue until you’ve replenished the water to its original level.  If you’ve got a thermometer in your tank, look for it to reach a minimum of 60 °F (16 °C) before adding more water. Goldfish are most comfortable at around 65–72 °F (18–22 °C). Unless the water is near room temperature, it may be too cold or too warm for your goldfish.  Raising or lowering the temperature in the tank drastically could \\"shock\\" your goldfish, leaving it vulnerable to disease. Now that your aquarium is clean, all that’s left to do is reactivate the filter, heater, and air pump. If possible, let everything run for about 20 minutes to bring the water temperature and oxygen back to their optimal levels. Afterwards, return your goldfish to the tank and welcome it home with a snack! Remember to plug your goldfish tank back into the nearest wall outlet. Summary:","output":"When replacing water in an aquarium, fill a bucket with lukewarm water from the nearest water source, leaving some space at the top for easier carrying.

Carefully pour the treated water into the tank, waiting 5-10 minutes between large refills for consistent temperature. Ensure the water temperature is between 65-72°F (18-22°C) to avoid shocking the goldfish. Once the water is replenished, reactivate the filter, heater, and air pump, and let them run for about 20 minutes to stabilize the water temperature and oxygen levels.

Article: A few years ago, in one experiment in behavioural psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects for their willingness to obey instructions given by a \\"leader\\" in a situation in which the subjects might feel a personal dislike of the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer \\"teacher-subject\\" that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn. The teacher-subjects were placed before a panel of thirty switches with labels ranging from \\"15 volts of electricity (slight shock)\\" to \\"450 volts (danger -- severe shock)\\" in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered. The supposed \\"pupil\\" was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to pretend to receive the shocks by giving out cries and screams. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for. As the experiment unfolded, the \\"pupil\\" would deliberately give the wrong answers to questions, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects _ administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram. In these situations, Milgram calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to carry on with the experiment and that it was important for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end. What Milgram was trying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer the highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong personal and moral revulsion  against the rules and conditions of the experiment. Before carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39 psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people... Question: Why did Milgram do the experiment? - To discover people's willingness for orders from leaders. - To display the power of punishment on ability to learn. - To test people's willingness to sacrifice for science. - To explore the biological basis of social behavior. Answer:","output":"Stanley Milgram conducted the experiment to discover people's willingness to obey orders from leaders, even when they personally disagreed with the actions they were asked to perform.

Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Portuguese. Your job is to translate the Portuguese sentence into Farsi. Problem:Na realidade, não sabemos se está hipótese está correcta, devido ao facto de nunca termos tido tecnologias poderosas o suficiente para testá-la. Solution:","output":"در حقیقت، ما نمی دانیم که این فرضیه درست است یا خیر، زیرا هیچ‌گاه تکنولوژی های قدرتمند کافی برای آزمودن آن نداشته ایم. Step 1: Identify the sentence's structure and main components in Portuguese. The sentence structure is fairly simple: \\"Na realidade, não sabemos se está hipótese está correcta, devido ao facto de nunca termos tido tecnologias poderosas o suficiente para testá-la.\\" Step 2: Translate individual components of the sentence into Farsi. Na realidade = در حقیقت não sabemos = ما نمی‌دانیم se = که está hipótese = این فرضیه está correcta = درست است devido ao facto de = زیرا nunca = هیچ‌گاه termos tido = داشته‌ایم tecnologias poderosas = تکنولوژی‌های قدرتمند o suficiente = کافی para testá-la = برای آزمودن آن Step 3: Assemble the translated components into a coherent Farsi sentence. Now that we have translated each component, we need to form a complete Farsi sentence by respecting the appropriate syntax and grammar. در حقیقت، ما نمی‌دانیم (Na realidade, não sabemos) که (se) این فرضیه (está hipótese) درست است (está correcta) یا خیر، زیرا (devido ao facto de) هیچ‌گاه (nunca) تکنولوژی های قدرتمند (tecnologias poderosas) کافی (o suficiente) برای آزمودن آن (para testá-la) نداشته‌ایم (termos tido). After assembling the components, I have made a few adjustments to the word order and the Persian sentence now reads as follows: در حقیقت، ما نمی دانیم که این فرضیه درست است یا خیر، زیرا هیچ‌گاه تکنولوژی های قدرتمند کافی برای آزمودن آن نداشته ایم."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Despite its rather salacious title, this is a light teen dramedy. Unless you're an old coot, you'll probably find it likeable. It isn't so good on developing characters or situations smoothly, though. When you view it, you get the feeling that you've been running back and forth to the kitchen even if you've been sitting down watching the whole time. This is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters, and they are appealing enough. Jennifer Connelly is the heartthrob of many, I know, but I've always liked the more obscure Maddie Corman.

Pick your answer from: 1). negative 2). positive","output":"The correct sentiment for the given movie review is 2). positive. Justifying the steps: 1. Read the review carefully to understand the emotions and sentiments expressed by the reviewer. 2. Noted that the review starts off with a sort of neutral tone: Despite the title, the reviewer considers it a light teen dramedy, suggesting it doesn't take itself too seriously and isn't overly dramatic. 3. The reviewer points out a few flaws (\\"It isn't so good on developing characters or situations smoothly\\"), which gives a slight negative sentiment. 4. The reviewer then mentions a slightly disoriented feeling when viewing the movie, giving a sense of negative sentiment. But this is immediately followed by the statement that the movie \\"counts a great deal on your liking the characters, and they are appealing enough\\", tipping the sentiment back towards positive. 5. Near the end, the reviewer shows preference for some characters, mentioning that they've liked them, and comments on the young cast getting screen time. This leans the sentiment towards positive too. 6. Overall, even with some criticisms, the review shows a somewhat favorable view of the movie primarily due to the likable characters, enough to be classified as a positive sentiment. The criticisms read more like neutral observations rather than strong disapproval, and they're outweighed by the positive statements.  Given the above, the correct sentiment of this review is positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Context: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS: Is primary Arterio-venous fistula the vascular access of choice for adequate dialysis and better patient outcome in end stage renal disease.', 'The present study was done in the department of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery at Sher-i-Kashmir institute of medical sciences, Soura, Srinagar Kashmir. Native Arterio-Venous (AV) fistulas were made in the patients with end stage renal disease for performing hemodialysis. They were followed for patency and adequacy of blood flow during hemodialysis. All the patients were operated under local anesthesia.', 'The results showed that 77% of the AV fistulas based on radial artery with side-to-side anastomosis and 80% of those with end-to-side anastomosis were functionally patent after one year. After two years, the patency rate in side-to-side and end-to-side anastomosis was 50% and 55%, respectively. In addition, the patency rate was 90% in brachial artery based AV fistula with end-to-side anastomosis, whether done primarily or secondarily, at the end of one year.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: This article: Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry.  Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the region that supports supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp industry?, what is it ? A:","output":"The name of the region that supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry is not explicitly mentioned in the given article. However, considering the details provided about mangrove species, fisheries, and the mention of the Everglades, we can deduce that the region in question is likely located in Florida, particularly within or near the Florida Everglades, which contains extensive mangrove forests and plays a crucial role in supporting the marine ecosystem in the area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help.

Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Mike Dawes. Reece Lyne's late try made the difference as Wakefield Trinity Wildcats stunned defending First Utility Super League champions Wigan to record their first win over the Warriors since 2009. A youthful Wigan side without the likes of Sean O'Loughlin, John Bateman and Matty Bowen played their part in an excellent match but ultimately fell to a 36-28 defeat. Wakefield edged an entertaining first half which swung one way then the other thanks to tries from Danny Kirmond, Tim Smith, Richard Owen and Richard Moore. Jack Hughes, Liam Farrell and Anthony Gelling crossed during a purple patch for Wigan, who had the first word in the second period as Farrell went over again. Paul Sykes made it five from five with the boot to give the Wildcats the lead but it was short-lived, Dan Sarginson putting Wigan back in the box seat. Purple patch: Jack Hughes bursts away from the defence to score during a spell of Wigan dominance. Danny Washbrook's try moved Wakefield back ahead and Lyne went over four minutes from time to claim the win and knock Wigan off top spot. Warriors hooker George Williams went closest to breaking the deadlock after a tight opening 15 minutes when he was adjudged to have knocked the ball on reaching for the line. It was Wakefield who took the lead as Kirmond took a short ball from Tim Smith close to the Warriors line and crashed over. The Wildcats were almost in again from the restart but Chris Riley was unable to hold onto the ball after a break by Lyne. Riley's error proved costly as Hughes took a flat pass from Matty Smith and showed a good turn of pace to beat Richard Mathers to the line. Wigan were in again from the restart courtesy of Liam Farrell's try on the back of a surging run by Jack Murphy, who was making his first appearance of the season. It looked as if the writing was on the wall for Wakefield when Gelling showed good athleticism to collect Matty Smith's high kick and touch down. Wigan-bound Taulima Tautai was on receiving end of a dangerous tackle by Liam Farrell in an incident which saw the Warriors forward put on report and Wakefield took full advantage as Tim Smith jinked his way over. The hosts were back on level terms when Skyes converted after Owen finished from 40 metres out following a bit of magic by Pita Godinet. Wakefield had the momentum and they retook the lead on the stroke of half-time when Moore crashed onto Godinet's pass from dummy half to power over. Tautai was denied a try at the start of the second half after referee George Stokes penalised the Wildcats for obstruction and they were quickly on the back foot, Liam Farrell crossing for his second try after half-backs Matty Smith and Sam Powell combined. A Sykes penalty edged Wakefield ahead with just over a quarter of the game to go but Wigan were back in front when Sarginson showed good footwork to score. Matty Smith's missed conversion ensured Wakefield had only a two-point deficit, which was wiped out thanks to Washbrook's close-range effort. Sykes missed a straightforward conversion before Murphy had a try ruled out for a forward pass. Wakefield decided against going for goal after a high tackle by Matty Smith and that decision was vindicated as Lyne finished on the back of a good offload by Sykes, who converted to seal a famous win. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"In this article, the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats win a very exciting game against the Wigan Warriors. The match had many exciting moments and lots of tries scored by both teams, but in the end, the Wakefield Wildcats won with a score of 36-28. This is their first win against the Warriors since 2009.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his..., can you guess it ?

Last, Last, Last Minute Tech Christmas Gifts It's never too late to get your Christmas shopping done. You just have to know a few tricks to procure the right procrastinator's presents. Here are a few really last-minute suggestions. Those who think e-mailed greeting cards are tacky and impersonal certainly aren't going to like the latest twist in holiday cheer, text messages with graphics. Initially intended to spice up mundane ASCII text emoticons with goofy graphics, messaging company Zlango is taking advantage of the silly season to offer Santa and Christmas themed mini digital cards. The texts plus graphics have fun or flirty icons and are sent directly to the recipient's phone. No envelopes, and no stamps, but regular messaging charges do apply. How does 9.99 for 14 million songs sound? That's the price of a one-month subscription gift card to the online music service MOG. It's a great idea for snobby music lovers who--let's face it--were never going to play that Katy Perry CD you were planning to give them. With this gift card they can satisfy their own musical tastes from Frank Sinatra to Frank Zappa and even download songs to a mobile phone or music player. The tracks expire when the subscription does, but you can also purchase a two-month card for 19.99. Competing music service Rdio is also offering gift cards, including a 10 offer for 6 weeks of access to its service. Best of all for tardy shoppers, you don't have to wait for them to be mailed out; the MOG and Rdio cards are available at Target stores around the country (so you could pick them up on Saturday). Hollywood may have turned out some duds this year (The Green Hornet, yikes), but there were plenty of good video game releases to fill the entertainment vacuum. For kids, my resident 9-year-old reviewer recommends Super Mario 3D Land (39.99) for the Nintendo 3DS. She loves it and points out that if you don't like the 3D effect, it can be turned off. For teens and up, there is one must-have title: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Available for Windows PCs (49.99), the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles (59.99), Skyrim finally delivers on something video games have promised for years: a completely absorbing virtual fantasy world where you are the main character. In Skyrim you can mold that character to suit your desires, imbuing it with a variety of skills, super powers, and characteristics that you can mix and match. There's an epic fantasy-style plot, but you can ignore it and spend dozens of hours infiltrating secret guilds, exploring the countryside, and slaying monsters. One warning: the PlayStation version has some glitches. A Box Instead of a TV The big flat panels with streaming online video services like Netflix and Hulu Plus may make shoppers drool, but who can afford one as a gift? Instead of upgrading the entire TV, just get a set top box that can deliver all those services -- and more -- for a fraction of the price of new set. Among the dozen or so different streaming media players you'll see in electronics stores, the best is the Roku 2 XS. For just 89.99 you'll get over 330 video and media services, from free services like Pandora to special interest channels like \\"Trigger Talk\\" for gun enthusiasts. It even comes with a game controller and a free version of Angry Birds to play on the big screen. Photos from an iPhone or simple point-and-shoot camera are fine for posting incriminating Facebook shots, but if you want to get some really good photos of your kids or of that incredible sunset, you need to use a real camera. That used to mean spending a lot--and learning a lot--to use a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera, but no more. There's a growing category of smaller, less technical but just as capable models called compact interchangeable lens cameras (or ILCs). These models are a step up to more serious photography, with better sensors, optics, full manual control, and, as the name suggests, lots of lens options should it turn into a hobby. Two of the best models in this category are the Olympus PEN E-P3 (899.99 with a 17mm lens package) and the Samsung NX200 (899.99 with a 18-55mm i-Function lens). Olympus has a faster processor for quicker auto focusing and shooting better HD video. It also has a built-in flash, and can use some compatible Panasonic lenses. The Samsung NX200 boasts a larger APS-C size sensor (the type favored in full DSLRs) that delivers some excellent image quality and color accuracy, but it doesn't have the number of optional lenses or accessories as the Olympus model. So now you have no excuse. There's a great last-minute tech gift available in every price range, and if you hurry, you might even make the cutoff for overnight shipping. What was this article about?","output":"This article provides last-minute tech Christmas gift ideas in various price ranges for different recipients, including text messages with graphics, music service subscriptions, video games, streaming media players, and compact interchangeable lens cameras. Suggestions include Zlango's holiday-themed mini digital cards, MOG and Rdio gift cards for music, video games like Super Mario 3D Land and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the Roku 2 XS set-top box, and Olympus PEN E-P3 and Samsung NX200 cameras."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist.

These six reviews can help in sorting through publishersâ recent offerings. Among them is a clever racing history meant for young children and adults; a compendium of stories, some very bizarre indeed, about cars and the people who collect them; an account of Mustangâs first five decades; and a travelogue of a bikerâs around-the-world journey. The Epic 1976 Formula 1 Season 59 color and 53 black-and-white photographs. 160 pages. David Bull Publishing. 39.95. This book appears to have been published to coincide with Ron Howardâs movie âRush,â which dramatizes the battle for the 1976 Formula One drivers championship between James Hunt of England and Niki Lauda of Austria. And ârushâ is what comes to mind when I think about the effort behind this book. The author needs quotation marks, it seems, only when mentioning various charactersâ nicknames. Itâs understandable that there are no direct statements from Hunt, who died in 1993 at 45, and perhaps even from Lauda, who may not have wanted to dredge up memories of a season that almost killed him. There are news clippings to quote from, though. And living witnesses. But none of the other people involved in that season (which saw Hunt win the title in the final race when Lauda refused to risk his life again on a very wet racetrack) are asked to provide their insights. Instead, we have Mr. Fearnley telling us what was going on in the minds of Hunt and Lauda, and we are asked to believe. Even the most rudimentary extras, like race-by-race results, are missing. And this book could have also used a glossary to translate Britishisms like âcouldnât test for toffeeâ and âa wizard wheeze.â The writing also suffers from a trait that frequently infests reporting on Formula One racing in the days when Il Commendatore, Enzo himself, was still running Ferrari: namely, all the various intrigues on the Italian team are described in darkly ominous terms befitting a âGodfatherâ novel. There are plenty of photos, color and black-and-white, to please students of racing history, with extensive captions. But if youâve seen the movie and now want to read the book, donât be in such a ... well, you know. JOSEPH SIANO Celebrating Americaâs Only True Pony Car By Donald Farr. Foreword by Edsel B. Ford II. 200 color and 200 black-and-white images. 256 pages. Motorbooks. 50. âMustang Fifty Yearsâ is a voluminous book that tracks the life of a Ford thatâs as famous as the Model T. While the book is presented as an Official Licensed Product, a spokesman for Ford said the automaker had no editorial control. Donald Farr, a longtime writer and editor at Mustang-centric publications, provides a comprehensive recounting of the carâs gestation as a design study in the early 1960s, its splashy debut at the 1964 New York Worldâs Fair and its tumultuous life up through the fifth-generation model that is entering its final model year. The book concludes with sections on Mustangs for racing, in pop culture and for hobbyists and collectors. The book takes a straightforward, generally noncritical approach in presenting each significant Mustang. If there are faults in any of the models, features or production decisions, they are usually presented in retrospect, with a recounting of how the new version addressed the shortcomings of the old. Even some universally scorned models, like the Mustang II of 1974-78, are presented with a faithful recitation of the companyâs list of its supposed virtues. While not exactly a beach read, the book is more digestible, even for general audiences, than its dauntingly encyclopedic appearance might suggest. The captions for the many interesting photos are even more compelling. JERRY GARRETT 692 color photographs and maps. 224 pages. Veloce Publishing. 59.95.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Finland has one of the lowest economic inequality in the world. Finland's neighbor Russia has a different story. After the collapse of Soviet Union, Russia's economic inequality soared to the point that it has now one of the highest economic inequality in the world. John and Keith are residents of Finland. While John is rich, Keith is not so fortunate - he is poor. Similarly, David and Greg are residents of Russia. While David is rich, Greg is in poverty.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would Greg have larger or smaller marginal utility than David?  Hint: Following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number – economic inequality is problematic. A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \\"distributive efficiency\\" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\\"the additional dollar\\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies[2][32] have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.","output":"In the given scenario, Greg, the poor resident of Russia, would have a larger marginal utility than David, the rich resident of Russia. The concept of marginal utility is rooted in the principle that the additional satisfaction or \\"utility\\" gained from consuming additional units of goods or services decreases as more units are consumed, which is also known as the law of diminishing marginal utility. To understand this concept better, let's look at Greg and David's situations. Greg, who is in poverty, would achieve significantly higher marginal utility from an additional dollar as it would help him acquire basic necessities, such as food, water, and healthcare. The acquisition of these necessities would greatly improve his quality of life, and therefore the additional dollar would provide a substantial increase in utility. On the other hand, David, who is already rich, would experience relatively less utility or satisfaction from an additional dollar. This is because the extra wealth is more likely to be spent on luxury items than basic necessities, which typically provide a lower level of marginal satisfaction or utility. David's existing wealth already provides him with a comfortable life, so any additional wealth generates less incremental utility. In line with the utilitarian principle mentioned in the hint, economic inequality is problematic because wealth distribution that prioritizes the few over the many does not maximize the overall utility or happiness of society. A more equal distribution of wealth, as seen in Finland with John and Keith, leads to higher aggregate utility as additional wealth in the hands of those with fewer resources generates more marginal utility than when the same wealth is with the very rich. Several studies have supported this theory by demonstrating that societies with lower levels of inequality exhibit higher population-wide satisfaction and happiness. Consequently, it can be concluded that Greg, being the poorer individual in Russia, would have a larger marginal utility than David, who is already wealthy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

George Edward Foreman (born January 10, 1949) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1969 to 1977, and from 1987 to 1997. Nicknamed \\"Big George\\", he is a two-time world heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist. Outside the sport he is an ordained minister, author, and entrepreneur. After a troubled childhood Foreman took up amateur boxing and won a gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1968 Summer Olympics. In 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38. In his autobiography, he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created, which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career. Another stated ambition was to fight Mike Tyson. For his first fight, he went to Sacramento, California, where he beat journeyman Steve Zouski by a knockout in four rounds. Foreman weighed 267 lb (121 kg) for the fight and looked badly out of shape. Although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake, Foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals (as he said later, he wanted to show that age 40 is not a \\"death sentence\\"). He won four more bouts that year, gradually slimming down and improving his fitness. In 1988, he won nine times. Perhaps his most notable win during this period was a seventh-round knockout of former Light Heavyweight and Cruiserweight Champion Dwight Muhammad Qawi.  Having always been a deliberate fighter, Foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first \\"retirement\\", although he found it harder to keep his balance after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations. He was still capable of landing heavy single blows, however. The late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man now seemed to be unexpectedly gone, and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds. Foreman attributed this to his new, relaxed fighting style (he has spoken of how, earlier in his career, his lack of stamina came from an enormous amount of nervous tension).  By 1989, while continuing his comeback, Foreman had sold his name and face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from grills to mufflers on TV. For this purpose his public persona was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman had been replaced by a smiling, friendly George. He and Ali had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside the boundaries of boxing.  Foreman continued his string of victories, winning five more fights, the most impressive being a three-round win over Bert Cooper, who went on to contest the Undisputed Heavyweight title against Evander Holyfield. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did Foreman fight for the championship in his second comeback?","output":"Yes, Foreman fought for the championship in his second comeback.

By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between - essentially Petén and much of Belize - independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated. Answer this question: How many years after Columbus discovered the Americas did Cortés set sail?","output":"Hernán Cortés set sail to explore the Mexican coast in 1519. Given that Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas in 1492, this means it was 27 years after Columbus' discovery that Cortés embarked on his journey. This time period was characterized by many expeditions across the New World as part of the Age of Discovery, as European powers sought to expand their territories, gain wealth, and spread Christianity. In Spain's case, private adventurers entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown, agreeing to conquer and rule the newly discovered lands in return for a part of the tax revenues. The ensuing age of exploration and colonization profoundly altered the course of world history, leading to an increased global interconnectedness, while at the same time exposing indigenous cultures to devastating diseases, warfare, and subjugation under colonial rule. These historical events, including the voyages of Columbus and Cortés, are remembered with a mix of admiration for their daring exploration and criticism for the immense suffering caused to the native populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Stir the sifted flour and salt together thoroughly, preferably in a sizable heat-resistant mixing bowl. Because maintaining a cool temperature is essential to keeping the gluten strands from forming a strong bond, using chilled flour and a chilled bowl is recommended. While you're preparing the dough, it's a good idea to chill your butter thoroughly before you attempt to work it in, if you're using butter. Anytime the mixture gets overworked, you can stop, put the mixing bowl into the fridge, and let it chill back down to a workable temperature. There are many different methods of cutting the fat into the flour, but all are equally effective with the right amount of elbow grease. The most important thing is to keep the butter cool, if you use it, so keep it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes or so, cutting it into large chunks before integrating it more thoroughly. You want to mix in the fat until you have small and uniform pea-sized chunks.   Use a food processor. The easiest way to cut the butter is to use a food processor, pulsing the flour mixture for a minute or two, until the butter is chopped up to the appropriate size.  Use a pastry cutter for butter or shortening. A pastry cutter is a great way of chopping up the butter in a good uniform mixture, quickly and without much effort. Roll the pastry cutter through the flour mixture, clearing out the butter from behind the tines after you make each pass around the bowl, if necessary. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes.  Use a fork or two knives. If you don't have a pastry cutter or a food processor, don't fret. It's possible, but takes slightly more hand strength and effort, to cut up the butter with the flat side of a table fork, using two knives to slice the butter in opposite directions, or even just using the end of a metal spatula.  Just use your fingers with shortening. Shortening won't be greatly affected by the heat from your hands or from the room temperature, making it easy to get your hands in and crumble up the shortening into the flour using your fingers. You can also do this with butter. Letting it get warm makes the mixture too glutenous and it won't be flakey. Use a wooden spoon and gently stir the flour as you pour a small amount of ice water into the bowl. Pour a tablespoon or two at a time, integrating it gently by agitating the flour. The mixture should just barely come together and form a loose ball, and shouldn't be at all damp or wet looking. Be very gentle. The key to a flaky crust is to make sure you don't overwork the dough. Pie crust is not bread dough, and if you overwork the dough, the crust will become quite tough and difficult to handle.  Be a minimalist when it comes to mixing the water into the flour. Less touching means more tender dough. If you're struggling to get the flour to come together, or if everything has become too warm, don't be afraid to pop the bowl into the freezer for a couple of minutes to chill it back down to a more workable temperature. Cold dough is easier to work with. Very gently, pull the flour into a ball, touching it as little as possible, and then split ball in two equal portions. The recipe should make two portions, which you could use for one bottom crust and one top crust, or bottom crusts for two different pies. Cut the dough ball in half with a kitchen knife and separate the halves gently.  It's usually a good idea to chill the dough in the refrigerator until you're ready to roll it out and bake with it. If you've already got the oven pre-heated and you're anxious to get started, putting it in the freezer can be a good way to get the temperature down quickly. If you want to save the dough for a longer period of time, freeze it in a self-sealing freezer bag. When you're ready to use it, let it defrost in the fridge overnight and roll it out normally.","output":"The article provides detailed steps and tips on how to prepare a flaky pie crust by maintaining cool temperatures, using the right tools to mix the ingredients, and handling the dough gently to avoid overworking it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The surgeon who had delivered my son by C-section an hour earlier stepping back from the table, and saying, “We're done, people. Good job, everyone!” That hour had been hell for everyone in the room, save only my little boy, sleeping peacefully in the warming crib, and his mother, who was just stirring from the general that had put her under about 55 minutes earlier. I had come within a few minutes, maybe seconds, of raising my boy as a single parent. Her OB/GYN had fought valliently to keep my family together, and won. Everyone who'd been awake knew exactly how close run a thing it had been. Mr. Murphy had been hanging around the whole time, and neither Doc nor mom was catching a whole lot of breaks that evening. But Doc only needed one, and he made full use thereof. One thing for all new dad's whose wives have had previous abdominal surgery. You never want to hear the muttered words, “Creative anatomy on the way out”, when somebody has your wife’s belly open. Those are about the worst words in the world, because they mean Doc's gotta put stuff to right in there, and he might not have what he'd like in order to get it done. But when he stands back, after the sponge count had to be done twice, and the tool count is right, and the belly is stapled closed, and everyone in the room is still breathing… Just let it be known that the roving nurse has extra sponges for dad's nose. Oh yeah, and the neonatal nurses don't expect dad to change that first diaper. Maconium is nasty shit. Litterally. But I was happy to do it while talking to his groggy mom.

The question you've asked is about the number of cubes in the United States, while the answer given is related to destination marketing organizations, which is a completely unrelated topic. To provide a more relevant answer, it is important to clarify what is meant by \\"cubes\\" in the context of the question.  1. If the question refers to cubic measurements of space, then it would be impossible to accurately estimate the number of \\"cubes\\" in the United States, as these figures would vary depending on the units used to measure volume (e.g., cubic inches, cubic feet, or cubic meters) and whether the cubes encompass empty spaces, buildings, natural land features, etc. 2. If the context refers to physical objects in the shape of a cube (e.g., ice cubes, toy cubes, or gaming dice), it would likewise be challenging to provide an accurate estimate, as the number of such objects would depend on factors such as manufacturing, consumer demand, and inventories. Moreover, these figures would constantly change due to daily activity and fluctuations in the market. 3. If \\"cubes\\" pertain to a specific company or product, like Rubik's cubes, one would need to research the number of such items sold in the United States, including both authentic Rubik's cubes and other similar products. However, even this information may be difficult to determine exactly due to variations in sales and the presence of counterfeit goods on the market.

When we knew it might be his last birthday, the whole family decided to get together for a huge birthday celebration at the nursing home. Dad was a good storyteller and we were always his listeners. During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes. Everyone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many hundreds of people in his life, here was our chance to tell him how much we love him. A few months later, at Dad's memorial service, we more fully realized what we had given to Dad that night. Those are the stories people normally tell at a funeral   after a loved one is no longer alive to hear the words. They tell stories, full of tears. But we had given those memories to Dad in his life, and we had told them through laughter, together with hugs and joy. He had them to hold and enjoyed them from time to time in his mind during his last days and months. Words do matter, and they are enough.

Chris Christie  said Tuesday that New Jersey needed \\"tough and plain-spoken leadership\\" when  he  took office eight years ago and  he  delivered it  pulling the state from \\"the brink of financial ruin\\" by confronting problems leaders of both parties had ignored for decades.  Christie  hands over state government to Democrat Phil Murphy in a week.  Christie  said  he  was the first governor in America to try to tackle the huge and escalating burden of state pension costs  saying previous governors from both parties and Legislatures \\"virtually ignored the growing menace of increased costs and no real contributions.\\" Among the steps taken during  his  administration was dedicating lottery proceeds to the pension system for the next 30 years. When  he  took office   Christie  said  New Jersey was \\"on the brink of financial ruin as a state.\\" \\"We needed tough and plain-spoken leadership to deal with these problems \\"  he  said.  He  said  he  vetoed more than 7 billion in spending  helped cut the state workforce  pushed through a cap on property tax increases and  at the same time  made sure the state invested heavily to help protect the New Jersey Shore from the kind of devastation it suffered during Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The prepared text of  his  remarks didn't show  him  invoking the name of  his  friend  President Donald Trump. But  he  called it an \\"honor\\" to chair the White House's opioid commission.  Christie 's speech caps  his  stint as one of America's best-known governors.  He  was on the cover of Time magazine under the headline \\"The Boss\\" and a periodic guest on late-night television  where  he  memorably appeared in a skit about \\"dad dancing\\" with Jimmy Fallon and poked fun at  his  weight by eating a doughnut on David Letterman's show. At least in the beginning   he  won acclaim for  his  forthrightness  like when  he  told beachcombers to \\"get the hell off the beach\\" in 2011 during Hurricane Irene.  He  told it like it was before Trump brought the practice to the White House.  He  also was exceedingly popular and widely praised for guiding the state in its recovery from Superstorm Sandy  which ravaged the coastline.  He  was briefly seen as a top GOP contender for president. But  he  was also criticized for testy exchanges with the public during town hall meetings and other encounters.  His  popularity and job approval fell sharply  particularly after the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal in which three of  his  allies were convicted in a political retribution scheme.  He  also lost the home crowd after spending much of 2015 and early 2016 campaigning for president out of state  a contest  he  dropped out of after failing to emerge from the back of the pack.  He  returned to New Jersey and focused on the state's â and country's â opioid addiction crisis after failing to get a top job in the Trump administration. A regular theme in  his  remarks around the state included \\"second chances \\" and the idea that people can make a comeback. Output:","output":"Part 1: Generate a short title of the document.

There are numerous reasons to consider this as the most probable outcome, such as: 1. Sabok's death resulted from choking on medication without anyone attempting to save him, which suggests negligence on the part of the hospital and its staff. This could potentially form the basis for a medical malpractice or wrongful death lawsuit against the hospital. 2. The involvement of federal investigators and the discovery of multiple cases of suspected abuse and neglect, including physical violence caught on video, further damages the hospital's reputation and could strengthen the family's legal case. This also signifies that there might be systemic issues within the hospital that contributed to Sabok's death. 3. The hospital's loss of certification and Medicare funding – estimated at 800,000 a month – not only impacts its financial standing but also potentially tarnishes its credibility. This fact might be viewed as additional evidence of a dysfunctional institution, potentially increasing the chances of a successful lawsuit. 4. The traumatic experience of losing a family member, compounded by the hospital's multiple alleged issues, would likely result in the family seeking justice for Sabok through the legal system. While option [i] may happen in the long run, initiating a lawsuit could be a crucial step for the family in their healing process. It is important to note that the family's future actions may also include a combination of the possibilities listed.

Background: Herbert Alexander Simon (June 15, 1916 - February 9, 2001) was an American economist and political scientist whose primary interest was decision-making within organizations and is best known for the theories of \\"bounded rationality\\" and \\"satisficing\\". He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 and the Turing Award in 1975. His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science, computer science, public administration, management, and political science. He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career, from 1949 to 2001. Context: Herbert Alexander Simon was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on June 15, 1916. His father, Arthur Simon (1881-1948), was an electrical engineer who had come to the United States from Germany in 1903 after earning his engineering degree from the Technische Hochschule of Darmstadt. An inventor who was granted \\"several dozen patents\\", his father also was an independent patent attorney. His mother, Edna Marguerite Merkel, was an accomplished pianist whose ancestors had come from Prague and Cologne. His European ancestors had been piano makers, goldsmiths, and vintners. Simon's father was Jewish and his mother came from a family with Jewish, Lutheran, and Catholic backgrounds. Simon called himself an atheist.  Simon was educated in the Milwaukee public school system, where he developed an interest in science. He found schoolwork to be interesting and easy. Unlike many children, Simon was exposed to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically at a relatively young age due to the influence of his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel, who had studied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under John R. Commons. Through his uncle's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered the social sciences. Among his earliest influences, Simon has cited Richard Ely's economics textbook, Norman Angell's The Great Illusion, and Henry George's Progress and Poverty. At that time, Simon argued \\"from conviction, rather than cussedness\\" in favor of George's controversial \\"single tax\\" on land rents.  In 1933, Simon entered the University of Chicago, and following those early influences, he studied the social sciences and mathematics. He was interested in biology, but chose not to study it because of his \\"color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory\\". He chose instead to focus on political science and economics. His most important mentor was Henry Schultz, an econometrician and mathematical economist. Simon received both his B.A. (1936) and his Ph.D. (1943) in political science, from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Harold Lasswell, Nicholas Rashevsky, Rudolf Carnap, Henry Schultz, and Charles Edward Merriam.  After enrolling in a course on \\"Measuring Municipal Governments\\", Simon was invited to be a research assistant for Clarence Ridley, with whom he coauthored Measuring Municipal Activities in 1938. Eventually his studies led him to the field of organizational decision-making, which would become the subject of his doctoral dissertation. Question: what followed this ? Answer:","output":"After completing his doctoral dissertation, Herbert Simon embarked on a fruitful academic and research career that spanned across various disciplines. His work on organizational decision-making paved the way for his future contributions to diverse fields such as economics, political science, computer science, psychology, and management. In 1942, Simon accepted a position as a political science professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Here, he worked closely with mathematician and philosopher Rudolf Carnap, who influenced Simon's interest in logical positivism and scientific approaches to understanding human behavior. During World War II, Simon worked with the Office of Price Administration, using his expertise in mathematical modeling and statistics to address wartime economic challenges. This experience had a significant impact on his subsequent research. In 1949, Simon joined the Carnegie Mellon University (previously known as the Carnegie Institute of Technology) as a professor of administration and psychology. The multidisciplinary environment at Carnegie Mellon suited Simon's diverse interests, and he remained there for the rest of his career. At Carnegie Mellon, Simon started working on his groundbreaking theory of \\"bounded rationality.\\" He argued that individuals or organizations make decisions based on information and cognitive capacity limitations, which prevents optimal decision-making and leads to the selection of a \\"satisficing\\" alternative that meets the minimum requirements. This idea revolutionized the field of decision-making and economics by acknowledging the cognitive limitations and imperfect information environment faced by real-world decision-makers. In the early 1950s, Simon began working with Allen Newell, a computer scientist, and their collaboration marked the beginning of a long-lasting partnership between the two scholars. This partnership had significant implications for the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI) and led to the development of the \\"Logic Theorist,\\" the first AI program, in 1956. Simon's research continued to expand into various fields. He worked on information processing theories that helped push the boundaries of computer science and laid the groundwork for the study of problem-solving, cognitive psychology, and human reasoning. He also made significant contributions to public administration and management. In addition to his Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978, Simon received numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including the Turing Award in 1975, which marked the pinnacle of his achievements in computer science. He authored multiple books and published a vast number of articles, shaping the academic landscape across multiple disciplines and leaving a lasting legacy. Herbert Simon continued to remain actively involved in research and teaching at Carnegie Mellon University until his death on February 9, 2001. His life's work represents a rare synthesis of interdisciplinary research, and his contributions have had far-reaching effects on a variety of fields, from economics and political science to computer science and artificial intelligence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who was last seen at an archaeological dig?, using the article: Two young American couples — Jeff and Amy, and Eric and Stacy — enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias, a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins. At the top, they find an abandoned camp and a shaft in the center. The group cannot call for help since Eric's phone has no signal. They hear a cell phone ringing from somewhere inside the ruins. Believing it is Heinrich's phone ringing, the rest of the group lowers Mathias down the shaft with a rope. The rope breaks and Mathias falls, becoming completely paralyzed. Amy and Jeff descend the temple steps hoping to reason with the Mayans, but to no success. In anger, Amy throws a clump of vines at them and hits a young boy, whom the Mayans promptly kill. They realize the Mayans are afraid of the vines, and won't let them go since they have touched them. Later, Stacy and Amy descend the shaft to help Mathias and to find the phone.

He was born on July 13 and made his Test debut in 1908 on the same day. Alderwick was a right-handed batsman, and his primary role in the team was as a bowler. However, the details of his bowling style remain unknown. Alderwick represented England at the international level, playing his first and last Test match in 1908. His Test debut and Test career came to an end within a short span, from July 13 to July 16, 1908. Throughout his short international career, he played only two first-class matches. In these two matches, he scored a total of 7 runs as a batsman. Unfortunately, Alderwick did not claim any wickets as a bowler during his career. He also did not achieve any significant milestones such as five-wicket hauls (fivefor) or ten-wicket hauls (tenfor) in a match.  Additionally, his catching and stumpings record remains unknown, but he was a part of a single column, which suggests he might have been a specialist in a specific field position or role in the team.

Which fork would have lower frequency of the vibrations, fork A or fork B?  John was tuning his musical instruments with two tuning forks, fork A and fork B. He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude.  Hint: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude.

Meaning of It? \\"What is the meaning of 'beagleize it'?\\" Pick your answer from: --no --yes","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. Let me provide a more detailed explanation for each of them. 1. Meaning of It? This question is quite ambiguous, as it simply asks for the meaning of \\"it.\\" Without any context, the question cannot be answered accurately. \\"It\\" is a pronoun commonly used in English to refer to something previously mentioned or something that is easily identified in some way. Examples of usage include \\"It is hot outside\\" or \\"I love that book, and it is my favorite.\\" In these examples, \\"it\\" refers to the weather and the book. However, in a standalone question without context, the intended object remains unclear. 2. \\"What is the meaning of 'beagleize it'?\\" This question is more specific and focused, as it asks for the meaning of the term \\"beagleize it.\\" Beagleize is not a standard English word, and its meaning may vary depending on context or where it is used. It may be derived from the word \\"beagle,\\" which refers to a breed of small hounds or dogs with specific physical and behavioral traits. As a verb, \\"beagleize\\" could mean to make something or someone be like a beagle, or to apply beagle-like characteristics or qualities to something. \\"Beagleize it\\" would then mean an instruction or request to apply these characteristics or qualities to an mentioned object or situation. However, without any context or usage, it is difficult to determine the exact intended meaning of the term.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the first name of Sir Terence Aubrey Murray's wife? from the following article ?  The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Write an article based on this \\"National League side Aldershot Town have signed Millwall striker Alfie Pavey on a 28-day youth loan deal.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Millwall Striker Alfie Pavey Joins Aldershot Town on 28-day Youth Loan Deal In a significant development for Aldershot Town FC, the National League side has announced the signing of Millwall forward Alfie Pavey on a 28-day youth loan deal. With this acquisition, the Shots are expected to bolster their attacking options, as they continue their campaign in England's fifth tier of football. A product of the Millwall Academy, Alfie Pavey, 22, has been considered one of the rising talents in English football. Standing at 6ft 2in, the striker possesses a strong aerial presence, remarkable finishing skills and an impressive work rate, which should ideally suit the playing style of Aldershot Town manager Danny Searle. Having spent his early career representing various age groups for Millwall, Pavey first came into the limelight in the 2014/15 season, when he scored 19 goals for the Under-18 team. His impressive performances caught the attention of the club's first team, and he was soon handed a professional contract in 2015. Since then, he has made sporadic appearances for the Lions, while gaining valuable experience during loan spells at various Football League and National League clubs, including Bromley, Dartford, Greenwich Borough, Hampton & Richmond Borough, and most recently, Havant & Waterlooville. Despite having limited opportunities at the Den, Pavey exhibited his goal-scoring prowess during his time with Dartford and Hampton & Richmond, where he found the back of the net regularly. In January 2020, Pavey joined National League side Havant & Waterlooville on loan, earning high praise for his performances, which included eight goals in 13 appearances before the season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision to sign Pavey on a youth loan deal aligns with Aldershot's approach of investing in young talents and integrating them into their first team. The Shots are currently in need of a goal-scorer up front, as they have struggled to find the net consistently this season. Thus, a player of Pavey's physicality and aggression could be the much-needed catalyst for a turnaround in their fortunes. Aldershot Town boss Danny Searle expressed his delight in welcoming Pavey to the team and shared his expectations for the young striker: \\"Alfie is a proven goal-scorer for his age group and has all the attributes we look for in a striker. We are confident that he will improve the team's goal-scoring abilities and provide a boost to our frontline.\\" For the young forward, this move presents an opportunity to showcase his skills on a consistent basis and attract the attention of his parent club, Millwall, who would ideally be looking for him to gain more first-team experience. A stellar performance with Aldershot Town could potentially help Pavey earn a more prominent role within Millwall's future plans or open up avenues for him to pursue his career elsewhere. In conclusion, the signing of Alfie Pavey appears to be a strategically sound decision by Aldershot Town, as the English striker brings a wealth of experience from various loan spells while promising to impact their attacking set-up. As the Shots continue searching for a return to the Football League, the addition of talented, young players like Pavey could prove to be invaluable for the team's fortunes. Only time will tell if the Millwall striker can engineer a turnaround at the National League side, but this transfer certainly exhibits the potential for mutual success."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

When we sleep, our body can focus more of its resources on repairing damaged tissues, fighting infections, and boosting our immune system. Positions like lying down or elevating an affected limb can also facilitate improved blood circulation, which is essential for delivering oxygen and nutrients to the damaged areas.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. \\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \\"It is unique. Forbidden fruit.\\" Collectors' Web sites have surged with speculation about the sale price, and enthusiasts even organized betting pools.  Question: \\"What is the history of the double eagle?\\" Answer: \\"Minted in 1804\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, the answer provided is incorrect. The history of the double eagle mentioned here specifically refers to the 1933 double eagle coin, not the 1804 coin. The 1933 double eagle coin bears a fascinating history involving presidents, kings, and a Secret Service sting operation. This 20 gold piece is a potent symbol of one of the United States' past economic crises caused by the Great Depression. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt banned the possession of gold coins in a bid to tackle the worsening economic conditions. He ordered the Treasury to melt down any of these coins that were not recovered, making the 1933 double eagle increasingly rare. Although up to 445,500 double eagles were struck in 1933, most of them never circulated. A few, however, managed to escape the melting pot, with their numbers dwindling to under 20 known examples. A legendary episode in the double eagle's story involves a king, specifically King Farouk of Egypt, who legally exported one of the coins from the US in 1944. The coin was later sold at auction in 1954 after Farouk was deposed. Another twist in the coin's history occurred when a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, was arrested for attempting to sell a 1933 double eagle at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. This led to a court battle, where Fenton eventually won the right to split the auction proceeds with the US Mint. With so few of these rare gold coins in existence, the 1933 double eagle has attracted considerable attention from coin collectors, resulting in record-breaking auction prices and solidifying its place in numismatic history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Passage: As a result of the 2008 Russian military reforms, the units of the Russian Naval Aviation were reorganized into 13 new Naval Air Bases. Each new naval air base consists of an HQ, support units and one or more aviation groups/wings . In a second stage, the air bases were merged into territorially integrated structures. Only the 279th Regiment retained its status. The planned transfer of Naval Aviation assets  to the Air Force has been delayed  due to their importance to the service, but was finally implemented by the end of 2011. As of 2012, the only fixed wing strike and fighter aircraft of Russian Naval Aviation are the Su-33 fighters and Su-25UTG attack aircraft of the 279th Regiment , plus the Su-24 bombers based in the Crimea. This sole bomber unit remained part of Naval Aviation as an exception to satisfy treaty requirements governing Russian forces deployments on Ukrainian territory . Buying  brand new multirole Sukhoi Su-30SM for the Black Sea Fleet to replace Su-24 was in the planning stages and it has been completed as of December 2016. Naval aviation also retains the anti-submarine aircraft of the forces  and the helicopter arm.

Write an article based on this summary: – Dairy Queen has given the boot to one of its franchisees after he allegedly unleashed a racist tirade against a customer. Deianeira Ford visited a Zion, Ill., DQ on Wednesday with her two young children and asked for a refund after her order was mixed up. Owner James Crichton gave her one, though she says he also started yelling at her. \\"He called me and my children n------,\\" Ford tells the Washington Post. \\"He said I can go back to where I came from.\\" She called 911 and the responding officer spoke to Crichton, who, per the police report, \\"proudly admitted to calling Ford a n-----\\" and ranted about his other black customers. But since he hadn't committed a crime, there was nothing police could do. It ended up being Ford's own Facebook post that resulted in big consequences for Crichton. Her post about the incident went viral, and on Saturday, dozens of demonstrators gathered—initially, they planned to protest the store and call for a boycott, the Lake County News-Sun reports. Instead, the gathering was a celebration, because on Friday Dairy Queen announced it was shutting down the location and terminating Crichton's franchise rights. DQ called Crichton's actions \\"inexcusable, reprehensible, and unacceptable,\\" and Crichton himself apologized via a DQ statement. (Crichton had previously told the News-Sun Ford's story was \\"99% lies.\\") Ford's attorney tells the Post that legal action may still be taken against Dairy Queen, because since Ford came forward, other customers and employees of that location have shared similar stories. (A shopper's tirade got her banned from JCPenney.) Article:","output":"Title: Dairy Queen Severs Ties with Franchisee following Racist Outburst Dairy Queen, the popular quick-serve restaurant chain, has formally terminated its agreement with one of its franchisees, James Crichton, following allegations of a racial tirade against a customer. This dramatic decision came after Crichton reportedly engaged in a racial rant at his Dairy Queen outlet in Zion, Ill., when a customer requested a refund due to a mix-up in her order. The customer, Deianeira Ford, visited the Dairy Queen branch with her two young children last Wednesday. According to her, not only did the franchise owner give her a refund, but he also allegedly shouted racial slurs at her and her children. Ford stated in an interview with the Washington Post, \\"He called me and my children n------ and said I can go back to where I came from.\\"  Reacting to the incident, Ford called 911, which led to a law enforcement officer interacting with Crichton. As per the police report, Crichton \\"proudly admitted to calling Ford a n-----\\" and went on to vent about his other African-American customers. However, as no crimes had been committed in the eyes of the law, the police were unable to take punitive action. Ironically, it was Ford's recounting of the incident on Facebook that prompted the larger repercussions for Crichton. Her post quickly went viral, leading to dozens of people organizing a protest against the Dairy Queen location, even contemplating a boycott, according to reports from the Lake County News-Sun.  However, in turn of the events, the protest transformed into a celebration. This happened after Dairy Queen made the announcement on Friday that it was closing down the franchise and effectively terminating Crichton's franchise rights. The company publicly denounced Crichton's actions, declaring them \\"inexcusable, reprehensible, and unacceptable\\". Additionally, Crichton extended an apology via a Dairy Queen statement, which was somewhat undermined by a previous statement to the News-Sun where he claimed Ford's story was \\"99% lies.\\" Although Dairy Queen has taken action, the story doesn’t end there. Ford's attorney has mentioned that they may still pursue legal action against the corporation. This is due to other customers and employees of the subject Dairy Queen franchise coming forward with similar stories of racially motivated experiences following Ford's disclosure. Despite the unfortunate incident, Dairy Queen's swift response underscores a powerful message about intolerance for racism in business establishments, sending a clear signal to other businesses about the potential repercussions of such malicious actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: One of the greatest sources of unhappiness, in my experience, is the difficulty we have in accepting things as they are. When we see something we don't like, we wish it could be different. We cry out for something better. That may be human nature,or perhaps it's something ingrained  in our culture. The root of the unhappiness isn't necessarily that we want things to be different.However, it's that we decided we didn't like it in the first place. We've judged it as bad,rather than saying, \\"It's not bad or good, and it just is it.\\" In one of my books, I said, \\"You should expect people to mess up and expect things to go differently than you planned\\". Some readers said it's too sorrowful to expect things to go wrong.However, it's only negative if you see it as negative and judge it as bad. Instead,you could accept it as the way the world works and try to understand why that is. This can be applied to whatever you do:how other people act at work,how politics works and how depressing the news media can be.Accept these things as they are,and try to understand why they're that way.  _  will save you a lot of sadness,because you'll no longer say, \\"Oh, I wish bad things didn't happen!'' Does it mean you can never change things? Not at all. But change things not because you can't accept things as they are, but because you enjoy the process of changing, learning and growing. Can we make this world a better place? You can say that you'll continue to try to do things to help others, to grow as a person, to make a difference in this world. That's the correct path you choose to take,because you enjoy that path. Therefore, when you find yourself judging and wishing for difference, try a different approach: accept, and understand.

Beulah Print and Design, based in Drogheda, County Louth, confirmed it had declined an order from Jonathon Brennan, one of their former customers. The company said its staff were \\"Bible-believing Christians\\" who did not support same-sex marriage. Mr Brennan told the Irish Independent he was \\"infuriated and shocked\\". The 29-year-old businessman, who owns a salon in Drogheda, is due to enter a civil partnership with his boyfriend of eight years, John Kierans, in August. He told the newspaper he had been a customer of the printing company for four years, before it refused to accept his order. Mr Brennan said the firm's co-owner, Noel Tuite, initially agreed to print the invitations, but visited Mr Brennan's salon on Wednesday to explain the order would be declined. Another co-founder of the firm, Mike O'Leary, told the BBC that although he accepted that there are people who practise homosexuality, he did not hold a \\"morally neutral\\" attitude towards it. Mr O'Leary said that as a Christian he did not agree with a gay \\"agenda or lifestyle\\", and objected to same-sex marriage. He added he was aware in passing of a similar case in Northern Ireland last year, when a Christian-owned bakery firm refused to bake a cake with a logo supporting gay marriage. He said he agreed with Ashers Baking Company's decision to decline the cake order. It was not the first time Beulah Print and Design has refused orders on the grounds of their religious beliefs. Mr O'Leary said that 10 years ago, they declined a similar request to print invitations for a gay ceremony abroad. He added they have also refused request to print materials that promote binge drinking, Halloween, \\"borderline pornography\\" and what he described as \\"the dark arts\\". Mr O'Leary co-founded the firm 12 years ago, after meeting Mr Tuite through Christian fellowship meetings in Drogheda. Members of three families are now employed at the printing company. In a statement, the firm said: \\"We, at Beulah Print, are Bible-believing Christians who are committed to standing by our conscience and God's Word. \\"We have been in business for 12 years during which time we have held to our convictions and have at times declined a variety of work which we felt was clearly contrary to our beliefs. \\"We have never hidden our faith from our customers and represent the gospel at every opportunity.

Answer the following question: What kept the narrator from riding horses more ?","output":"The narrator mentions that they had envisioned riding horses a significantly greater number of times than they ended up doing, indicating that there must have been some sort of obstacle or hindrance preventing them from doing so. The primary factor that seems to have kept the narrator from riding horses more during the summer appears to be their weight. The narrator expresses hope that by next year they will have their weight down again, which suggests that they might currently be struggling with weight-related issues. This could include being overweight, having health issues tied to weight, or perhaps just lacking physical fitness. Being overweight or lacking physical fitness can make it difficult to ride horses comfortably, safely, and effectively. Riding a horse puts stress on the body, particularly on the joints and muscles, and requires a certain level of balance, coordination, and stamina. If a person isn't physically fit or is overweight, they may find it challenging to ride for long periods or even to mount and dismount the horse. Moreover, the person's weight may also cause discomfort or strain to the horse, making it harder for the animal to perform to the best of its abilities. Other factors that may have kept the narrator from riding more could include a lack of time, financial limitations, or scheduling conflicts. It's important to note, though, that from the information provided in the text, the narrator's focus is on their weight as the primary cause for having ridden less than they had originally planned.

Question: \\"What is being classified?\\"  Context: \\"In 1925, 78.26 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered synchronous turntable motor. This motor ran at 3600 rpm, such that a 46:1 gear ratio would produce 78.26 rpm. In parts of the world that used 50 Hz current, the standard was 77.92 rpm (3,000 rpm with a 77:2 ratio), which was also the speed at which a strobe disc with 77 lines would \\"stand still\\" in 50 Hz light (92 lines for 60 Hz).

The World Bank has also been criticized for its role in financing projects that have been detrimental to human rights and the natural environment. Q with options: Can we draw the following conclusion? The World Bank is criticized for its activities. Options are: (A). yes. (B). no.","output":"(A) Yes, we can draw the conclusion that The World Bank is criticized for its activities. The World Bank's primary goal is to reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity by providing financial and technical assistance to developing countries. However, despite its positive intentions, the organization has faced criticism over the years for its role in financing projects that have had negative impacts on human rights and the natural environment. One main criticism stems from the institution's support of large-scale infrastructure projects such as dams, power plants, and transportation networks. These projects often have significant environmental consequences, including deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and pollution of water resources. In some cases, they have also led to the displacement of local communities and indigenous peoples, violating their land rights and causing social unrest. Another aspect critics point toward is the World Bank's policy prescription for developing countries, particularly in relation to economic liberalization, privatization, and austerity measures. These policies, often termed as 'structural adjustment programs' or 'Washington Consensus,' have sometimes resulted in short-term economic benefits but long-term social and economic problems for the local populations. Austerity measures, for example, have led to cuts in social services, exacerbating poverty and inequality. Furthermore, the World Bank's governance structure has also been a target of criticism. The organization is mainly led by developed countries, which are the principal contributors to its budget and hold significant decision-making power. Critics argue that this structure gives an unfair advantage to wealthy nations, allowing them to impose their policy preferences and economic interests on developing countries. In the past, the World Bank has been accused of acting as an instrument of Western political and economic domination. In response to these criticisms, the World Bank has made efforts to improve its practices and policies and become more transparent, inclusive, and environmentally and socially responsible. The organization has introduced safeguards to better assess the environmental and social risks of the projects it finances, established grievance mechanisms for affected communities, and increased consultation and collaboration with local stakeholders. Nevertheless, the conclusion that the World Bank is criticized for its activities is indeed valid, considering the various critiques mentioned above. While the institution has achieved significant progress in addressing some of these concerns, it continues to be scrutinized and held accountable to ensure its actions align with its core mission of reducing poverty and fostering inclusive, sustainable development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bermuda In May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return. In September 1940, as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell's Island in 1943). Q: What did the US ask of Britain in May 1940?","output":"In May 1940, the United States asked Britain for base rights in Bermuda. This request came in the context of the early stages of World War II, when establishing strategic military locations was of great importance for ensuring the safety and efficiency of military operations. However, at that time, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to grant the United States the base rights in Bermuda, as he sought something in return for this significant concession.  The negotiations between the United States and the United Kingdom eventually led to the Destroyers for Bases Agreement in September 1940, an important deal that allowed the United States to have base rights in several British territories. Although Bermuda and Newfoundland were not initially included in the agreement, both territories were later added to it, without the United Kingdom receiving any war material in return. As part of the agreement, the United States built an airfield in Bermuda that was to be jointly used by both the US and the UK. This arrangement stood for the duration of the war, with the Royal Air Force (RAF) Transport Command relocating to the Bermuda airfield from Darrell's Island in 1943. Thus, the United States' request for base rights in Bermuda during May 1940 eventually resulted in a mutually beneficial arrangement between the two wartime allies, as they collaborated in their military operations against the Axis powers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Violation of these laws rights enables corrupt countries to gain illegitimate economic advantage in the international market.\\", we find that untrustworthy leaders hold on to their immoral behavior primarily due to the economic advantage they gain through corruption in their respective countries. These leaders are able to manipulate and exploit laws and regulations related to the environment, worker protection, and labor rights – including unionization and child labor – by bribing officials and using other corrupt practices. Consequently, this allows them to maintain power and control over resources, while at the same time providing an unfair competitive advantage in the international market. As a result, it becomes quite clear that these untrustworthy leaders prioritize their personal or political gains over the welfare of their people, as well as the environment, leading to further deteriorating conditions in terms of both social rights and environmental sustainability. In short, some untrustworthy leaders continue to engage in immoral behavior simply because of the corrupt environment in which they operate, allowing them to benefit economically and maintain their hold on power.

I read this background article the other day: Biodiversity's relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue, as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss. This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health. Partly, the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources. While the distribution of clean water increases, in some parts of the world it remains unequal. According to the World Health Organisation (2018) only 71% of the global population used a safely managed drinking-water service.Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security, infectious disease, medical science and medicinal resources, social and psychological health. Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts.Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market...  I am facing a new situation today: Belgium and France are two countries participating at a human health meeting. Belgium has a lower biodiversity, while France's biodiversity is much higher.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country didn't cause the scarcity of fresh water? A:","output":"Belgium B: France  Since the question does not provide specific information regarding water scarcity in either Belgium or France, a direct answer cannot be given based on the task assigned. However, in referring to the context given from your background article, it talks about how biodiversity loss can be linked to several health issues including the scarcity of fresh water.  In this case, it's suggested that countries with higher biodiversity, like France in your new situation, would have a better chance at avoiding the scarcity of fresh water due to the diversified ecosystem services, including better water regulation, than those countries with lower biodiversity, like Belgium in your situation.   So, taking the context from your background article, and applying it to your new situation, one could infer that France, having a higher biodiversity, did not cause the scarcity of water. This is only an assumption based on the correlation between biodiversity and water resources as implied by your background article and might not hold if specific data on water management of each country were provided. Please remember that this is a presumption, and the actual situation could defer based on varied factors like efficiency of water management, population demand, industrial use and others in each specific country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based in the Electorate of Brandenburg, the main branch of the Hohenzollern intermarried with the branch ruling the Duchy of Prussia, and secured succession upon the latter's extinction in the male line in 1618. Another consequence of the intermarriage was the incorporation of the lower Rhenish principalities of Cleves, Mark and Ravensberg after the Treaty of Xanten in 1614. The Thirty Years' War (161848) was especially devastating. The Elector changed sides three times, and as a result Protestant and Catholic armies swept the land back and forth, killing, burning, seizing men and taking the food supplies. Upwards of half the population was killed or dislocated. Berlin and the other major cities were in ruins, and recovery took decades.  - The Dutch Republic, also known as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands ('), Republic of the United Netherlands or Republic of the Seven United Provinces ('), was a republic in Europe existing from 1581, when part of the Netherlands separated from Spanish rule, until 1795. It preceded the Batavian Republic, the Kingdom of Holland, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and ultimately the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands. Alternative names include the United Provinces ('), Seven Provinces ('), Federated Dutch Provinces ('), and Dutch Federation (').  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - Maine Maritime Academy is a public post-secondary college and nautical training institution with approximately 900 students, located in Castine in Hancock County, Maine, USA. The Academy was established by the 90th Maine Legislature on March 21, 1941. Maine Maritime Academy is a public college. Costs of admission are comparable to the nearby University of Maine. Unlike federal service academies, a congressional recommendation is not required to attend this state school. Students are not obligated to go to sea or into the military after graduation, and a large portion of the graduating class chooses shore-side employment, often in maritime related fields or the power generation industry.  - The Holocene is the geological epoch that began after the Pleistocene at approximately 11,700 years before present. The term \\"Recent\\" (usually capitalised) has often been used as an exact synonym of \\"Holocene\\", although this usage is discouraged in 21st-century science. The Holocene is part of the Quaternary period. Its name comes from the Ancient Greek words (\\"holos\\", whole or entire) and (\\"kainos\\", new), meaning \\"entirely recent\\". It has been identified with the current warm period, known as MIS 1, and can be considered an interglacial in the current ice age based on that evidence.  - Penobscot Bay originates from the mouth of Maine's Penobscot River. 11,000 years ago, at the beginning of the Holocene era, the Gulf of Maine's sea level fell as low as 180 feet (55 m) below its present height. Penobscot Bay was then a continuation of Penobscot River that meandered through a broad lowland extending past present day Matinicus Island. Penobscot Bay is between Muscongus Bay and Blue Hill Bay.  - New France was the area colonized by France in North America during a period beginning with the exploration of the Saint Lawrence River by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Spain and Great Britain in 1763. At its peak in 1712 (before the Treaty of Utrecht), the territory of \\"New France\\", also sometimes known as the \\"French North American Empire\\" or \\"Royal New France\\", extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, including all the Great Lakes of North America.  - Fort Pentagouet (Fort Pentagoet, Fort Castine, Fort Penobscot, Fort St. Pierre) was a French fort established in present-day Castine, Maine, which was the capital of Acadia (16701674). It is the oldest permanent settlement in New England.  - Acadia was a colony of New France in northeastern North America that included parts of eastern Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and modern-day Maine to the Kennebec River. During much of the 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southernmost settlements of Acadia. The actual specification by the French government for the territory refers to lands bordering the Atlantic coast, roughly between the 40th and 46th parallels. Later, the territory was divided into the British colonies which became Canadian provinces and American states. The population of Acadia included members of the Wabanaki Confederacy and descendants of emigrants from France (i.e., Acadians). The two communities intermarried, which resulted in a significant portion of the population of Acadia being Métis.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Franco-Dutch War (167278), often called simply the Dutch War, was a war fought by France, Sweden, Münster, Cologne and England against the Dutch Republic, which was later joined by the Austrian Habsburg lands, Brandenburg-Prussia and Spain to form a Quadruple Alliance. The war ended with the Treaty of Nijmegen, by which Spain ceded the Franche-Comté and some cities in Flanders and Hainaut to France, while France returned some of its conquests (Maastricht and the Principality of Orange) to the Dutch.  - Castine is a town in Hancock County in eastern Maine, USA, which served from 1670 to 1674 as the capital of Acadia. The population was 1,366 at the 2010 census. Castine is the home of Maine Maritime Academy, a four-year institution that graduates officers and engineers for the United States Merchant Marine and marine related industries. Approximately 1000 students are enrolled. During the French colonial period, Castine was the southern tip of Acadia and briefly served as the regional capital.  - Münster (Low German: \\"Mönster\\"; Latin: \\"Monasterium\\", from the Greek  \\"monastrion\\", \\"monastery\\") is an independent city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is in the northern part of the state and is considered to be the cultural centre of the Westphalia region. It is also capital of the local government region Münsterland. Münster was the location of the Anabaptist rebellion during the Protestant Reformation and the site of the signing of the Treaty of Westphalia ending the Thirty Years' War in 1648. Today it is known as the bicycle capital of Germany.  - The Principality of Orange (in French \\"la Principauté d'Orange\\") was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in Provence, in the south of modern-day France, on the left bank of the river Rhone north of the city of Avignon.   - Jurriaen Aernoutsz ( or Aernouts ) was a Dutch colonial navy captain , who briefly conquered the capital of Acadia , Fort Pentagouet in Penobscot Bay ( present day Castine , Maine ) and several other villages , and renamed the colony New Holland during the Franco - Dutch War . The commander of the frigate Flying Horse , based at Curaçao during the Third Anglo - Dutch War , Aernoutsz was dispatched by the governor of Curaçao to fight French and English ships in the North Atlantic after the Netherlands recaptured New York City . By the time he reached New York , however , the English and the Dutch had made peace in the Treaty of Westminster -- but with the Franco - Dutch War still underway , Aernoutsz met with John Rhoades and decided to attack Acadia . On August 10 , 1674 , Aernoutsz and the crew of the Flying Horse captured Fort Pentagouet in two hours . He then sailed up the Bay of Fundy , pillaging several French posts along the coast and ending at Fort Jemseg , which he also captured . Aernoutsz claimed Acadia as the Dutch territory of New Holland , burying bottles at both Pentagouet and Jemseg to assert his claim , and remained in Acadia for about a month . He subsequently returned to Boston in mid-September , disposing of his pillage and selling the cannon from Pentagouet to the government of Massachusetts . Aernoutsz then returned to Curaçao in October , leaving Rhoades and company in Boston with orders to return to Acadia to maintain possession of the territory . Once in Acadia , Rhoades began seizing New England vessels coming to trade with the Wabanaki Confederacy . As a result , the government of Massachusetts apprehended the party and tried them as pirates , during which time the French regained control of the territory without any military opposition . The Dutch continued to consider New Holland part of their colonial empire in North America , appointing Cornelius Van Steenwyk as Dutch governor of the territory in 1676 , but this was largely a paper designation -- in actual practice , the region...  - Franche-Comté (literally \\"Free County\\", Frainc-Comtou dialect: \\"Fraintche-Comtè\\"; ) is a former administrative region and a traditional province of eastern France.

Summarize this article: Matthew Keys, former deputy social media editor for the Reuters news agency, was convicted Wednesday for his role in a conspiracy to hack Los Angeles Times and Tribune Co. servers.      Keys, 28, who also was a web producer for KTXL Fox 40 in Sacramento, a Tribune-owned television station, provided members of the hacker group Anonymous with login information for Tribune servers in 2010.      Though Keys faces up to 25 years in prison at his sentencing, U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Lauren Horwood said prosecutors are \\"likely\\" to seek less than five years.      Keys' attorney, Jay Leiderman, said they will appeal after Keys’ sentencing, which is scheduled for Jan. 20 in Sacramento.      “He shouldn’t be doing a day in jail,” Leiderman said. “With love and respect, [The Times'] story was defaced for 40 minutes when someone found it and fixed it in three minutes. What do you want, a year a minute?”      Keys, who works as a managing editor for Grasswire, a news curation website, said he will continue to report until his sentencing.      Edward Snowden, who exposed the mass-surveillance practices of the National Security Agency, tweeted about Keys' potential sentence, followed by #PrisonPolicy.      “I appreciate the support that everyone is sending my way,” Keys said in response. “This affects our ability to keep sources confidential. I hope they funnel that outrage and anger into progress.”      In their indictment, federal prosecutors alleged Keys conspired with Anonymous members to access the Tribune Co.'s servers \\"for the purpose of learning how to alter and damage it.\\" According to federal authorities, Keys provided a username and password for Tribune servers to hackers in an online chat room after he left KTXL in late October 2010.      A jury convicted Keys of one count of conspiracy to make changes to Tribune’s website and damage its computer systems, one count of transmitting malicious code and one count of attempting to transmit malicious code.      With the information from Keys, prosecutors say, a hacker accessed a news story on The Times' website and changed a headline on a story about tax cuts to read: \\"Pressure builds in House to elect CHIPPY 1337.\\"      \\"[T]hat was such a buzz having my edit on the LA Times,\\" the hacker, using the screen name \\"sharpie,\\" wrote to Keys, according to the indictment.      \\"Nice,\\" Keys, using the screen name \\"AESCracked,\\" allegedly replied.      Keys said he was using a virtual private network \\"to cover my tracks,\\" according to the indictment.      Prosecutors wrote in the indictment that Tribune spent more than 5,000 responding to the attack and restoring its systems.      According to the indictment, Keys conspired with hackers via a chat room known as \\"internetfeds.\\"      Keys had written about gaining access to the chat room and communicating with hackers in a blog post for Reuters last year. Keys said the chat room was a \\"top secret\\" place where \\"elite hackers assembled.\\"      \\"If there was a political or economic reason behind their mayhem, so much the better. If not, they did it for kicks,\\" he wrote of the hackers' motivations for their attacks.      He wrote in the post about the hack on The Times' site, without acknowledging any personal involvement.      Keys was fired from Reuters shortly after federal prosecutors launched their case against him, though the company said he was let go for social media activities.      “Although this case has drawn attention because of Matthew Keys’ employment in the news media, this was simply a case about a disgruntled employee who used his technical skills to taunt and torment his former employer,” U.S. Atty. Benjamin Wagner said in a statement. “Although he did no lasting damage, Keys did interfere with the business of news organizations, and caused the Tribune Company to spend thousands of dollars protecting its servers. Those who use the Internet to carry out personal vendettas against former employers employers should know that there are consequences for such conduct.”      In an interview with The Times following his conviction, Keys used an expletive to describe the government’s case against him and tweeted the same sentiment. He said prosecutors only went after him after he published information in 2011 that he gleaned from unnamed online sources, and refused to cooperate with federal investigators in a separate probe.      “They would love it if journalists who get background or go into dark places would play ball in criminal investigations,” Keys said of prosecutors. “But we’re under no obligation to do that. That’s how we get out our stories – by protecting our sources.”      ------------      FOR THE RECORD      An earlier version of this post misquoted Keys as saying, \\"But we're under no obligation to do that. That's how we get out our sources - by protecting our sources.\\" It should have said, \\"But we're under no obligation to do that.

Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter >>      He drew similarities between the case against him and the government seizure of Associated Press phone records and the prosecution of a New York Times reporter for refusing to divulge a source, as examples. He had no part in the hacking of The Times site, in which the headline of an article was defaced, he said.      “Are you guys really that offended?” Keys asked a Times reporter. “Shame on the Tribune Co. for being complicit in this.”      U.S. Atty. Matthew Segal, lead prosecutor in the case, said Keys’ assertion that he was targeted by the government as retribution for his work and to have him reveal his sources was baseless. “It’s silly,” he said.      Segal said Keys signed a confession and offered to cooperate with authorities.      “Anybody with any doubt as to what happened here can read the statement that Keys wrote and gave to the FBI,” Segal said. “He admitted what he did and offered to cooperate.”      Keys said that when FBI agents executed a search warrant at his home in 2012, he was under the influence of medication and was directed by an agent to write the statement. Keys said the statement was coerced and that he and his lawyers intend to address the issue on appeal.      “It’s wrong to call it a confession,” he said. “Armed FBI agents who just pointed a gun at my face were telling me what to write.” ||||| TAKE ME UP ||||| An ex-Reuters employee has been found guilty of aiding members of Anonymous so they could hack his former employer, the Tribune Company.      Matthew Keys, who was tried in Sacramento, was an online social media editor for the Reuters news agency when he was indicted in 2013 for allegedly providing a username and password to members of Anonymous to gain access to the server of his former employer, the Tribune Company. He allegedly encouraged the hackers to use the credentials to “go fuck some shit up.” Someone subsequently used the credentials to hack into the web site of the Los Angeles Times, which is owned by the Tribune Company, and change the headline of a story.      Keys was indicted in the Eastern District of California with three counts—including conspiracy and the transmission of data to damage a computer.      According to authorities, during a recorded FBI interview with Keys in October 2012 at his home, prior to his indictment, he admitted to his involvement in the hacking of the L.A. Times, and to sending a series of disparaging, sometimes threatening e-mails to a former employer. Keys waived his Miranda rights at the time of the interview and was concerned that the case not be publicized, apparently believing he might get off as a cooperating witness.      “My concern is this eventually getting out there under my name, um, and I know that there are ways that, you know, like calling me a cooperating witness or, or something like that,” authorities say he told the FBI. “There’s, whatever in your ability to minimalize [sic] … the impact.”      At the time, authorities used a search warrant to seize a laptop and two external hard drives from Keys.      But Keys argued that the search warrant was unconstitutionally broad. He asked the court to suppress not only information obtained with the search warrant and other evidence, but also oral and written statements he made to the FBI.      And although he waived his Miranda rights at the time of the interview, he claimed he did not do so “knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily” because earlier that morning he had taken double his prescribed dose of an anti-depression medication called Trazodone and had only had four hours of sleep when the FBI woke him to search his residence.      The government argued, however, that it only took items specified in the warrant and that it authorized agents to “search, copy, image and seize” the items investigators took. Authorities say they needed to conduct a broad search of Keys laptop because the computer itself had been used in the alleged crime, and investigators were concerned that Keys might have moved or hidden evidence (.pdf). They cited a child pornography case as precedent for why broad searches are sometimes needed when the computer is part of the crime.      In the end, a federal judge refused to dismiss the recorded confession and the computer evidence.      Keys faces a possible sentence of up to 25 years. His sentencing hearing has been set for January 20.      The headline of this story has been updated. Keys was convicted of helping Anonymous hack the Tribune Company, not Reuters. ||||| SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A well-known social media journalist was found guilty Wednesday of conspiring with the hacking group Anonymous to break into the Los Angeles Times' website and alter a story.      Matthew Keys, 28, of Vacaville, was convicted of giving the group the login credentials to The Tribune Co.'s computer system. The company owns the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun and other media companies.      He was fired by Tribune-owned FOX affiliate KTXL-TV in Sacramento two months before the Times' website was hacked, and federal prosecutors in Sacramento say he wanted payback. He was fired by the Reuters news agency after charges were filed in 2013.      Prosecutors say a hacker used the login information that Keys posted in an Internet chat room to gain access to the Times' computer system and alter a December 2010 story. They say Keys encouraged the hacking and praised the results.      His attorneys contended that any alteration was a relatively harmless prank that did not merit charges carrying a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in federal prison. As a first-time offender, prosecutors say Keys will face far less time at his Jan. 20 sentencing.      Tor Ekeland, one of the defense attorneys, said in an email that Keys will appeal, but he did not comment further.      \\"Although this case has drawn attention because of Matthew Keys' employment in the news media, this was simply a case about a disgruntled employee who used his technical skills to taunt and torment his former employer,\\" U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner said in a statement.      Court documents say the hacking cost Tribune nearly 18,000 for the 333 hours that employees spent responding to the hack. But Keys' attorneys said restoring the original headline, byline and first paragraphs of the story took less than an hour and the cost falls below the 5,000 loss required to make the violation a felony. ||||| Summary:","output":"A former employee of Reuters news agency, Matthew Keys, has been found guilty of helping a group of hackers called Anonymous break into a computer system owned by a media company called Tribune, and change a story on the Los Angeles Times website.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs.

They scored first with Michael Vick hooking up with Riley Cooper on a 2-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead, however, the Boys responded with Tony Romo finding Felix Jones on an 11-yard pass for a 7-7 lead.  Then increased their lead in the 2nd quarter as Dan Bailey kicked a 30-yard field goal for a 10-7 halftime lead.  Michael Vick had been knocked out of the game and was possibly out for the season after going 6/9 for 70 yards and a touchdown pass.  Rookie QB Nick Foles would get his first NFL action and threw his first touchdown pass to Jeremy Maclin from 44 yards out as the Eagles retook a 14-10 lead while Henery moved the team ahead 17-10 with a 40-yard field goal.  After this, the Cowboys went back to work as Romo found Dez Bryant on a 30-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 17-17.  Then the Boys retook the lead with Dwayne Harris returned a punt 78-yards for a touchdown for a 24-17 lead followed up by Brandon Carr returning an interception 47 yards for a touchdown and a 31-17 lead.  The Eagles then got back to work with Stanley Havili 1-yard touchdown run (with a failed PAT) to shorten the lead to 31-23.

Given the two facts above, what can be added to a solid to decrease its freezing point? Select from the following. [A]. oxygen [B]. ice [C]. an ion [D]. NaCl [E]. potash [F]. Acids [G]. sugar [H]. h2o Answer:","output":"Answer: [D]. NaCl Explanation: Based on the given facts, we understand that adding salt to a solid decreases its freezing point, and salt is exemplified by NaCl (sodium chloride). Therefore, by adding NaCl to a solid, its freezing point will decrease.  Let's dive deeper into why this happens. The process is known as freezing point depression, and it is a colligative property of solutions. Colligative properties are properties of solutions that depend on the ratio of solute to solvent particles but not on the nature of the particles themselves. When salt (NaCl) is added to a solid (such as ice or water), the dissolved salt molecules dissociate into ions: one sodium ion (Na+) and one chloride ion (Cl-). These ions spread throughout the solvent and disrupt the uniform arrangement of the solvent particles (in this case, water molecules), making it more difficult for the solid to form its crystalline lattice structure when freezing. As a result, the freezing point of the solution becomes lower than the freezing point of the pure solvent. In other words, more energy needs to be removed from the solution as the salt interferes with the solid's capacity to freeze. This characteristic is the primary reason why salt is often used on icy roads or walkways during winter as it lowers the freezing point of water, causing it to melt and preventing ice from forming. To summarize, given the facts provided, NaCl (sodium chloride) can be added to a solid to decrease its freezing point. The presence of the dissociated ions in the solution impacts its freezing point by making it more difficult for the solvent particles to come together and form a solid crystalline structure, which is ultimately the cause of the freezing point depression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Baroness Margaret Thatcher appears to have been well-liked across the pond, as many American politicians have reflected on their respect of the now-deceased British leader. Among her admirers is former First Lady Nancy Reagan, the widow of President Ronald Reagan - who worked closely with the so-called Iron Lady. Reagan and Thatcher joined forces in the early 1980s and drastically changed the economic and political landscapes in both of their countries. Scroll down for video. 'Special relationship': Former First Lady Nancy Reagan (seen here in 1991) said she was too frail to attend Mrs Thatcher's funeral but she mourned her loss. Their calls for more-austere government and lower taxes still resonate with conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic. And their side-by-side standing up to. Soviet communism is credited by those of all political stripes as. hastening the end of the Cold War. Dynamic duo: Reagan and Thatcher's calls for more-austere government and lower taxes still resonate with conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic. Speaking to MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell yesterday, Mrs Reagan said that it wasn't just her husband who got along well with Mrs Thatcher, but she did as well. 'We had a very special relationship,' Mrs Reagan said via phone. 'I think people thought she and I didn't have a relationship. Nothing could be farther from the truth. And of course I loved it that she and Ronnie were as close as they were.' Also singing Thatcher's praises was President Barack Obama, who said that America 'has lost a true friend.' The kind words came amid the revelation that Thatcher died in the luxury suite at the Ritz where she had spent months recuperating after an operation. Britain's first and only female prime minister, who passed away peacefully at the age of 87 after suffering a massive stroke, had checked into the five star hotel at the start of the year following minor surgery on her bladder over Christmas. While a close-knit circle of friends. took it in turns to visit the increasingly frail 87-year-old at the. Belgravia hotel - a long-time favorite of the former leader's - it was a. solitary start to what would prove to be her final few months. She had been due to spend Christmas Day. with her niece Jane Mays, who lives in north east London, but was. admitted to hospital five days earlier for minor surgery to remove a. growth on her bladder. Iron Lady: Baroness Thatcher, who died today, was pictured on a bench in Battersea Park, London with her carers and a police officer. Ritz: Media and police were gathered outside the five star Ritz Hotel in London today, where Baroness Thatcher died after suffering a massive stroke. Her daughter Carol Thatcher, 59, was understood to be at her side in the hospital at Christmas time. After being discharged Baroness Thatcher was checked straight into a suite at the hotel in Belgravia amid concerns she would no longer be able to manage the stairs at her elegant four-story mansion. Staff at the hotel had invited her to make the Ritz her home for the foreseeable future, and her carers are understood to have been taking it in turns to stay with the 87-year-old. Yesterday Carol dashed home from Swiss ski resort Klosters, where she lives for part of the year, to be with her ailing mother, her neighbours said. The mother of two, who was Britain's. first and only female prime minister, had spent the previous two. Christmases without either Carol or her twin brother Sir Mark. Close. friends of the former prime minister said after she was discharged that. she was in 'sparkling form' following the procedure, but admitted the. experience had been 'very draining' for her. Home life: The former prime minister had spent recent Christmases without her children Carol (pictured with her mother) and Mark. The spell in hospital followed more than a decade of fragile health for Baroness Thatcher after she suffered a series of minor strokes in 2002. She had been suffering from acute short-term memory loss, which could make social gatherings an unsettling experience, and in recent years the once formidable Iron Lady had all but disappeared from public view. Alongside her health issues, in 2003 Baroness Thatcher suffered the devastating loss of her husband Denis, 88, who she had described as the 'golden thread running through my life.' The life-altering loss heralded the. start of a new chapter in her life, one in which she appeared to spend. increasing periods of time without her close family around her. Loved ones: Family was said to be essential in the life of Baroness Thatcher, who was mother to Carol, left, who rushed home from a ski trip in Klosters, Switzerland, yesterday, and Sir Mark, right. 'Golden thread': Baroness Thatcher's husband Denis died in 2003 at the age of 88 after suffering heart problems and pancreatic cancer. Although she was a mother of two, it was. with Mrs Mayes - the daughter of Baroness Thatcher's late older sister. Muriel - that she had been due to spend last Christmas before she fell. ill. She dined with Mrs Mayes and her family on Christmas Day 2011, while both Carol and Mark spent the festive season abroad. The former prime minister had credited her husband, who was 10 years her senior, as the man 'who has made everything possible.' Honoured: Baroness Thatcher will receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours, Downing Street has said. She met her husband while fighting the Dartford constituency - which she lost - in 1950. Denis, the director of a paint firm, helped the fledgeling politician by driving her around. They married in the autumn of 1951 when Baroness Thatcher was 26. As she went on to embark upon a career at the highest echelons of British politics, she relied on Denis as a constant source of discreet support. The pair had enjoyed an marriage lasting more than 50 years, but Baroness Thatcher's family life was not without moments of crisis. Some months after the death of her. husband she endured a second personal trauma when their son, Sir Mark,. was charged in August 2004 with plotting a coup to overthrow the. Government of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea - a charge which could, in its. extreme, have led to the death penalty. Baroness Thatcher, already suffering ill health, was deeply upset by the news about her son, to whom she was devoted. To her intense relief, he entered a guilty plea and was punished with a large fine and a suspended prison sentence. Baroness Thatcher was well enough to. celebrate her 87th birthday with Sir Mark, 59, and his wife at a London. restaurant last October. She had also enjoyed robust health during her term as Prime Minister. Unlike. her predecessor at 10 Downing Street, James Callaghan, Mrs Thatcher did. not have a doctor accompanying her on foreign trips. Days gone by: The then Conservative Party leader is seen strolling through the grounds of Scotney Castle in Kent with husband Denis and their twins Mark and Carol in 1979. Upsetting: Sir Mark is seen outside the High Court in Cape Town in 2004, after pleading guilty to charges of plotting a coup to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea. Once, when she was asked by Lee Kuan Yew, who was prime minister of Singapore, why she did not travel with a doctor, she replied: 'I would have ended up looking after the doctor'. But in the past decade, she had become increasing frail. In 2002, she made her first concession to increasing age when she cut back her workload on the advice of doctors. Concern about her health had been growing and it emerged she had suffered a minor stroke shortly before New Year 2002 during her golden wedding anniversary holiday with Sir Denis Thatcher in Madeira. The series of minor strokes forced her to retire from public speaking. Despite this, in May 2004 - the 25th anniversary of her election as Prime Minister - she defied doctors' orders to speak at a dinner held in her honour, attacking the Blair Government and praising Michael Howard, then Tory leader. In 2008, Lady Thatcher succumbed to the heat at a dinner in the House of Lords and fainted. She was taken to nearby St Thomas's Hospital for tests, but was allowed to go home the following day. Recuperation: Baroness Thatcher started the year convalescing at the Ritz in central London after undergoing minor surgery over Christmas. Tributes: Notes and bouquets were piling up outside the former prime minister's home in London following the news of her death today. That year her daughter Carol admitted that her mother suffered from dementia. She said she first noticed her mother's previously formidable memory was failing in 2000 and she had to be repeatedly. reminded about the death of her husband, each time reacting to the sad. news as if it were the first time she had heard it. Baroness Thatcher died after. suffering from a stroke - a condition which kills around 45,000 people. every year in the UK - and is the third largest cause of death, after. heart disease and cancer. The risk of stroke rises. significantly with age. And 40,000 of those who die each year are over. the age of 75, according to the Stroke Association. Although men have a higher risk of stroke, women are one and a half times as likely to die from one.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","output":"- Not impacting any step of the process The given question pertains to the process of filtration and waste removal by the kidneys. The question then changes the topic drastically to the seemingly unrelated subject of using less pancake mix. Unless a very obscure indirect relationship is implied in the scenario, the pancake mix does not have an obvious or understood influence on the kidney function or waste removal process. In our body, kidneys are the primary excretory organs which filtrate the blood and remove unnecessary or harmful metabolic substances produced by our body cells. These substances, combined with water, form the urine which is then expelled from our body. This urinary system process can be influenced by factors such as hydration, diet, physical health, and the presence of any diseases or disorders. When we consider the use of less pancake mix, we're stepping into the realms of nutrition and diet. Pancake mix might affect the body's nutritional intake like carbohydrates, sugars or fats, but it does not have a direct or known indirect effect on how the kidneys process and filter blood to create urine.  Pancake mix could indirectly influence body processes through its nutritional content or lack thereof. But speaking strictly about the urinary system and kidney function, this would not drastically alter the described process. If perhaps we were considering a diet extremely high in sodium or protein, which could put additional strain on the kidneys and may potentially damage them over time, we might then be able to draw a hypothetical indirect relationship, but this also is not directly related to using less pancake mix either.  In conclusion, since no proper relationship is specified between the use of less pancake mix and kidney function, we must assume that this does not impact any step of the filtration process or waste removal from the body by the kidneys, making it a perturbation that does neither directly nor indirectly impact any step of the involved process."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Step 2: Heat the water The water should be comfortably hot, but not scalding. You can heat the water using a kettle, a microwave, or let hot tap water flow into your bowl. Be careful not to burn yourself while handling hot water. Step 3: Wet the washcloth or towel Submerge the clean washcloth or towel in the hot water. Ensure the entire cloth is soaked with the hot water, which will help retain the heat for a longer period. Step 4: Wring out excess water Carefully wring out the excess water from the washcloth or towel by squeezing it. Remember not to twist or wring too tightly, as this can trap heat unevenly and make it too hot to apply on your skin. Step 5: Test the temperature Before applying the hot compress to your face, test its temperature by gently pressing it against the inside of your wrist or the back of your hand. Make sure it is warm and bearable to touch without causing any discomfort. Step 6: Apply the hot compress to the affected area Place the warm, wet washcloth or towel gently on the acne spot or the area of your skin you want to treat. Hold it there for about 10-15 minutes, or until the washcloth or towel loses heat. You can repeat this process multiple times a day to help soothe the pain and inflammation associated with acne. Step 7: Clean up After using the hot compress, wash the cloth or towel, and properly dispose of the water. If you used a plastic bag or microwave-safe container, clean and store them properly for future use. Step 8: Moisturize After the hot compress treatment, ensure you moisturize your skin to prevent dryness. Use a non-comedogenic (non-pore clogging) moisturizer suitable for your skin type to maintain skin health. Step 9: Maintain hygiene Continue to wash your hands regularly throughout the day and avoid touching your face to prevent spreading bacteria and dirt that can worsen acne. By following these steps and precautions, you can use a hot compress to help treat acne and promote better skin health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Background: The Khmer Krom (Khmer: khmaerkroom, Vietnamese: Kho Me Crom) are ethnically Khmer people living in the south western part of Vietnam, where they are recognized as one of Vietnam's fifty-three ethnic minorities. In the Khmer language, Krom means \\"lower\\" or \\"below\\", as it refers to an area of 89,000 square kilometres (34,363 sq mi) around modern day Saigon and the Mekong Delta, which used to be the southeasternmost territory of the Khmer Empire until its incorporation into Vietnam under the Nguyen lords in the early 18th century. This marks the final stage of the Vietnamese \\"March to the South\\" (nam tien). Context: In the 17th century a weakened Khmer state left the Mekong Delta poorly administered after repeated warfare with Siam. Concurrently Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Trinh-Nguyen War in Vietnam migrated into the area. In 1623 Cambodian king Chey Chettha II (1618-1628) officially sanctioned the Vietnamese immigrants to operate a custom house at Prey Nokor, then a small fishing village. The settlement steadily grew soon becoming a major regional port, attracting even more settlers.  In 1698 the Nguyen Lords of Hue commissioned Nguyen Huu Canh, a Vietnamese noble to organize the territory along Vietnamese administrative lines, thus by de facto detaching it from the Kingdom of Cambodia and incorporating it into Vietnam.  With the loss of the port of Prey Nokor, then renamed Sai Gon, Cambodia's control of the area grew increasingly tenuous while increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers to the Delta isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from the Cambodian kingdom. By 1757 the Vietnamese had absorbed the provinces of Psar Dek (renamed Sa Dec in Vietnamese) on the Mekong itself, and Moat Chrouk (Vietnamized to Chau Doc) on the Bassac River.  Minh Mang enacted assimilation policies upon the Khmer such as forcing them to adopt Sino-Vietnamese surnames, culture, and clothing. Minh Mang sinicized ethnic minorities including the Cambodians, in line with Confucianism as he diffused Vietnamese culture with China's Han civilization using the term Han people Han Ren  for the Vietnamese. Minh Mang declared that \\"We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.\\" These policies were directed at the Khmer and hill tribes.  On June 4, 1949 the French President Vincent Auriol signed the accord reincorporating Cochinchina to Vietnam. This was done without consulting the indigenous Khmer-Krom. The legal transfer of control cut Cambodia off from the sea via the Mekong River as the Delta administered by an independent Vietnam. Left within the borders of Vietnam were the communities of Khmer people, nowadays Khmer Krom. Question: What did Khmer do? Answer:","output":"The Khmer people, specifically the Khmer Krom, are an ethnically Khmer group living in the southwestern part of Vietnam. Over the years, they have faced cultural assimilation policies, territorial annexation, and challenges in retaining their unique identity within the Vietnamese state. Some of the significant actions taken by the Khmer Krom throughout history include: 1. Managing the Mekong Delta: In the 17th century, the Khmer people managed the Mekong Delta, though with weakened administrative capacity due to repeated warfare with neighboring Siam. 2. Allowing Vietnamese migration: Under Cambodian King Chey Chettha II, the Khmer allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing from the Trinh-Nguyen War in Vietnam to settle in the area and operate a custom house at Prey Nokor, which eventually evolved into a major regional port, attracting more settlers. 3. Losing control over territory: Over time, the Khmer people lost control over the Mekong Delta region, as Vietnamese settlers continued to migrate and establish themselves in the area. The Nguyen Lords of Hue commissioned Nguyen Huu Canh to organize the territory along Vietnamese administrative lines, thereby detaching it from Cambodia and incorporating it into Vietnam. 4. Enduring assimilation policies: During the reign of Vietnamese Emperor Minh Mang, the Khmer, along with other ethnic minority groups, faced assimilation policies that aimed to make them adopt Sino-Vietnamese culture and customs. This included changes to their clothing, surnames, and daily practices, making it increasingly difficult for the Khmer people to maintain their unique identity. 5. Facing territorial annexation: In 1949, the French President Vincent Auriol signed an accord reincorporating Cochinchina into Vietnam without consulting the indigenous Khmer Krom people. This resulted in the loss of access to the sea via the Mekong River, cutting Cambodia off from its critical maritime resources and leaving the Khmer Krom people within the borders of Vietnam. Throughout these historical events, the Khmer Krom people have persevered in the face of assimilation, annexation, and the gradual erosion of their unique cultural identity. Despite these challenges, they continue to remain a part of Vietnam's diverse ethnic landscape and strive to preserve their Khmer heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 23 January 1995. Toadie was created by writer Elizabeth Packett. Moloney had previously auditioned for another role in the show and had played a minor character, before being cast as Toadie. Toadie's nickname was derived from the toadfishes of Australia. The serial's official website described a young Toadie as \\"fun-loving, mischievous and the class clown.\\" TV Week branded Toadie \\"another troubled-teen-turned-good\\" who was \\"fond of a practical joke\\". Soap opera reporting website, Holy Soap, said he was \\"initially a bit of a layabout\\" that \\"got his act together and qualified as a lawyer.\\" He also observed him as coming in \\"as a rough bloke and now he's a nancy.\\" Toadie is portrayed as an \\"unlucky in love character\\". He would often be played as the \\"third-wheel\\" alongside Billy Kennedy (Jesse Spencer), who was more popular with female characters. In 2003, Moloney said: \\"Billy always got the chicks and it annoyed me because I wanted a chance at pashing someone... and now it's all making up for lost time.\\" Moloney said when Toadie is \\"not in love and when he's not heartbroken\\" he has the ability to do anything he wants.  Toadie's persona is similar to Moloney's in the sense that they both \\"mess around\\". He further added, \\"In fact he is me, seeing how much fun and frivolity I can get away with.\\" Molony documented Toadie changing from \\"a bit of a bad boy\\" into a \\"lawyer who's supposedly a responsible member of the community.\\" He felt that to begin with Toadie was not a good lawyer, because many his clients would receive prison sentences. On Toadie's professionalism, Moloney said he is the type of lawyer that \\"probably likes to take his pants off behind the desk.\\"  Toadie's image has changed repeatedly during his tenure. When he first appeared in 1995, he had long hair. He used to style a mullet similar to Scott Robinson's (Jason Donovan) hairstyle. Moloney jested that it appeared as though a possum was on his head.

The waterfall's towering measurements and spectacular drop make it the tallest waterfall in the world, unchallenged by any other known falls. Interestingly, Angel Falls is named after Jimmy Angel, a US aviator, who, as per various accounts, was the first to fly over the falls in mid-20th century. However, the indigenous Pemon people had known the falls for centuries and called it Kerepakupai Meru, meaning \\"waterfall of the deepest place\\", or Parakupá Vená, meaning \\"the fall from the highest point\\".

Former Match of the Day presenter Jimmy Hill is suffering from Alzheimer’s, his family have revealed. Hill, who managed Coventry after playing for Fulham and Brentford, is now living in a care home near the south coast after his condition deteriorated. He was famously chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association and successfully campaigned for the abolition of the £20-a-week maximum wage, which was scrapped in 1961. Scroll down for video of Hill on Match of the Day... and as a linesman. Jimmy Hill presenting the BBC's Match of the Day in 1981 - he racked up 600 appearances on the show. At his best: Hill scores for Fulham against Manchester United in 1958. Sporting icon: Once a successful footballer and manager, Jimmy Hill, pictured in 1964, also became chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association in 1957. VIDEO: Hill introduces Match of the Day. It was one of the most seismic changes in football and meant that players not clubs controlled their earning power. Hill's Fulham team-mate Johnny Haynes was the first English player to earn £100 a week. That has arguably led to the player power of today, with stars such as Wayne Rooney and Yaya Toure earning upwards of £200,000 a week. Hill is fondly remembered in Coventry after an innovative spell as manager, during which he changed the colour of the club's kit and their nickname to the Sky Blues. This is still in use. He was also chairman of Coventry, and at Fulham and Charlton. If that wasn't enough, he once even ran the line at a First Division game at Highbury in 1972 after an official was injured and an appeal went out over the PA system for a replacement. He is probably better remembered now for his career as a broadcaster and he presented Match of the Day more than 600 times. Hill moved to Sky Sports in 1999 and fronted Jimmy Hill's Sunday Supplement, a panel show on which journalists discuss the football topics of the day. Jimmy Hill and Bryony at Buckingham Palace in 1995 - he received both an OBE and a CBE. The 85-year-old was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2008 but his condition was made public on Sunday by his youngest son Jamie, 46, and. his daughter Joanna, 50, who are his two children from his second. marriage. There is a legal wrangle concerning his welfare. Hill gave joint powers of. attorney to his current wife Bryony, 62, and a solicitor in 2005, when. he was still in good health. His five children from his two previous marriages only discovered the. existence of the legal document in 2008, when Hill was deemed by doctors. to be too ill to look after himself. It. was only then that the law required that his children be informed that. powers of attorney had been granted to Mrs Hill and the solicitor. As a result, none of his children has any say over his future treatment or the management of his assets. Jimmy Hill pictured at a Fulham v Chelsea match in 2006 - he was diagnosed in 2008, but his condition only came to light at the weekend. Mr. Hill Jnr, a property consultant and fitness coach who lives in west. London told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘He is the most sprightly physical specimen in the home, but his mind is not what it was. The home is the best place for him. That is not my complaint. ‘My concern is we only discovered in 2008 that power of attorney had been signed three years earlier. We said in 2008 that if Bryony’s lawyer steps aside and one of us children has joint power of attorney, we will be happy. ‘Unfortunately, that was declined. We were told they had considered giving one of the children power of attorney in 2005, but decided against because it would have been too difficult to choose just one.’ Mr Hill Jnr has raised the issue with his local MP, Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, who passed his concerns to Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor. Joanna Hill, who lives in Mexico, added: ‘It is a shame that we as his children have no rights over his treatment and care. ‘Children whose parents have married more than once should be made aware that they will be unable to influence their affairs if they register a power of attorney. Hill’s wife Bryony was unavailable for comment on Sunday. In his heyday as a TV presenter: Jimmy Hill, left, pictured with another presenter with a famous chin, Bruce Forsyth.

The context implies that the buses are designed or designated for taking passengers on a guided tour around notable points of interest and attractions within the city. This is a service that is typically available in many cities around the world. Such tour buses can come in various forms, including double-decker buses, open-top buses, minibuses, or customized vehicles designed specifically for sightseeing. Tour bus services often have predetermined routes that highlight popular tourist sites, historical landmarks, cultural institutions, and other points of interest. These routes are usually planned to offer a comprehensive, convenient, and accessible experience for passengers, allowing them to explore and appreciate the city's most remarkable features without having to navigate complex public transportation systems or rent private vehicles. Moreover, tour buses tend to provide additional facilities and services targeted at enhancing passengers' overall experience. These may include live or recorded audio commentary, providing insightful information about each attraction and point of interest passed along the tour; multilingual guides, catering to the diverse groups of tourists from different countries and backgrounds; and regular stops at select locations, giving passengers an opportunity to disembark, explore, and take photos before reboarding and continuing their journey. Some tour bus operators offer multiple ticket options and packages with varying price points, addressing different preferences, time constraints, and budgets. For example, some tickets might be valid for 24 or 48 hours, enabling passengers to hop on and off the bus at any stop within the validity period. Others may include a guided walking tour, entrance tickets to attractions, or access to other forms of transportation, such as river cruises or cable cars, to complement and diversify their city exploration. In conclusion, the statement, \\"Here you can pick up buses for a tour of city attractions,\\" directly contradicts the idea that the buses don't offer an option for touring the city attractions. The buses available at this location provide a valuable way for tourists and visitors to access, tour, and learn about the city's most beloved attractions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: A regular bedtime schedule is unquestionably helpful for parents, but a new study has found it that it may be even more beneficial for their children.      British researchers interviewed mothers when their children were ages 3, 5 and 7, asking how often their children had a regular bedtime: always, usually, sometimes or never. The mothers and the children’s teachers also completed questionnaires about behavioral difficulties.      Almost 20 percent of 3-year-olds had no regular bedtime, compared with 9.1 percent of 5-year-olds and 8.2 percent of 7-year-olds. After controlling for many social, economic and parental behavioral factors, the scientists found that children with a regular bedtime, whether early or late, had fewer behavioral problems. And the longer irregular bedtimes persisted, the more severe the difficulties were.      The study, published Monday in Pediatrics, also found that children who had irregular bedtimes at ages 3 and 5 had significant improvements in behavior scores if their bedtime was regular by age 7.      Still, the lead author, Yvonne Kelly, a professor of lifecourse epidemiology at University College London, warned against exaggerating the importance of the findings.      “Getting kids into a regular bedtime routine does appear to have important impacts on behavioral development,” she said. “But there are lots of things that have beneficial effects. Having a regular bedtime is only one of them.” ||||| It has long been considered the parental holy grail – a regular bedtime, adhered to by compliant children. But steady bedtimes can mean more than a few hours of peace for the adults, according to research which shows that children put to bed at the same time each day are significantly less likely to misbehave.      Children with erratic bedtimes are more likely to have behavioural problems – including hyperactivity, problems with peers and emotional difficulties – and demonstrate symptoms similar to jet lag.      For children who go for longer periods without a regular bedtime, there is a more pronounced impact, caused by disruptions to natural body rhythms that can cause sleep deprivation. This in turn has been found to undermine the way the brain matures and children's ability to behave well, according to a study of more than 10,000 children carried out by University College London (UCL).      But the impact of erratic sleep patterns was not found to be irreversible: parents who started putting their children to bed at consistent times noticed an improvement in their behaviour, as did teachers.      The data was collected via the UK Millennium Cohort Study, with bedtimes noted at ages three, five and seven, and information on behaviour collected from parents and teachers. Three-year-olds were the most likely to have erratic bedtimes, with one in five children going to bed at varying times. But by age seven, more than half of children went to bed regularly between 7.30pm and 8.30pm.      Children who had changeable bedtimes between the ages of three and five displayed better behaviour by age seven if their bedtimes had become more regular. If erratic bedtimes were not tackled, however, parents could expect their child's behaviour to progressively deteriorate.      Professor Yvonne Kelly, from UCL's department of epidemiology and public health, said early child development was well known to have profound influences on health and wellbeing throughout a lifetime. \\"Not having fixed bedtimes, accompanied by a constant sense of flux, induces a state of body and mind akin to jet lag and this matters for healthy development and daily functioning,\\" she said. \\"It follows that disruptions to sleep, especially if they occur at key times in development, could have important lifelong impacts on health.What we've shown is that these effects build up incrementally over childhood, so that children who always had irregular bedtimes were worse off than those children who did have a regular bedtime at one or two of the ages when they were surveyed.\\"      The study found that children whose bedtimes were irregular or who went to bed after 9pm were likely to come from more socially disadvantaged backgrounds. They were also more likely to have poor routines such as skipping breakfast, not being read to daily, having a television in their bedroom and spending longer in front of a TV than children with earlier bedtimes.      The research, published in the journal Pediatrics, said: \\"Family routines can be difficult to maintain when parents are working long and potentially unsociable hours, thus policy development is needed to better support families to provide conditions in which young children can flourish.\\"      Kelly added: \\"As it appears the effects of inconsistent bedtimes are reversible, one way to try to prevent this would be for healthcare providers to check for sleep disruptions as part of routine healthcare visits. Given the importance of early childhood development on subsequent health, there may be knockon effects across the life course. Therefore, there are clear opportunities for interventions aimed at supporting family routines that could have important lifelong impacts.\\" ||||| Kids with regular bedtimes tend to behave better, a new study finds.      Young children who don't have a regular bedtime behave worse than kids who go to sleep at the same time each night, a new study suggests.      British researchers found that both mothers and teachers rated 7-year-olds who had inconsistent bedtimes as being more hyperactive than their better-rested peers, and as having more social, emotional and conduct problems.      The results also revealed that behavior grew worse the more years a child spent without a firm bedtime. But the good news is that children's behavior noticeably improved when they switched to a scheduled bedtime.      \\"This is a very well-done study that in many ways reaffirms what we already know about a lack of sleep,\\" said Dr. Carolyn D'Ambrosio, director of the sleep center at Tufts Medical Center and the Floating Hospital for Children in Boston, who was not involved in the research.      She said the findings clearly show an association between kids behaving better and a regular bedtime. [10 Scientific Tips for Raising Happy Kids]      The study is published online today (Oct. 14) in the journal Pediatrics.      Sleepy kids      In the study, researchers looked at data from more than 10,000 children enrolled in the Millennium Cohort Study, a long-term study of babies born in the U.K. in 2001 and 2002.      When children were ages 3, 5 and 7, their mothers filled out questionnaires describing whether the child went to sleep at a regular time on weeknights during the school year, and what that bedtime was.      In addition, mothers and teachers evaluated 7-year-olds' behavior, assessing their conduct, relationships with classmates, emotional symptoms and hyperactivity levels.      Researchers found that almost 9 percent of the 7-year-olds lacked a regular bedtime.      Having an irregular sleep schedule had the greatest effect on a child's behavior, but kids with later bedtimes also tended to behave worse.      D'Ambrosio said the study findings strengthen the argument for a consistent bedtime for children because there were a large number of kids involved in the research, and their behavior was rated at three different ages.      For both kids and adults, \\"when people are sleep-deprived, they are a little bit moodier, have a shorter temper and their normal physiological processes aren't as finely tuned,\\" D'Ambrosio said.      \\"Kids don't say they're tired, they typically act it out -- most commonly by being hyperactive,\\" she said. In fact, the study found that erratic bedtimes had the strongest influence on children's hyperactivity levels, as judged by their mothers and teachers.      A lack of sleep also shows up in a child's school performance, moodiness, eating habits and as behavioral issues, D'Ambrosio said.      Bedtime tips      Having nighttime routines and a regular bedtime adds structure and consistency to a child's schedule, D'Ambrosio said.      An enforced bedtime helps kids to function their best the next day, and to get a regular amount of sleep. Kids ages 5 to 7 need 10 to 12 hours a night, she said.      This means enough sleep to get through all stages of sleep, which have important functions that regulate the body: For example, deep sleep helps people to wake up feeling refreshed, while REM sleep helps to improve memory skills.      Sufficient shut-eye is also critical for children because their young brains are still developing.      D'Ambrosio advised parents to start the process of regular bedtimes early in a child's life. This process involves letting children know when bedtime is coming and beginning their nightly routines -- brushing teeth, bathing, putting on pajamas, reading a story, dimming lights and allowing children to have a comfort item, such as a stuffed animal but limiting stimulating distractions, including a TV or iPad.      \\"Pick a bedtime that works for you and your family,\\" she recommended. \\"It may not work every night, but just keep trying.\\"      D'Ambrosio also suggested that kids have consistent bedtime schedules, even on weekends and during the summer.      She is quick to remind parents that \\"sleep is one of the most important things you can do for a child's health and behavior.\\"      Follow LiveScience @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Purchase either fine sandpaper (number 000) or use a nail file that you may have at your house. Use soft back-and-forth motions to sand at the gum. Try to avoid directly sanding the surface of the suede. Brush aside any gum that may come off.  Keep in mind that the sanding method will likely affect the suede. A tiny bit of the material may come off as you're sanding. This method is best left after you have tried other methods. It also may be the best method for items like shoes, which are below eye level. If your suede item is something that people will be looking at up close, keep in mind that the material will be affected. Sanding suede with a brush or emery board can affect the nap, or texture of the suede. After sanding, take a toothbrush, nail brush or suede brush and gently brush the nap of the suede, going in one direction. Brushing the suede can also brush away the gum removed during sanding.","output":"Although sandpaper may seem too rough for suede, it can be effectively used with a gentle touch. Fine sandpaper (number 000) or a nail file can be used to gently sand at gum stains, being careful not to directly sand the suede surface. This method is best for items like shoes and is not advised for items viewed up close due to potential damage. After sanding, use a toothbrush, nail brush, or suede brush to gently brush the suede in one direction to restore its nap or texture and remove any remaining gum."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Fact 1: Crumple means change shape from smooth into compacted by physical force.  Fact 2: Crumple the foil then carefully reopen it.  Given the two facts above, what can be changed from smooth to compacted by physical force? pick from the following.  -- Roads.  -- dirt.  -- h2o.  -- soils.  -- foil.  -- wood.  -- oxygen.  -- hair. Answer:","output":"Given the aforementioned facts, the substance that can be changed from smooth to compacted by physical force is 'foil'. The term 'crumple', particularly in the context provided, generally refers to the process of transforming a smooth item into a compact, wrinkled, or crumpled state, mostly by squeezing, bending, or crushing it. To break it down, let's examine each option: 1. Roads - Roads can be deformed due to physical forces, but they do not crumple in the sense suggested by the context above. 2. Dirt - Dirt can be compacted but not crumpled. When you apply force, it just compresses but doesn't form the characteristic wrinkles associated with crumpling. 3. H2O - H2O, or water, cannot be crumpled as it is a fluid and does not have a fixed shape. 4. Soils - Similar to dirt, soils can be compacted, but they cannot be crumpled since they lack the flexible, yet rigid nature needed for something to be crumpled. 5. Foil - Foil, such as aluminum foil, can easily be crumpled. It is initially smooth and when physical force like squeezing is applied, it changes shape, becoming compact and uneven. Once the force is removed, it maintains its crumpled shape. Therefore, it fits both the definition of \\"crumple\\" and the actions specified in Fact 2. 6. Wood - Wood, due to its rigid structure and composition, cannot be crumpled. It may be broken or split due to physical force, but not crumpled. 7. Oxygen - Oxygen is a gas and does not have a certain shape to crumple. 8. Hair - Hair can be crimped, curled, or straightened, but it cannot be crumpled in the context intended here. So, given that the process described requires something to be initially smooth and then become compacted and wrinkled through the application of physical force, foil is the substance that can undergo this change perfectly amongst the options provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Once he decided he must only eat meat that he had killed himself -- an admirable, if quirky, resolution for any vigorous young man with a rifle. Another time he decided to learn Mandarin Chinese -- not a simple task.  I wonder how that turned out?  Now he's vowed to start a book club, hoping to channel the reading attention of the millions who follow him on Facebook.  I like his latest idea a lot:  Anything that gets people reading and talking about books is a good thing. If I were Mr. Zuckerberg, I would aim for books that can be read slowly and carefully by busy people in their spare time, choosing ones with the capacity to enlarge their sense of what it means to be human and to live respectfully and generously among others.  Which ones would you pick? Here are 10 books that have meant a good deal to me  -- a mix of fiction and nonfiction:. 1.\\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" by Mark Twain.  This is the primary text of American literature, high on any serious list of world classics.  It's a book about the American soul, about race and community, and about the urgent need to \\"light out for the territory.\\"  As Huck and Jim float down the Mississippi on their quest for freedom, they take every reader of this truly great novel with them, forever. 2.\\"The Death of Ivan Ilyich,\\" by Leo Tolstoy. Written after Tolstoy's conversion to his own idiosyncratic version of Christianity, this short Russian novel brings us face to face with mortality.  Each of us, sooner or later, will die.  In the process of dying, Tolstoy's lead character comes to terms with his life and its meaning, which is made all the more vivid as it fades. 3.\\"July's People,\\" by Nadine Gordimer. This slim, intense novel appeared in 1981, not so long before apartheid had ended in South Africa.  It imagined a violent finale to that conflict between blacks and whites -- an ending that (fortunately) didn't materialize.  Yet this novel remains a strong evocation of cultural and racial differences; the sort of book that helps to explain racial divides that continues to haunt us. 4.\\"Walden,\\" by Henry David Thoreau.  Another great American book, one that makes the vital connection between spirit and nature.  It's an autobiographical masterpiece as well; the story of one man's quest for meaning in the wilderness.  It's a wry, touching, eloquent evocation of human consciousness as well as conscience.  Nobody can afford NOT to read this book slowly, carefully, more than once. 5.\\"Things Fall Apart,\\" by Chinua Achebe.   This fine African novel has been justifiably chosen by millions of readers as a book that gloriously summons the social, cultural and intensely personal situation of modern Africans living in the wake of colonial power.  Achebe saw his fellow Nigerians as individuals caught in a web of social relations, delineated here with clarity and confidence. 6.\\"Tao Te Ching,\\" by Laozi, translated by Stephen Mitchell.  This Chinese classic is one of the most influential books I have encountered in half a century of reading.  The art of living is beautifully unfolded here in 81 tiny chapters.  The author invites us to conform to the Tao itself, the universal principle of being, and his book teaches us how to live with ourselves and with others, how to govern a nation, a family, ourselves.  It is a book to live with and learn from, decade after decade. 7.\\"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,\\" by Annie Dillard.  This lovely work of American autobiography is about paying attention to one's surroundings.  Dillard explores the natural world around her home in the Blue Ridge Mountains, moving through the seasons, coming to terms with her own solitude, her sense of vocation as a writer, and her understanding of what faith means.  It's a book that should be read in tandem with Thoreau's \\"Walden.\\" 8.\\"What Is God?\\" by Jacob Needleman.  A philosopher and religious scholar, Needleman writes about his own spiritual journey from atheism to a more complex understanding of the source of all being.  Needleman asks:  \\"Who is wise?\\"  His answer is:   \\"one who learn from everything and everyone.\\"  This book asks, even answers, many of the basic questions about being human, drawing on a wide range of religious traditions. 9.\\"Of Woman Born:  Motherhood as Experience and Institution,\\" by Adrienne Rich.  Published in 1976, this eloquent meditation on motherhood is told from the viewpoint of one of the finest American poets of the 20th century.  It's a landmark study, a foundational book in modern feminist thought, and well worth reading, then rereading. 10.\\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" by Gabriel García Márquez. The longest book on my list, but nobody can afford to ignore it.  My old mentor, the Scottish poet Alastair Reid, used to say that anyone who hasn't read this book is still an intellectual virgin.  Márquez tells the story of a single family in a remote village in Colombia.  But this story is the human story writ small, the story of history itself, with its inevitable repetitions, its recurring ghosts, grounded in the nearly untranslatable poetry of human feeling. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article are: 1.

Yes The response \\"happiness\\" is indeed a valid answer to the question \\"How would Riley feel afterwards?\\" after seeing monkeys playing on the bars at the zoo. The scenario described in the question portrays a positive and entertaining scene, wherein Riley witnesses monkeys engaging in playful and exciting behavior on the bars. Such instances are likely to evoke feelings of joy, amusement, and delight, all of which can be encompassed within the term \\"happiness.\\" Observing the playfulness of the monkeys can not only inspire happiness in Riley due to the sheer entertainment value in the animals' antics, but also it may pique Riley's curiosity and interest in the monkeys' natural behavior and group dynamics. This engagement might further contribute to the uplifting and enjoyable experience of watching the animals in their zoo habitat. The joyful atmosphere that's often present at zoos, alongside the opportunity to learn about and interact with a variety of animals, lends itself to fostering a positive experience for visitors, reinforcing the validity of \\"happiness\\" as a likely emotion for Riley in this particular situation. It is important to note, however, that human emotions can be complex and varied, and \\"happiness\\" may not always be a one-size-fits-all answer for similar scenarios. While we can claim that happiness, in general, would be a valid answer, it is crucial to recognize the subjective nature of emotions and how individual experiences may differ. For example, some may argue that Riley's emotional response to watching the monkeys could be tempered by empathy for the animals' captivity or concern for their well-being depending on Riley's opinions on zoos. Nevertheless, within the context of the question and based on the joyful scene portrayed, \\"happiness\\" remains a valid answer to explain Riley's feelings after observing the monkeys playing on the bars at the zoo."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Quintiles supérieur / inférieur: This phrase refers to the \\"upper and lower quintiles.\\" In statistics, a quintile is a method of dividing a dataset into five equal parts, each containing 20% of the data. The upper quintile (quintile supérieur) consists of the top 20% of the data, while the lower quintile (quintile inférieur) consists of the bottom 20% of the data.

Supérieur / moyenne: This phrase means \\"upper / average.\\" The term \\"supérieur\\" signifies the upper or higher values within the dataset. In contrast, \\"moyenne\\" refers to the average or mean value of the data. The average is calculated by adding all the values in the dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of values. The given phrase appears to be related to statistical analysis, specifically referring to the concept of quintiles and the average value within a dataset.

Question: \\"Who is the most at risk for exploitation under their current rules?\\"  Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\". A former member of the church’s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, \\"which is an impossibility\\". Anderson says the policies \\"protect pedophiles rather than protect the children.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children, adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The most at risk for exploitation under Jehovah's Witnesses' current rules are the victims of sexual abuse, particularly children. The \\"two witness rule\\" makes it challenging for victims to prove their allegations, especially in situations where the abuse took place in private without another witness present. This requirement potentially enables abusers to escape from accountability and continue perpetrating abuse within the religious organization. The individuals involved in such abuse cases may also face additional obstacles under the current rules. Elders are instructed to leave the matter in Jehovah's hands if there is not sufficient evidence or corroboration to back up the allegations, distorting the process of addressing the abuse.  Moreover, the policy to educate parents and not to sponsor activities that separate children from parents may not be sufficient to prevent abuse. It is crucial to establish an appropriate reporting procedure and a supportive environment for the victims, both of which may be lacking in Jehovah's Witnesses organization due to their policies. In conclusion, the most at risk for exploitation under the current Jehovah's Witnesses rules are those who experience sexual abuse, with the mentioned policies and culture potentially providing a safe haven for abusers while hindering any necessary intervention, support, or assimilation of responsibility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound.

London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.  - Pebble Mill Studios was a television studio complex owned by the BBC located in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Marquee Moon was released on February 8, 1977, in the United States and on March 4 in the United Kingdom, where it was an unexpected success and reached number 28 on the country's albums chart. The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where \\"all our equipment was shoved up at the [Glasgow] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space.\\"By the time of Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure. Marquee Moon sold fewer than 80,000 copies in the US and failed to chart on the Billboard 200. The group was dispirited by their inability to meet...

The robotic submarine was developed by researchers at the University of Washington. It is about 1.8 meters long and weighs about 52 kilograms. It moves through water at a speed of up to 20-25 kilometers a day and can stay at sea for up to six months before needing a battery recharged. This special character results from its special propulsion system  . Unlike a traditional submarine, the Seaglider does not have a propeller  . It has an air tank that is emptied and filled to adjust   depth, as well as a pair of wings that help to guide and lead the submarine.     A traditional submarine, on the other hand, \\"puts water inside tanks to make it heavier, or it will expel   the water to make it lighter,\\" explained Frederick, a professor at the University of Washington.     Each time the Seaglider comes to the surface, it sends the data which it collects to its controllers by satellite. Operators can also send the submarine new information. For example, they can change its course in their office through giving the computer orders.     Seagliders are already being used for scientific research, such as environmental studies. iRobot also hopes to sell the submarine to the military  . At 100,000 each, the Seaglider is a cheap way to keep an eye on the ocean.     \\"These things can go out there and monitor   large areas of ocean because they're very persistent.

Hypothesis: monkey eats orange .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"When analyzing the scenario given in the premise, there are many potential elements that could exist within that scene. However, not all of them can be necessarily concluded from the premise. The premise describes the following: a man is relaxing at a park, lying down on the grass between two trees, in front of a small lake, with buildings and cars visible in the distance across the lake. The hypothesis states: a monkey eats an orange. To determine whether the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise, we must examine each element and consider whether it can be logically inferred from the information provided. In order to conclude the hypothesis as true, we must be able to establish that there is, in fact, a monkey present at the scene, and this monkey is consuming an orange. 1. Presence of a monkey: The premise does not specifically mention the presence of a monkey in the scene. While it is not impossible for a monkey to be present at a park, the scenario does not provide any information to support this claim. Parks often have various wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other small animals, but the presence of a monkey would depend on the location and type of park, which is not described in the premise. 2. Monkey eating an orange: Given that there is no mention of a monkey in the premise, there is no basis for concluding that a monkey is eating an orange. Additionally, even if we knew a monkey was present, their eating habits and specific food choices are not part of the information provided. Upon examining these two elements, we can acknowledge that the hypothesis cannot be concluded from the premise. The presence of a monkey and its consumption of an orange are not supported by the information provided in the premise.

The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder.

Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door.

As it hit the water, the car tipped toward the passenger side, hesitated, and then rolled onto its roof and sank into the river. There was no time to tell the kids what to do.

If \\"Bicyclist riding on a grass field, wearing a red and yellow uniform, shades, and a helmet.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A person rides a bicycle over a grassy field.\\"?","output":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"A person rides a bicycle over a grassy field\\" when given the initial statement, \\"Bicyclist riding on a grass field, wearing a red and yellow uniform, shades, and a helmet.\\"  Let's break down the initial statement and see how it links to the conclusion. 1. \\"Bicyclist riding on a grass field\\": This phrase clearly states that there is a bicyclist who is riding on a grass field. The term \\"bicyclist\\" directly implies that the individual is a person who is riding a bicycle. The grass field refers to the grassy field that the bicyclist is riding on. 2. \\"wearing a red and yellow uniform\\": This part of the statement describes the attire of the person riding the bicycle. The uniform color is not directly relevant to the conclusion, but it helps in painting a descriptive image of the scene. It does not change the fact that a person is riding a bicycle. 3. \\"shades\\": The term \\"shades\\" refers to sunglasses, which is another detail about the bicyclist's attire. Although not relevant to the conclusion, it adds another descriptive element to the situation. 4. \\"and a helmet\\": The use of a helmet by the bicyclist is an essential piece of information for safety reasons. Although it does not significantly impact the conclusion, it does imply that the rider is taking necessary safety precautions while riding the bicycle. Combining all these details, the conclusion \\"A person rides a bicycle over a grassy field\\" is supported by the initial statement. The statement describes a scene in which a bicyclist is riding on a grass field. The additional details about the uniform, shades, and helmet do not change the fact that a person is riding a bicycle on the grassy field but rather provides more context, visual appeal, and safety concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Electric motor: The first commutator DC electric motor capable of turning machinery was invented by the British scientist William Sturgeon in 1832. Following Sturgeon's work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor made with the intention of commercial use was built by the American inventor Thomas Davenport, which he patented in 1837. The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press. Due to the high cost of primary battery power, the motors were commercially unsuccessful and Davenport went bankrupt. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors but all encountered the same battery power cost issues. No electricity distribution had been developed at the time. Like Sturgeon's motor, there was no practical commercial market for these motors.

Write a text based on \\"merkel ahead in germany ; rivals embarrassed\\" Text:","output":"Step 1: Contextualize the information To create a text based on \\"Merkel ahead in Germany; rivals embarrassed,\\" we must first understand the context in which this information is presented. The phrase suggests that Angela Merkel, a German politician, was leading in some context, possibly an election or political poll, and has managed to leave her rivals feeling embarrassed due to her significant lead. Step 2: Research to gather more relevant details To expand on this topic and write a coherent text, we can research Angela Merkel's political career, her party's performance in recent elections or political polls, and the reactions of her rivals. This information will help us establish a timeline and context for the text. Step 3: Organize information Structure the gathered information in a logical order, beginning with a brief introduction to Angela Merkel and the specific situation in which she is ahead, followed by a mention of her rivals and their embarrassment as a result of her performance. Step 4: Create the text Title: Angela Merkel Surges Ahead in Germany, Leaving Rivals Embarrassed Angela Merkel, the former German Chancellor and leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has once again demonstrated her political prowess by taking the lead in recent polls, leaving her rivals trailing behind and feeling embarrassed. Merkel, who held the position of Chancellor for 16 years, has been admired worldwide for her leadership and commitment to the European Union. Evidently, her popularity has remained strong among German citizens despite her departure from office, as recent polls indicate a significant lead for the CDU in comparison to other major parties. This upward trend for the CDU has surely left rival parties feeling disconcerted and embarrassed. As they struggle to maintain or gain ground, the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party must reevaluate their strategies and messages to win over German voters. In conclusion, Angela Merkel's enduring popularity and the CDU's favorable position in recent polls have left rival political parties with the challenging task of finding a new approach. Faced with such a strong opponent, these parties must act quickly to avoid further embarrassment as Merkel's legacy continues to dominate Germany's political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: How do you improve your English speaking skills, so that you can communicate more easily and effectively? These tips will help you to become a more confident speaker. Practice where you can and when you can. Any practice is good--- whether you speak to someone who is a native English speaker or not. It's important to build your confidence. If possible, use simple sentence structure that you know is correct so that you can concentrate on getting your message across. Try to experiment with the English you know. Apply words and phrases you know to new situations. Native English speakers are more likely to correct you if you use the wrong word than if you use the wrong grammar. Experimenting with vocabulary is a really good way of getting feedback  Try to respond to what people say to you. You can often get clues to what people think by looking at their body language. Respond to them in a natural way. Try not to translate into and from your own language. It takes too much time and you will find it difficult to get an English answer right away. You don?t know how to do well. The more you want to act well, the more slowly you act. This will make you more shilly-shally. If you forget a word, do what native English speakers do all the time ,and say things that 'fill' the conversation. This is better than remaining completely silent. Try using ' um',or 'er',if you forget the word. Don't speak too fast! It? s important to use a natural rhythm in speaking English, but if you speak too fast it will be difficult for people to understand you. Try to relax when you speak and you,11 find that your mouth does most of the pronunciation work for you. Speak English at normal speed. Final tips --Try to become less hesitant and more confident. --Don't be shy to speak------ the more you do it, the more confident you,11 become. --Remember to be polite------ use \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" if you ask someone to do something for you.

Premise: \\"This suggests Tripp is not attempting to construct a first draft in her own words following the earlier instructions.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Tripp is using someone else's work.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, it is not definitively true that the hypothesis \\"Tripp is using someone else's work\\" is accurate. However, the premise does raise some suspicion and might serve as a starting point for further investigation. To delve deeper into this and provide a well-rounded perspective, we must first scrutinize the available information and evaluate the alternatives thoroughly.   The premise suggests that Tripp is not attempting to construct a first draft in her words, which implies she has been given instructions to create an original piece of writing. The failure to follow these instructions may indeed hint at a possibility that she could be using someone else's work. However, we should consider other possibilities as well. 1. Lack of understanding: It is possible that Tripp could have misunderstood her earlier instructions on producing a first draft in her words. She might be using other sources as a reference but unintentionally included some phrasing that might create the impression that she is using someone else's work verbatim. 2. Inexperience or difficulty with paraphrasing: Tripp might be struggling with the skills needed for paraphrasing and summarizing, leading to a perceived lack of original content in her work. She may be attempting to create her thoughts using resource materials but may not have effectively altered the original content. 3. Use of common phrases or coincidental similarity: Sometimes, the usage of certain common phrases or sentences within a topic may lead to the incorrect assumption of plagiarism. It is possible that Tripp's work bears coincidental similarity with other work in this field but is not an intentional duplication. 4. Rushed work or lack of effort: Tripp might have encountered difficulties in time management or could have procrastinated, causing her to rush and compromise the quality of her work. As a result, she might have unintentionally used someone else's work or heavily relied on existing sources, instead of creating a first draft in her words. To confirm the hypothesis, it is necessary to evaluate the draft meticulously and gather more information on Tripp's background, her writing process, and her understanding of the task assigned. Multiple factors could play a role in her work not being an original first draft apart from using someone else's work.  In summary, while the premise suggests a possibility that Tripp could be using someone else's work, we cannot conclusively prove the hypothesis based solely on this premise. It would be prudent to investigate further and consider alternative explanations for her work not being an original, first draft before reaching a conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[A]. yes; [B]. it is not possible to tell; [C]. no;","output":"[B]. It is not possible to tell The premise \\"Look for converted monasteries and countryside farmhouses\\" suggests that the speaker is recommending seeking out these locations, presumably for their historic, cultural, or aesthetic significance. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that farmhouses in the countryside are very authentic. Authenticity is a measure of truth, genuineness, or originality, and we cannot derive the authenticity of countryside farmhouses merely from this sentence. If the speaker had provided more context or evidence to support the authenticity of farmhouse properties, for example, by mentioning that they have preserved their original features, architectural design, or have been restored to maintain their historical and cultural heritage, then we could consider the hypothesis \\"The farmhouses in the countryside are very authentic\\" to be true. Since we do not have such context or evidence in the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true or false based on the information provided. Therefore, the best answer is that it is not possible to tell whether the farmhouses in the countryside are very authentic based on the given statement. It is essential to recognize that the premise refers to specific types of properties (converted monasteries and countryside farmhouses), which implies that these places could hold some interest or unique features, but this information is not enough to support the hypothesis.

Sara and her husband Peter (Martin Donovan), a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sara finds a man putting up a âFor Rentâ sign in front of a large house. The man is frustrated and offers her the first month free if she will rent it immediately. The following day, Peter arrives with Matt's brother Billy (Ty Wood) and cousins Wendy (Amanda Crew) and Mary, and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, where there is a mysterious door. After moving in, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. The next day, Peter learns that the house was supposedly a funeral home; the room behind the mysterious door is a mortuary. Matt tells another patient, Reverend Nicholas Popescu (Elias Koteas), about the visions. Nicholas advises him to find out what the spirit wants. Later, Matt finds a burned figure in his room who begins to move toward him. When the family comes home, they find a shirtless Matt with his fingers blood-covered from scratching at the wall.

Catherine V. \\"Ginny\\" Kilgore of Oxford, an attorney with North Mississippi Rural Legal Services, has been recognized for her dedication to serving the indigent. Kilgore - who oversees delivering legal services to the disabled and elderly in 39 north Mississippi counties - is recipient of the University of Mississippi School of Law's 2002 Public Service Award. The award was announced recently at a dinne r, held in Kilgore's honor and hosted by law school Dean Samuel M. Davis, who presented her with an engraved plaque. \\"Ginny Kilgore is a public servant in the truest sense,\\" said Davis. \\"Her selection continues the tradition of this award in recognizing those who have labored in the trenches, with little or no compensation but with great professional and personal satisfaction in helping to bring justice and equality to those who need it most.\\" \\"This award means a great deal to me,\\" Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. \\"The work of those who received the award before me has been so important; I feel very honored.\\" After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education and a few years teaching, Kilgore enrolled at the UM law school. Upon graduation in 1975, she entered private law practice in Oxford, joining NMRLS in 1978. Since then, she has earned promotions from managing attorney, senior attorney, then director of the Council on Aging project. Since 1990, she has worked in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development, and directed the Elder Law Project, serving the northern half of the state.

Additional complications arise when Shelly, a relative old-timer who resents the Disneyfication of Vegas, resists the efforts of new Shangri-La owner advisers, including Ivy League graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov (Ron Livingston), to update the casino hotel property and bring it into the 21st century. Lootz also learns his seldom-seen adult son is back in town, and, with his wife, is interfering with the operations at the Shangri La.

William McKinley (January 29, 1843 - September 14, 1901) was the 25th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1897 until his assassination in September 1901, six months into his second term. McKinley led the nation to victory in the Spanish-American War, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of free silver (effectively, expansionary monetary policy). McKinley was the last president to have served in the American Civil War, and the only one to have started the war as an enlisted soldier, beginning as a private in the Union Army and ending as a brevet major. William McKinley Jr. was born in 1843 in Niles, Ohio, the seventh child of William McKinley Sr. and Nancy (nee Allison) McKinley (1809-1897). The McKinleys were of English and Scots-Irish descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who was born in Dervock, County Antrim, in present-day Northern Ireland. There, the elder McKinley was born in Pine Township, Mercer County.  The family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, settling in New Lisbon (now Lisbon). He met Nancy Allison there, and married her later. The Allison family was of mostly English descent and among Pennsylvania's earliest settlers. The family trade on both sides was iron-making, and McKinley senior operated foundries throughout Ohio, in New Lisbon, Niles, Poland, and finally Canton. The McKinley household was, like many from Ohio's Western Reserve, steeped in Whiggish and abolitionist sentiment, the latter based on the family's staunch Methodist beliefs. William followed in the Methodist tradition, becoming active in the local Methodist church at the age of sixteen. He was a lifelong pious Methodist.  In 1852, the family moved from Niles to Poland, Ohio so that their children could attend the better schools there. Graduating from Poland Seminary in 1859, he enrolled the following year at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed. He also spent time at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio as a board member. Although his health recovered, family finances declined and McKinley was unable to return to Allegheny, first working as a postal clerk and later taking a job teaching at a school near Poland, Ohio. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: did he have any siblings?","output":"Yes, William McKinley Jr. had siblings.

Another wrestler climbs the ring post to the top turnbuckle and delivers a flying attack on the prone opponent. Step 3: Determine if the move requires one or more wrestlers The move is defined as a tandem move, which means it requires the cooperation of multiple wrestlers.

TV pictures of the aftermath of Tuesday's disaster showed scores of collapsed buildings in the South Island city of nearly 400,000 people.      Shocked survivors could be seen wandering the rubble-strewn streets, which cracked open as the ground beneath was liquefied by the tremor.      Police said that the dead included people on two buses which were crushed by falling buildings.      Helicopters plucked survivors to safety from rooftops, and dumped water on fires.      Officials said up to 30 people were feared still trapped inside the razed Pyne Gould Guinness building, where screams have been heard from the ruins.

Bystanders have been using bare hands to try to free survivors trapped under debris.      Many injured people were carried out on blood-soaked stretchers or in the arms of shocked workmates and strangers.      Some escaped on ropes lowered from office towers. Others managed to crawl out of the rubble.      Analysis By nature, earthquakes tend to cluster in space and time. And Tuesday's tremor in Christchurch is almost certainly related to the much more energetic event that hit the region last September. The critical difference on this occasion is the ground broke almost directly under the country's second city, and at shallow depth, 5km (3 miles) below the surface. Contrast this with September's magnitude 7 quake: its epicentre occurred some 40km west of the city and at a depth of 10km, and it continued to rupture mainly away from the major built-up areas. New Zealand lies on the notorious Ring of Fire, the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. The country straddles the boundary between two tectonic plates: the Pacific and Indo-Australian plates. On South Island, the location of the latest quake, the plates rub past each other horizontally. Depth and location key      The tremor sent the spire of Christchurch Cathedral, a landmark in the centre of the city, toppling into the square below.      John Gurr, a camera technician, told Reuters news agency the area outside the cathedral was \\"like a warzone\\".      Power and telephone lines have been knocked out, while burst pipes have deluged streets with water.      The suburbs of Lyttelton and New Brighton are reportedly \\"unliveable\\".      Queen Elizabeth II said in a statement she had been \\"utterly shocked\\" by the news.      \\"My thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this dreadful event,\\" the statement said.      The quake caused some 30m tons of ice to shear away from New Zealand's biggest glacier.      Witnesses say massive icebergs formed when the Tasman Glacier in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park broke, tossing a nearby lake with huge waves.      Back in Christchurch, emergency shelters were set up in the city's Hagley Park, a race course and schools as night approached.      City Mayor Bob Parker told the BBC: \\"This is a terrible, terrible toll on our city.\\"      \\"There is no power in most of the city; there is no water in most of the city,\\" he added.

Aftershocks      The military has been deployed to help the rescue effort, and the government has accepted an offer of specialist help from Australia.      A series of aftershocks, some as big as magnitude 5, have already rattled the stricken city, and officials warned residents to brace for more.      One Christchurch resident, Jaydn Katene, told the New Zealand Herald: \\"We've had friends in town call us and say there are just bodies lying around; lots of dead bodies outside shops just lying there just covered in bricks.\\"      A British backpacker said the city \\"looked like a bomb had hit it\\".

The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the...

Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations.

Question: What is the name of the reporter covering the assasination of the president of San Marcos? Movie title: Bananas Movie plot: Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) is the protagonist, but he does not appear until after the opening credits. The cold open, which featured the assassination of the president of the fictional \\"banana republic\\" of San Marcos and a coup d'Ã©tat that brings Gen. Emilio Molina Vargas (Carlos Montalban) to power, sets up the situation in which Mellish would become embroiled. The scene was in the form of a championship boxing telecast on Wide World of Sports, with Don Dunphy as the host and Howard Cosell as the commentator.[4] Mellish is a neurotic blue collar man who tries to impress social activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) by trying to get in touch with the revolution in San Marcos. He visits the republic and attempts to show his concern for the native people. However, he is nearly killed by the local caudillo and then saved by the revolutionaries, putting him in their debt. Mellish then learns, clumsily, how to be a revolutionary. When the revolution is successful, the Castro-style leader goes mad, forcing the rebels to place Mellish as their President. When traveling back to the U.S. to obtain financial aid, he reunites with his activist ex-girlfriend and is exposed. In a classic courtroom scene, Mellish tries to defend himself from a series of incriminating witnesses, including a reigning Miss America and a middle-aged African-American woman claiming to be J. Edgar Hoover in disguise. One of the witnesses does provide testimony favorable to Mellish, but the court clerk, when asked to read back this testimony, replies with an entirely different, wholly unfavorable rendition. Mellish is eventually sentenced to prison, but his sentence is suspended on the condition that he does not move into the judge's neighborhood. Nancy then agrees to marry him. The film ends with the between-the-covers consummation of their marriage, an event that was over much more quickly than Nancy had anticipated. Like the opening scene, it was accompanied by Cosell providing commentary.

That means he played football really well, but it wasn't his full-time job. He loved the sport and liked to play in games to show off his skills. One day, he got into a road accident, which is when cars bump into each other on the street. Now, most people who get hurt would tell the truth about their injuries, but this footballer decided to lie. He claimed that he would be injured for a whole month! He did this because he thought he would receive money to help him while he wasn't able to work or play football. Sometimes, people who get hurt in accidents get money to help them, but they should always tell the truth about their injuries. This footballer didn't tell the truth, and it caused him some problems. People found out that he wasn't really injured for a month and that he was lying. They didn't like that he lied, and they felt he was being dishonest. So, the people in charge (like the grown-ups at a school) decided to punish the footballer for lying. They didn't think it was right for him to get money for something that didn't really happen. The punishment they gave him was a suspended prison sentence. That's like being grounded, but it's more serious because it involves the law. This suspended prison sentence means that the footballer won't go to prison right now, but he must follow some rules and be very careful. If he makes a mistake or breaks the rules, he might have to go to prison after all.  In the end, the footballer learned an important lesson: always tell the truth, especially when it comes to your health and well-being. Lying can get you in trouble and can hurt the people around you. It's always better to be honest and face the consequences, just like our parents and teachers always tell us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Now, let's evaluate the provided choices to find the best answer that fits the context of the question: - afraid of: This choice seems irrelevant, as it doesn't provide any meaningful resolution or assurance to the child's situation. - part old: This choice also doesn't seem to add any value or make sense, as being \\"part old\\" doesn't seem connected with accepting the child's current state. - different: This choice does provide an acceptable context, as it suggests that everyone has their unique qualities, assuring the child that it's fine to be the way he is. - good at: This choice focuses on skills or abilities, but doesn't appear to address the broader context of accepting the child's current state. - smart: Similar to \\"good at,\\" this choice also doesn't address the context of recognizing and accepting the child's current state. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer based on the context. Based on the context of the question and the analysis of the choices, it can be concluded that \\"different\\" is the most appropriate answer. The rationale to choose \\"different\\" as the answer is that it provides a supportive and reassuring message to the child, acknowledging their unique qualities and affirming that it is okay to be the way they are, as everyone is different in their own ways."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: Information:  - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.  - A judge presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and in an open court. The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate.  - Adrian Guy Duplantier , Sr. ( March 5 , 1929 -- August 15 , 2007 ) , served from May 31 , 1978 , until his death as a judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana . He was also a former four - term Democratic member of the Louisiana State Senate , having represented Orleans Parish .  - The Louisiana State Senate (\\"French: Sénat de Louisiane\\") is the upper house of the state legislature of Louisiana. All senators serve four-year terms and are assigned multiple committees to work on. The Republicans gained control of the chamber in 2011 after a special election in District 26 brought victory to their nominee, Jonathan W. Perry. Previously the Democratic Party held a majority in the Senate. The Senate President is a Democrat-turned-Republican, John Alario from Westwego.

Write highlights for this article: A Florida town has banned people -- let's face it, young people -- from wearing saggy pants. A councilwoman for Ocala pushed for passage of the law, but the town's Mayor Kent Guinn may ultimately veto the fashion police. If the law goes into effect, it's unclear what measuring tools the Ocala Police Department would use to determine whether citizens' pants are within the 2-inch legal limit of a theoretical waistline. It's even more unclear how they will determine where the waistline actually lies on an individual. More likely than not, the Ocala PD will use the time-honored legal standard of \\"I know it when I see it\\" to eyeball the location of waistlines relative to pants lines. The not-too-subtle message is: Pull up your pants, because \\"2 inches\\" really just means \\"too annoying.\\" Why do I suggest it singles out young people? I'm not ascribing any evil motive to law enforcement. Rather, as a society, we won't expect the police to ticket a plumber crouched over at work, accidentally revealing his tighty-whiteys. We'll expect them to target teens who show underwear as a fashion statement. So, the underlying legal question arises: Can the government even outlaw saggy pants in the first place? It's true that the First Amendment prohibits the government from interfering with our speech -- which is the right to receive and disseminate ideas and information. It's also true that speech need not be spoken or written. The First Amendment also protects \\"expressive conduct.\\" The problem is that expressive conduct is hard to identify. Clothing can certainly be expressive. In 1971, the Supreme Court overturned one man's conviction for wearing a jacket that said \\"F**k the Draft\\" -- but that's not really expressive conduct, because the written words constituted speech. Expressive conduct conveys an idea without words. Wearing a black armband to school to protest a war is an example of expressive conduct, and the Supreme Court has said doing so is protected speech. Indeed, even offensive clothing, like Nazi uniforms, has been deemed expressive conduct, and the reviled Klansman robe has garnered First Amendment protections. Clothing can be communicative, but courts require an identifiable, specific message to apply First Amendment protection. Saggy pants proponents would have to show that (1) displaying your underwear conveys an identifiable message (2) that the rest of us on the street can understand as an identifiable message. Well, doesn't having one's pants on the ground convey ideas about comfort, personal style, and individuality? Certainly, but those are not specific enough \\"messages\\" for the courts. When you think about it, all clothing conveys those ideas. In the '80s, many of us were conveying strong ideas about acid wash jeans and shoulder pads, and in the '90s, our collective message was apparently flannel and work boots. But that's just style -- or lack thereof -- and it's not enough of a message to be protected speech. During the 2013 trial of George Zimmerman, many took to wearing hooded sweatshirts to show support for Trayvon Martin, who was killed by Zimmerman while wearing a hoodie. Wearing hoodies satisfies the first prong of having a particularized message, but probably fails the second. Hoodies are so popular that a court might conclude the message of solidarity is indistinguishable on the street from, say, someone wearing a hoodie to the gym. In that sense, hoodies would fail the second test, because they are not understood as speech by others. The results feel confusing: A court would likely conclude that the clothing of a Klansman or a neo-Nazi conveys a particularized message -- an unpopular, divisive, angry message. That would entitle it to constitutional protection. But saggy pants? The message is too amorphous, so it cannot be protected speech. And if it's not protected speech, the First Amendment will not prevent towns from outlawing those droopy drawers. Few of us like looking at people's skivvies when their jeans hang off them on the subway, but how offensive is it, really? Our culture's mores about clothing are fundamentally illogical. We attempt to outlaw this display of the top half of someone's boxers, but have no laws for that old guy at the pool -- usually the same guy glistening with suntan oil -- who prances around in nothing but a Speedo all summer. What's with that guy, anyway? The point is that culturally, we accept nearly complete nudity in one context, but try to regulate mostly clothed conduct in another. There really is no logic to our ideas about clothing. That helps to explain horrible fashion choices from decade to decade, but does little to logically justify clothing regulations. As much as we feel free to express ourselves with apparel, we likely have less freedom of expression than we imagined. And at least in one town in Florida, no matter how trendy your gear may be, it looks like it's time to pull up the pants.","output":"In a town in Florida, they have decided to not allow people, mostly young people, to wear saggy pants. This means pants that show their underwear too much. The law is not very clear on how they will measure if the pants are too low, but the idea is to tell young people to pull up their pants because it is annoying. The big question is if the government has the right to say what kind of clothes people can wear. The law usually protects our right to express ourselves with words and actions, which can include the clothes we wear. But the courts say that the message from the clothes has to be clear for it to count as an expression. Saggy pants might show personal style, but the message is not clear enough, so the government can make a rule about it. Some people think the rule is not fair because there are other clothes, like very small swimsuits, that show even more skin but are not against the law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cut your peaches into thin slices and place those into a saucepan on the stovetop. Add the sugar and the two cups of water (16. 65 fl oz.","output":"or 500 ml) to the saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Stir the mixture occasionally until the sugar dissolves and the peaches become soft. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the peach mixture sit for about 10 minutes, allowing the peaches to steep and the syrup to thicken slightly. While the peach syrup is steeping, brew your tea of choice. You can opt for traditional black tea, which is a classic choice for peach tea, or go for green tea or white tea if you prefer a lighter flavor. Bring approximately four cups (33.3 fl oz. or 1 liter) of water to a boil, then remove from the heat and add your tea bags or loose tea leaves. Allow the tea to steep for about 3-5 minutes, depending on your taste preferences. If you're using loose tea leaves, strain out the tea leaves after they have steeped for the desired amount of time. If you're using tea bags, simply remove the tea bags and discard them. Now it's time to combine the peach syrup and brewed tea. Carefully strain out the peach slices from the syrup and set them aside. You can either use a fine mesh strainer or a cheesecloth to strain the syrup. Slowly pour the peach syrup into the brewed tea, stirring gently as you go. Depending on your taste preferences, you can add more or less peach syrup to reach your desired level of sweetness and flavor intensity. For a slight twist, you could also add a splash of lemon or lime juice to give the peach tea a slightly tangy flavor. Serve your peach tea over ice for a refreshing, cool beverage. Fill a tall glass with ice cubes and pour the peach tea mixture over the ice. If you like, you can garnish your glass with a few of the reserved peach slices, a sprig of fresh mint, or a slice of lemon or lime. Stir well before enjoying, as the peach syrup may settle at the bottom of the glass. For an extra special treat, you can also turn your peach tea into a peach tea cocktail by adding a shot of your favorite alcohol, like vodka, rum, or bourbon. Just be sure to drink responsibly and enjoy the fruity, refreshing taste of your homemade peach tea."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The process of deducing this conclusion is as follows: 1. Understanding the Premise: The information within the premise \\"I don't know what they--unlike, say, Martin Luther King--stand for.\\" informs us that the speaker knows what Martin Luther King stood for.

Please answer the following question: Jennifer and Justin are examining the principle of chemical equilibrium in their second year organic chemistry course. They are performing a reaction that involves hydrogen gas and glucose as the starting reactants, and the products formed in the reaction are carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. Jennifer and Justin add the materials, and then wait until the reaction has reached equilibrium. Afterwards, Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture, while Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person's reaction, Jennifer's or Justin's, will begin producing more carbon dioxide?  Hint: An equilibrium can also be disrupted by the full or partial removal of a reactant or product. If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH 3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH 3 will be produced. The concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease. Continued removal of NH 3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either N 2 or H 2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored, and the concentration of NH 3 would decrease. Answer:","output":"In the given scenario, Jennifer and Justin are studying the principle of chemical equilibrium and performing a reaction with hydrogen gas and glucose as reactants. The products formed in this reaction are carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. After the reaction reaches equilibrium, Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture, while Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture. To understand which person's reaction will begin producing more carbon dioxide, we must first examine the concept of Le Chatelier's Principle. Le Chatelier's Principle states that if a change is made to the concentration of a species in an equilibrium reaction, the equilibrium will shift in a direction that counteracts the change, ultimately restoring a new equilibrium. In Jennifer's reaction, she removes glucose, which is one of the reactants. According to Le Chatelier's Principle, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that counteracts this change. In this case, the reaction will shift towards the reactants' side to replace the removed glucose. Consequently, the reaction will consume more carbon dioxide and oxygen gas to produce more hydrogen gas and glucose, leading to a decrease in carbon dioxide production. On the other hand, Justin removes carbon dioxide, which is one of the products in his reaction mixture. According to Le Chatelier's Principle, the equilibrium will shift in the direction that counteracts this change. In this case, the reaction will shift towards the products' side to replace the removed carbon dioxide. Consequently, the reaction will consume more hydrogen gas and glucose to produce more carbon dioxide and oxygen gas, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide production. Thus, based on the principle of chemical equilibrium and Le Chatelier's Principle, Justin's reaction will begin producing more carbon dioxide after he removes some carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.

However, there are some subtle differences in the way the messages are delivered, and let's break them down for better understanding. 1. \\"Yeah, I think the concept's great, you know.\\" In this sentence, the speaker uses the informal word \\"Yeah\\" to express their agreement or affirmation. The phrase \\"I think the concept's great,\\" also suggests the speaker's positive opinion regarding this matter. Ending the sentence with \\"you know\\" can either be a filler phrase or an attempt by the presenter to elicit agreement or understanding from the listener. This statement has an informal and conversational tone. 2. \\"You know, I think the idea is great.\\" This sentence begins with \\"You know,\\" which can also be interpreted as a filler phrase or an attempt at establishing a connection with the listener. The central message of the sentence is \\"I think the idea is great,\\" which mirrors the sentiment expressed in the first statement. However, this sentence uses the word \\"idea\\" instead of \\"concept,\\" although both words convey the same general meaning. The tone of this sentence appears more formal in comparison to the first, as it does not employ any informal language like \\"Yeah.\\" So, to sum up, both sentences express a positive outlook towards the concept or idea being discussed.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

Charles Moore returned to the great Pacific garbage patch and found that semi-permanent \\"plastic islands\\" were forming, with mussels, oysters and other creatures sheltering on the trashy landscapes.      The world's oceans may contain about 10 times more plastic than the most recent studies suggest.      The new figure estimates that the oceans hold more than 250,000 tons of trash, a number vastly different from a past estimate, which suggested the oceans' plastic is mysteriously disappearing.      Scientists arrived at the new number by combining visual estimates of trash volume with data collected from trawling the oceans with nets, said study co-author Markus Eriksen, director of research for the 5 Gyres Institute, an organization aiming to understand the plastic pollution in the ocean. [See Images of Garbage in the Ocean]      World of plastic      The detritus of everyday life has been pouring into the oceans for decades. Everything from plastic bags to water bottles have migrated from the coastlines, harbors and river mouths into the oceans, where gyres, or the ocean's giant conveyor belts, carry them to the most remote stretches of the seas.      About 15 years ago, scientists discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a trash-filled region of the Pacific Ocean the size of Texas. A recent excursion even found that islands of trash were forming in the garbage patch.      In the 1970s, studies suggested that about 45,000 tons of plastic littered the ocean, and the world's production of plastic has increased fivefold since then. But scientists don't agree on just how much of the world's plastic makes its way into the ocean, or how long it lasts before fish, sunlight and currents break it down and carry it into the deep ocean. In dozens of expeditions, scientists have tried to estimate this number by visual counts or by trawling the seas with nets.      But the first method is better at picking up large objects, such as buoys and fishing nets, whereas the second method may be more reliable for tiny, broken down pieces of plastic that are floating in the water column.      New model      In the new study, Eriksen said he and his colleagues looked at ocean plastic estimates from 24 expeditions to all of the world's five gyres, from Iceland to the Bay of Bengal.      The team combined both visual plastic surveys and net hauls with mathematical models for how ocean circulation would transport plastic, and compared these results based on the size categories of the plastic garbage. The new estimates suggest that about 5.25 trillion plastic particles, weighing about 269,000 tons, litter the oceans. Nearly 75 percent of that weight came from large plastic objects such as buoys, buckets and other fishing gear.      The model also suggests that ocean circulation acts like \\"giant shredders,\\" breaking down large plastics that predominate at the coastlines into smaller bits, with the tiniest pieces overrepresented in the subpolar regions, Eriksen told Live Science.      Given that much of the ocean detritus is heavy gear such as buoys or fishing nets, it's not feasible to use robots to trawl the seas and collect trash, Erikson said. Instead, an incentive program — for instance, offering a dollar per pound for fishermen to bring in plastic trash — could help people clean up the oceans on their own, he added.      Conflicting estimates      The work's main strength comes from combining a visual census with net yields, as well as separating plastics into different size classes, said Andrés Cózar, an ecologist at the University of Cadiz, in Spain, whose previous work suggested that much of the ocean plastic is disappearing.      However, relying too heavily on visual census data can be problematic, Cózar told Live Science in an email.      Most of the plastic items in the study are buoys, \\"which can swim fast with currents and winds. Diverse studies caution that the counts derived from visual census may be strongly overestimated for moving objects,\\" Cózar said.      Cózar's team also suspects that the model Eriksen used may overestimate the amount of trash in areas with relatively little trash, he added.      The new findings were published today (Dec. 10) in the journal PLOS ONE.      Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+. Follow LiveScience @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

But researchers are starting to get a better sense of the size and scope of the problem.      A study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One estimated that 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic, large and small, weighing 269,000 tons, could be found throughout the world’s oceans, even in the most remote reaches.      The ships conducting the research traveled the seas collecting small bits of plastic with nets and estimated worldwide figures from their samples using computer models. The largest source of plastic by weight comes from discarded fishing nets and buoys, said Marcus Eriksen, the leader of the effort and co-founder of the 5 Gyres Institute, a nonprofit group that combines scientific research with antipollution activism.      Dr. Eriksen suggested that an international program that paid fishing vessels for reclaimed nets could help address that issue. But that would do nothing to solve the problem of bottles, toothbrushes, bags, toys and other debris that float across the seas and gather at “gyres” where currents converge. The pieces of garbage collide against one another because of the currents and wave action, and sunlight makes them brittle, turning these floating junkyards into “shredders,” he said, producing smaller and smaller bits of plastic that spread far and wide.      When the survey teams looked for plastics floating in the water that were the size of grains of sand, however, they were surprised to find far fewer samples than expected — one-hundredth as many particles as their models predicted. That, Dr. Eriksen said, suggests that the smaller bits may be swept deeper into the sea or consumed by marine organisms.      The result echoed that of a paper published this year in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that found a surprisingly low amount of small plastic debris. Those researchers estimated as much as 35,000 tons of the smaller debris were spread across the world’s oceans, but they had expected to find millions of tons.      Andrés Cózar, a researcher from the University of Cadiz who headed that study, said in an email that he and Dr. Eriksen came to different conclusions about the amount of plastic afloat, but that “it is evident that there is too much plastic in the ocean,” adding, “The current model of management of plastic materials is (economically and ecologically) unsustainable.”      The fact that the small plastics are disappearing is hardly good news. In fact, it could be far more troubling than the unsightly mess the plastics cause. Plastics attract and become coated with toxic substances like PCBs and other pollutants. Researchers are concerned that fish and other organisms that consume the plastics could reabsorb the toxic substances and pass them along to other predators when they are eaten.      “Plastics are like a cocktail of contaminants floating around in the aquatic habitat,” said Chelsea M. Rochman, a marine ecologist at the University of California, Davis. “These contaminants may be magnifying up the food chain.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The ocean studies make an important contribution to the understanding of the floating waste problem, said Nancy Wallace, director of the marine debris program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.      Further research should look beyond the surface to test where the smaller plastic bits might have gone: into the deeper ocean depths, along the shoreline or settled on the seafloor. “It’s premature to say there is less plastic in the ocean than we thought,” she said. “There may just be less where we’re looking.”      Dr. Eriksen said the scope of the problem makes floating garbage collection impractical. His group has had some success with campaigns to get manufacturers of health and beauty aids to stop using small scrubbing beads of plastic in their products.      Manufacturers of other products, he said, must be urged to change their practices as well. “We’ve got to put some onus on producers,” he said. “If you make it, take it back, or make sure the ocean can deal with it in an environmentally harmless way.”      Dr. Wallace agreed. “Unless we can stop the flow — turn off the tap of these pieces of debris going into the ocean all the time — we’re not going to be able to stop the problem.”      The American Chemistry Council, which speaks for the plastics industries, issued a statement saying that its members “wholeheartedly agree that littered plastics of any kind do not belong in the marine environment,” and it cited industry efforts to combat the problem, including the 2011 Declaration of the Global Plastics Associations for Solutions on Marine Litter, which has led to 185 projects around the world. |||||       A beach in the Azores. Credit: Marcus Eriksen.      A major new study of the world's oceans has reached a shocking conclusion: Thanks to humans, there are now over 5 trillion pieces of plastic, weighing more than 250,000 tons, floating in water around the world.      With a global population of about 7.2 billion, that's nearly 700 pieces per person.      The study, published in the journal PLOS One by Marcus Eriksen of the Five Gyres Institute in Los Angeles and a large group of colleagues, is based on data from 24 separate ocean expeditions, conducted between 2007 and 2013, to sample plastic pollution. Plastic was either observed from boats, or hauled up from the ocean by nets, in 1,571 locations. The data were then used to run an ocean model to simulate the amount and distribution of plastic debris.      The result not only yielded the estimate of over 5 trillion pieces of plastic in the global ocean -- it also cast light on how plastic changes within the ocean (breaking down into smaller pieces) and circulates around the globe. Pieces between 1 millimeter and 4.75 millimeters in size were by far the most prevalent class of plastic in the ocean. However, by weight, really large pieces of plastic, greater than 200 millimeters in size, were the most significant.      \\"What we are witnessing in the global ocean is a growing threat of toxin-laden microplastics cycling through the entire marine ecosystem,\\" commented lead study author Eriksen of the Five Gyres Institute.            A sampling of plastic found in the South Atlantic gyre. Credit: Jody Lemmon.      Worryingly, even though there are far fewer people living in the Southern Hemisphere, the research found that its oceans have about the same amount of plastic, suggesting that winds and ocean currents may transport our trash all around the world.      The authors stress that they suspect their estimate is \\"highly conservative\\" -- there could be a lot more plastic out there than that. For as they note, there is also a \\"potentially massive amount of plastic present on shorelines, on the seabed, suspended in the water column, and within organisms.\\"      In particular, the authors cite a figure from the trade group Plastics Europe, which suggests that 288 million tons of plastic are produced annually. Compared to a figure like this, the 250,ooo tons described in this study represent \\"only 0.1 % of the world annual production\\" -- again underscoring that the numbers reported in the study, large though they are, are probably a low end estimate.      In response to the new study, the American Chemistry Council, which represents U.S. plastic makers, issued a statement that highlighted the importance of recycling plastics, and that pointed to a 2011 worldwide industry statement pledging to work to reduce marine litter.      “America’s plastics makers wholeheartedly agree that littered plastics of any kind do not belong in the marine environment,\\" the American Chemistry Council statement read in part. It later continued: \\"Even after plastics have fulfilled their initial purpose, these materials should be treated as valuable resources and recycled whenever possible or recovered for their energy value when they cannot.\\"      Plastic gets into the oceans because we use it and then throw it away (properly or otherwise). For that vast majority of us, that's where our relationship with plastic ends -- we don't see what happens next. How does it end up in the oceans? Most simply, plastic bags might literally blow there. Some plastic gets deliberately dumped there. And then there's runoff: Plastic on land can wind up in the water, or flow into the oceans from rivers emptying to them.      Once in the oceans, plastic plastic breaks into smaller pieces and circulates -- traveling into five major ocean gyres, which spiral in large circles, winding the trash inward. Most famously, some of it accumulates in great Pacific ocean \\"garbage patches,\\" which have particularly high plastic concentrations (however, this does not necessarily mean you will see a huge heap of trash floating on the ocean surface).      The ecological consequences ocean plastic pollution are severe -- many marine animals may not only get entangled in plastic, but may ingest this long-lasting material, thinking it is food. That's not only bad for fish, it could ultimately be bad for us. If we consume fish that have consumed plastic, then it is possible that we may ultimately end up eating plastic (or its chemical remnants) too.      So after we throw our plastic objects away, maybe we're not really done with them after all.      So what should you do? \\"It is imperative that the use of plastics include a 100% recovery plan, or choose 100% environmental harmlessness in your choice of material,\\" says Eriksen. \\"The status quo,\\" he adds, \\"is no longer acceptable.\\" ||||| Are \\"compostable\\" and “biodegradable” plant-based plastics the next generation of greenwashing?

Translate this to English?","output":"We must also reduce the segmentation of the labor market. The phrase \\"Nous devons aussi réduire la segmentation du marché du travail\\" is in French, and when translated to English, it means \\"We must also reduce the segmentation of the labor market.\\" This statement suggests that there is a need for efforts to be made in order to decrease the division and separation within the labor market. The segmentation of the labor market refers to the existence of distinct submarkets or segments within the overall labor market. These segments can be defined based on various criteria, such as the type of work, industry, skill level, or contract type. Labor market segmentation can have negative effects on workers, businesses, and the economy as a whole. For workers, labor market segmentation can lead to inequality in terms of wages, job stability, and working conditions. Some workers may be trapped in low-paying, low-skilled jobs with poor conditions, while others have access to higher-paying, high-skilled jobs with better working environments. This inequality can contribute to social tensions and reduce social mobility. For businesses, segmented labor markets can create inefficiencies and hinder growth. Companies operating in highly segmented markets may have difficulty finding and retaining the right talent, and they may also face increased costs associated with high employee turnover. Segmentation can also limit the transfer of knowledge and skills across different parts of the labor market, which can slow down innovation and productivity growth. For the economy as a whole, labor market segmentation can contribute to income inequality and slow economic growth. When workers are not able to move freely between segments, it can result in an inefficient allocation of human capital, and the economy may not be able to reach its full potential. To reduce labor market segmentation, various policy measures can be considered: 1. Improve access to quality education and training: Ensuring that all workers, regardless of their background, have access to quality education and training opportunities can help reduce segmentation, as it allows individuals to develop the skills needed for different types of jobs. 2. Promote fair hiring practices: Encouraging companies to implement fair and transparent hiring practices can reduce discrimination and help ensure that all workers have equal opportunities to be hired and advance in their careers. 3. Encourage flexible employment contracts: Offering various forms of contract types such as part-time, temporary, and permanent contracts, can create more adaptable labor markets and reduce segmentation. 4. Strengthen social protection systems: Providing strong social protection systems, including unemployment benefits and job search assistance, can help workers transition between different types of jobs and reduce the negative consequences of labor market segmentation. 5. Facilitate labor market mobility: Removing barriers to labor market mobility, such as differences in regulations, licensing requirements, and recognition of qualifications, can make it easier for workers to move between different sectors and types of jobs. Reducing labor market segmentation is a complex and multifaceted challenge, which requires both short-term and long-term interventions, as well as effective coordination among different stakeholders, including governments, businesses, and workers themselves. By addressing this issue, we can create more inclusive, efficient, and dynamic labor markets that benefit all members of society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the man that resupplied the depot that was reached on February 23rd by the group that aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days? is inside the article: The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \\"Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\\". Wild's laconic comment was \\"Good old Joyce\\".Their food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut..., can you guess it ?

Movie title: Puss in Boots Context: Sometime before Puss (Antonio Banderas) meets Shrek and Donkey in Shrek 2, he arrives at a town while escaping a bounty hunter. There he learns that the outlaw couple Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris) have the magic beans he's been looking for most of his life, beans that can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a masked cat (Salma Hayek) interrupts. Both fail and escape, and Puss follows the cat back to Cat Cantina, a club, where they have a dance-off and a sword fight, ending when Puss hits the masked cat in the head with a guitar. He learns that the masked cat is Kitty Softpaws, and is shocked to learn she is a girl. She is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a crime. It turned out that Kitty was sleeping through the story. Humpty attempts to convince Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs, which he does.The trio steals the beans from Jack and Jill and elude the angry outlaws in a canyon chase. As Humpty leads his compatriots to the spot where they must plant the beans, Puss and Kitty's relationship begins to grow from rivalry into friendship.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Puss in Boots,\\" the magic beans are initially in possession of the outlaw couple Jack and Jill, played by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris. These beans have been sought after by Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas, for most of his life, as they can lead to a giant's castle that holds valuable golden goose eggs. During the course of the film, Puss attempts to steal the magic beans from Jack and Jill, but his efforts are interrupted by a masked cat, later revealed to be Kitty Softpaws, played by Salma Hayek. Kitty Softpaws, along with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, voiced by Zach Galifianakis, convinces Puss to join them in their quest to retrieve the golden eggs using the magic beans. The trio manages to steal the beans from Jack and Jill and plants them at a designated location.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the name of the person who was not seen as a viable heir to the monarchy?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Pedro I's successor in Brazil was his five-year-old son, Pedro II. As the latter was still a minor, a weak regency was created. The power vacuum resulting from the absence of a ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II, once he was declared of age, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under Pedro II's rule, and the Empire prevailed in several other international disputes and outbreaks of domestic strife. With prosperity and economic development came an influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888. Brazilian visual arts, literature and theater developed during this time of progress. Although heavily influenced by European styles that ranged from Neoclassicism to Romanticism, each concept was adapted to create a culture that was uniquely Brazilian. Even though the last four decades of Pedro II's reign were marked by continuous internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither Pedro II nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic.","output":"In the given context, Princess Isabel was the person who was not seen as a viable heir to the Brazilian monarchy. Pedro II, the ruling monarch, had no desire for the monarchy to survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution.

It's a feature-rich app with an intuitive design and highly capable functionality. While there's certainly room for improvement, all things considered, I feel comfortable awarding this app a well-deserved 4-star rating. Let's dive into the details and explore what makes com.nilhcem.hostseditor a valuable addition to your app arsenal. Starting with the aesthetics of the app, I found the layout and user interface to be one of the most appealing aspects of using this software. It's clean, polished, and easy to navigate, making the entire user experience quite enjoyable. The design of the application follows material design guidelines and is optimized for both smartphones and tablets, granting it a look and feel that is consistent with other Android apps. Functionality-wise, the app shines even brighter. Com.nilhcem.hostseditor enables you to modify and manage the hosts file on your Android device with ease, making it immensely useful for blocking ads, redirecting websites, and even testing locally hosted applications. In addition, the app offers valuable features, such as the ability to add, edit, and delete entries, backup and restore capabilities, and an efficient search function, thus catering to various user needs. The app also does a great job of simplifying the more tedious parts of hosts file management. With its smart suggestions, it eases the process of adding new entries, and its syntax highlighting ensures that even those with little technical know-how can quickly discern errors in their entries. The inclusion of easy-to-access help documentation is another convenient feature, making it a breeze for new users to get up and running. While this app adequately delivers on its promise, there are certain aspects where it falls just short of perfection, hence the 4-star rating. First and foremost is the matter of app permissions. Although gaining root access is a necessary requirement for hosts file modification, some users may understandably be apprehensive about granting such powerful permissions to an app. As a result, increased transparency about the app’s usage of permissions and better communication of its security protocols will significantly improve user trust. Another area that could use some improvement is the occasional slow response time when handling large hosts files. In rare instances, I experienced the app lagging during the loading and saving process for sizable hosts files. Further optimization of app resources would go a long way toward preventing this issue, and it's something I'd like to see addressed in future updates. All in all, the com.nilhcem.hostseditor app is a highly functional, user-friendly solution for managing and editing the hosts file on your Android device. The app's visual appeal and rich features do a fantastic job of simplifying an otherwise complex task, while the areas that could use improvement are minor concerns compared to the overall value the app provides. I wholeheartedly recommend giving com.nilhcem.hostseditor a try, and with a few tweaks and upgrades, it could easily achieve that perfect 5-star rating."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies.  I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring gulfs had different geographical features. South gulf has shallow water and is wider, while North gulf is quite deep. Both gulfs are exposed to intense wave activity throughout the year.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom? The answer to this question is:","output":"The North gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom. The reason for this is that wave energy is primarily responsible for the majority of coastal erosion, and the characteristics of waves change as they interact with the ocean bottom. In the South gulf, which has shallow water, the waves begin to be affected by the ocean bottom sooner than in the North gulf. As waves travel into these shallow areas, the water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position, which leads to wave breaking and increased erosion of the ocean bottom. On the other hand, the North gulf, which is deeper, allows waves to travel without being disrupted by the ocean bottom. As a result, the waves maintain their energy farther into the gulf without breaking, thus reducing their erosive impact on the ocean bottom. In summary, due to the influence of wave energy and how waves interact with the ocean bottom differently in shallow vs deep water, the North gulf with its deeper waters will experience less erosion on the ocean bottom as compared to the South gulf with its shallow waters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Barbara Hannigan caught the new-music bug when she was 17. Having grown up in a village in Nova Scotia — where, she tells a Boston reporter, everyone was “a BoSox fan” — she moved to Toronto, where she attended the Etobicoke School of the Arts. She’d already been singing for many years, but it was now clear that she had the capacity to become a full-fledged artist. She credits her singing teacher and mentor, Mary Morrison, with encouraging her to open herself to as much music as she could, hearing concerts and investigating scores that went beyond the Mozart and bel canto repertoire she was studying. During that heady year, Hannigan discovered Mahler, Bruckner, and Stravinsky at the same time as Ligeti and Boulez. “I didn’t differentiate between the tradition and modern music,” Hannigan said by phone last week from Toronto. “For me, everything was just so fresh in my ears.” Hannigan did her first world premiere that year — a song cycle written for her graduation recital by a young composer — and never looked back. To date, she’s given the first performances of more than 80 works, including such recent operatic landmarks as Louis Andriessen’s “Writing to Vermeer” and George Benjamin’s “Written on Skin.” The most recent work she has midwifed is “let me tell you,” an orchestral song cycle by the Danish composer Hans Abrahamsen that recently won the prestigious Grawemeyer Award in Musical Composition. She gave the first performance with Andris Nelsons and the Berlin Philharmonic in 2013; this week, she brings the piece to the Boston Symphony Orchestra. It’s not that Hannigan isn’t interested in other music – she’s done a healthy amount of baroque and classical fare, for which her agile voice is well-suited. But, she said, “as the time went on, I noticed that other singers didn’t have this passion for modern music that I had. And I realized, hey, I’m the only one raising my hand for this chance. This is something special, and I need to honor it.” So immersive was her early involvement in the avant-garde that she calls Ligeti, Boulez, Dutilleux, and Stockhausen “my singing teachers. I was developing colors that I probably would have been too scared to develop in Mozart or Handel. So basically they developed my sound.” Hannigan has also developed a remarkable career as a conductor. She made her podium debut in 2011 after an executive at the urging of an executive at the Orchestre de Radio France who’d seen her preparation and rehearsals. She is now highly sought after for programs in which she fulfills both roles simultaneously, and she knows that conducting is an aspect of her career “which I can carry through for many years beyond my singing career.” Among the works on her conducting debut was Ligeti’s “Mysteries of the Macabre,” an excerpt from his opera “Le Grand Macabre” in which the singer plays a police chief so disoriented and divorced from reality that he can only speak in code. Phenomenally difficult and highly expressive, it has become one of her signature works since she first sang it in 2000. A YouTube clip of her performing it with Simon Rattle, with Hannigan dressed as a sort of naughty schoolgirl, shows the ferocious dramatic intensity she brings to the piece. For the last few years Rattle has been the only conductor other than herself with whom she would perform the piece. She seems to be easing it out of her repertoire, confident that her mark on “Macabre” is well-documented. “Never say never,” she said. But “it’s so powerful that it keeps all the attention, and no one remembers anything else you did on the program.” As for the Abrahamsen, it originated as a birthday present for the librettist, music writer Paul Griffiths, a close friend of Hannigan’s. Griffiths’s wife proposed having Hannigan sing at a party for “a significant birthday” of his. Hannigan was unavailable, but proposed commissioning a new work instead. Abrahamsen was the natural choice, as both she and the Griffiths admired his music. The idea blossomed into a song cycle based on Griffiths’s “let me tell you,” a stream-of-consciousness novella written from the viewpoint of Shakespeare’s Ophelia, using only the 481 words she speaks in “Hamlet.” “It was all done in friendship among the creatives,” Hannigan said proudly. “It wasn’t done with agents or anything. It was a beautiful, beautiful project among friends.” The music — a recording has just been released on the Winter & Winter label — is sensuous and exquisite. Though there are tonal signposts in the harmony, their reconfiguring is so innovative that the piece feels simultaneously foreign and deeply familiar — or, as a conductor who heard the premiere told Hannigan, “it’s as if this piece has always been there.” She estimated that she’s now sung it about 25 times. The BSO will be the 11th orchestra to accompany her. Asked what it was like to be onstage with the piece, she said “it feels like I’m witnessing Ophelia’s experience on Feb. 4, 2016, or whenever. I feel like I, Barbara Hannigan, along with this orchestra and this conductor — [we’re] the ones who have to come forward, and for everyone in the hall, I am the channel to witness her experience.” Barbara Hannigan with the Boston Symphony Orchestra At Symphony Hall, Thursday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Friday at 1:30 p.m. Tickets: 30-119. 888-266-1200, www.bso.org Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Barbara Hannigan: From New-Music Discovery to Orchestral Song Cycle Success\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The sentence in English would be: \\"People who have flu-like symptoms should also avoid any contact, to minimize the risks of mixing human influenza and avian influenza viruses.\\" This French sentence provides advice, likely from a health standpoint, on the necessary precautions one should take to minimize the risk of a possible combination of human and bird flu viruses. Influenza is a viral disease that is easily transmitted and can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. It's caused by influenza viruses that infect the lungs, throat and nose, which can cause moderate respiratory illness to severe complications.  The ‘flu-like’ symptoms generally include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headaches, chills and fatigue. Additionally, avian influenza, or bird flu, is caused by a type of influenza virus that is hosted by birds, but may infect several species of mammals.  The term \\"mixing\\" of viruses refers to the situation where two different strains of influenza - in this case, human and avian - infect the same cell and exchange genetic material. This can result in a new subtype of virus, possibly one that could more easily infect humans and spread from person to person.  Because the human immune system would have no pre-existing immunity to this new strain, it could result in a global outbreak of a new type of flu. This is why there are warnings such as these to avoid contact when someone presents flu-like symptoms; especially in communities where there's been a confirmed case of avian influenza in birds, due to the risk it could mix with human influenza viruses and potentially become more virulent."},{"instruction":"Question: Dialogue:  W: ABC company.

As long as you don’t get into the friend zone, this will show that you’re taking a real interest in him. Ask him questions about his life, share his interests, and just spend some time around him, whether you’re working on a group project or hanging out with friends. Just make sure he doesn’t see you as a kid sister or one of the guys, and don’t fall into the role of the person who hears about his romantic troubles.  Becoming his friend will show him that you want to get closer to him. This can be a great way to show him you like him, especially if you don’t have many other guy friends. It also helps you get to know the guy before jumping head-first into a relationship. Often, crushes can come about on a whim, and our actions can be impulsive. Friendship is a great way to test yourself to see if you are committed before a relationship blossoms. Take it slow. If you don’t know him very well, start with a simple conversation and work your way up to hanging out. If you want to tell your crush you like him, then you should show him that you’re comfortable being yourself around him. If you find yourself bragging, talking about how great you are, telling exaggerated stories for laughs, or just doing something that doesn’t feel like you, then this won’t win your crush over. He’ll be more likely to think you have a real interest in him if you’re being yourself, opening up, and talking about your interests or your friends. Remember that, in the end, you want a guy who likes you for who you are. You don’t want him to like you for being someone else, because that will make it hard to start a real relationship while staying true to who you are. A small gift can be a simple way to show your crush that you like him without coming on too strong. Simply get him something he’s mentioned or something you think he would like, such as a book or a CD. You can also be silly and get him something more practical, like a pack of pencils because you noticed that he never remembers to bring a pencil to class. You can write him a short note along with the gift and give it to him in person or leave it on his desk. Of course, this works best if you know him and are already friends; if you’ve never met, then giving him a gift may overwhelm him a little. One way to tell your crush you like him is to show a genuine interest in him. To do this, you should simply ask him questions about his life and make an effort to really listen to the answers instead of planning your next move. Ask him about his weekend plans, his favorite sports teams, his school activities, his friends, or his favorite bands or movie stars to get a conversation going; this will show that you care about him as a person, and that you may have a little crush on him as well.  You can also ask him about his pets, his favorite movies, or his favorite things to do for fun. Just make sure not to ask too many personal questions at first or he may get uncomfortable. Make sure to share stuff about yourself too; you don’t want to sound like you’re interrogating him. Your crush will start to see that you like him if you start teasing him a bit. You don’t need to lay it on too thick to get the message across; just playfully tease him about his new haircut, his favorite sports team (especially if the team keeps losing), his obsession with his favorite band, or other things you know he won’t take too personally. This shows that you like him enough to engage him in a fun, lighthearted conversation.  Just make sure he knows you’re teasing and that he takes it well. He may be too sensitive about his favorite sports team, for example, to think there’s anything funny about the fact that they keep losing. Let him see that you don’t tease just anybody. If he thinks that you tease all of his friends, too, then he won’t see that he’s special to you. Your crush will suspect that you like him if you start helping him out. You don’t need to go too far out of your way to help him, but making just a few small gestures can show him that you really do have a special interest in him. This can mean picking up his homework for him when he’s home sick, letting him borrow a textbook, or answering some questions that he may have. This can be a great way to show him you care as long as he doesn’t take advantage of you.  Ideally, he should find a way to help you out, too. You don’t want him to think that you’ll just be there at his beck and call. Look for ways that you can help him; he may be too shy to do something like ask for him with the math homework, but you can offer to do it and see what he says. . Flirting will definitely let your crush know that you’re into him. To flirt with him, you just have to tease him a bit, be playful, and show a special interest in him over all of the other guys in the room. You can play a little bit hard to get while letting him see that you do like him by smiling at him, laughing at his jokes, and going out of your way to make him see that you want to spend more time with him.  Flirting can be a little tricky to master, but it basically means not taking yourself too seriously while you chat about lighthearted topics with your crush, letting him see that you want to know what he has to say while also teasing him a little bit. You can lick your lips or play with your hair a bit while you talk to your crush to be a bit more playful. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: To show a guy you like him, try to be his friend and take an interest in his life. Avoid getting into the friend zone and be genuine around him, showing your true self. A small gift can signal your interest, while engaging in conversation and asking questions about his life can help him see you're genuinely interested in him. Playful teasing and offering help can also demonstrate your affection. Flirting, being playful, and showing interest in him over other guys will further communicate your feelings towards him.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you don't have a grill or don't want to deal with the hassle of using one, fear not — brisket can also be cooked in the oven as long as you use the same long, slow style of cooking. One important change that you'll want to make, however, is to use a cut of brisket that has had most or all of the fat cut from it. Brisket is often sold with a fairly thick natural fat cap. On the grill, this fat isn't as big of a problem because it can run off of the meat as it cooks. When you're cooking brisket in a pan in the oven, however, this fat will collect in the pan, leaving you with an oily mess as your final dish. If you're not confident in your fat-trimming ability, try asking your butcher to trim the fat from your meat for you before packing it up for you. In this recipe, we'll use a liquid marinade (rather than a dry rub) to flavor our meat. A marinade is simply a liquid mixture of ingredients that the meat is soaked in before cooking to give it extra flavor. You can mix ingredients in the recipe listed above if you'd like or make your own. If you do make your own, as a general rule, you'll usually want to use liquid bases that include a fat or oil and an acid. For instance, while we've used olive oil and apple cider vinegar above, you could also use lemon juice, red wine vinegar, and so on as your acid to modify the flavor of your marinade. For most brisket, you'll want to let your meat marinate for about a day. Thick, tough, heavy pieces of meat like brisket need time to fully absorb the flavor of the marinade. After your brisket has marinated, put it in an oven-safe pan and pop it in the oven. Cover the pan with foil so the meat retains its moisture. As with grilling, you'll want to use slow, low heat here. Many oven-grilling recipes use a heat of around 275o F — lower or higher is also possible, but will lead to longer or shorter cooking times, respectively. Be patient as you cook your brisket. For moderate-to-large pieces of meat, expect at least a six-to-eight hour cooking time. As your brisket cooks, check on it occasionally to monitor its progress and ensure that it's cooking at a good pace. After about three or four hours, check on your brisket. It should be browning nicely and should have produced a sort of natural liquid \\"gravy\\" in the pan. Carefully pull the pan out of the oven and turn the brisket over, then put it back in the oven. Though it's not necessarily necessary to do this to have the meat cook thoroughly, this will help ensure that the entire exterior of the piece of meat gets a satisfying \\"bark\\" or crust. Depending on your cooking temperature and the size of your meat, after about six to eight hours (or longer), your brisket should have a dark brown-to-black exterior and should be quite tender all the way through.Carefully remove the brisket from the oven, remove from its pan, and set it on a cutting board for about 10 to 15 minutes. After this, simply use a knife or a set of forks to slice or pull the meat apart and serve! Try using a spoon or ladle to pour some of the liquid from the cooking pan on the meat as a sauce or gravy. This makes an especially great addition to sandwiches. Summary:","output":"The article provides a detailed guide on how to cook brisket in the oven using a liquid marinade, discussing the importance of trimming the fat, marinating the meat, cooking at a low temperature, and periodically checking and turning the meat for optimal results and flavor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

Which rock band was formed first, Mazzy Star or A Perfect Circle? Answer:","output":"To accurately answer the question of which rock band was formed first, Mazzy Star or A Perfect Circle, it is essential to look at the formation years of the two bands. Mazzy Star is an alternative rock band that was formed in Santa Monica, California. The band's formation can be traced back to 1989 when guitarist David Roback, previously a member of bands Rain Parade and Opal, and vocalist Hope Sandoval, a former member of the folk band Going Home, joined forces to create Mazzy Star. Under this new moniker, they released their first album, \\"She Hangs Brightly,\\" in 1990. Their unique, ethereal sound resonated with early-'90s music fans, and they went on to release several more successful albums over the next decades, including the critically acclaimed \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\" in 1993. A Perfect Circle, on the other hand, is an American rock supergroup formed by guitarist Billy Howerdel and Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan. The band was established in 1999, with its first live performance occurring in August of that year. Howerdel, who had worked as a guitar tech for bands like Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins, and Tool, initially sought a female vocalist for his new project. However, upon playing his demos for Keenan, the Tool vocalist expressed interest in singing for the band. Thus, A Perfect Circle came to be as this new collaborative project. Their debut album, \\"Mer de Noms,\\" was released in 2000 and garnered considerable commercial success. Based on the formation histories, Mazzy Star was formed in 1989, while A Perfect Circle was formed a decade later in 1999. Consequently, Mazzy Star was the rock band formed first between the two."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have this math problem, and we need to find out what is the value of letter \\"b\\". Here's the problem: -575 * b - 89325 = -64025 First, let's get rid of the big number (89325) on one side, we'll add that number to both sides. So it will look like this: -575 * b = -64025 + 89325 Now, let's add the numbers on the right side: -575 * b = 25300 To find the value of b, we will divide both sides by the number in front of b, which is -575: b = 25300 / -575 If we divide 25300 by -575, we will get the value of b: b = -44 So, the solution is b = -44.

Plot: Set in the late 1980s, the story revolves around the highly competitive world of international table tennis and its two reigning champions, South Korean player Hyun Jung Hwa (Hyun) and North Korean player Li Bun Hui (Li).  As the story begins, we see the rivalry between Hyun and Li culminate at the 1989 World Table Tennis Championships, where they both lose to their unknown yet exceptional Chinese opponent, Deng Yao Liang. Deng, a quiet, mysterious, and intensely focused athlete, becomes the talk of the tournament. Hyun and Li, fierce rivals filled with national pride and political tension, are both humiliated and stunned by their crushing losses to Deng. But when news arrives that the following World Championships will remove the singles competition in favor of doubles, an unusual opportunity presents itself. Fueled by their desire to take down Deng, both North and South Korean governments begrudgingly agree to form a unified Korean table tennis team. Hyun and Li are now paired together and must set aside their deep-rooted rivalry and differences to form a formidable partnership. Their collaboration is anything but smooth, as they struggle to communicate and trust one another on and off the court. Meanwhile, Deng silently looms in the background, diligently honing his skills. As the time passes, Hyun and Li learn about each other's lives, hardships, and dreams, pulling them closer together, transforming their rivalry into a deep friendship. They then discover that Deng's past is shrouded in secrecy - a victim of China's One Child Policy, Deng was taken from his birth family as an infant and raised in an institution designed to create Olympic champions with no regard for personal happiness. Moved by Deng's story and determined to defeat him for their pride, the pair begin to devise a new strategy that melds their unique playing styles seamlessly. Their hard work pays off - during the climactic last match of the championships, they work together flawlessly and eventually manage to overpower Deng in a suspenseful, nail-biting finale. In the end, although victorious, Hyun and Li acknowledge the personal sacrifices Deng made for his country. The two offer him the opportunity for friendship, which he hesitantly accepts, hinting at a brighter future for the three athletes.

Also in translations four lines is more appropriate for the colloquialism of the language and is closest to natural conversational rhythm, necessary to carry the weight of the hokku Is it true that can a haiku have more than 3 lines?","output":"To answer this question, let us first examine what a traditional haiku is and how it is structured: 1. A traditional Japanese haiku consists of three lines. 2. It follows a syllable pattern of 5-7-5 (a total of 17 on, or traditional Japanese phonetic units). With this in mind, let us consider the information provided about Japanese poetry translations: 1. Some translators believe that 12 English syllables approximate the duration of 17 Japanese on, which suggests a potential difference in the structure when translated to English to preserve the original rhythm and meaning. 2. It is mentioned that using four lines in translations better represents the natural conversational rhythm and colloquialism of the Japanese language. Based on these points, it seems that while traditional Japanese haiku are indeed structured as three lines with a specific syllable count, it is plausible that translators may choose to use a modified format (such as 4 lines) in English translations to better convey the original intent and rhythm of the poem. This modification, however, is specific to translations and does not indicate that a traditional haiku in Japanese would have more than three lines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Game of Thrones' Maisie Williams: 'It's not all fun and games' ‘I know my looks are kind of weird – compared to other actors my age – but they work for me.” Game of Thrones’s Maisie Williams furrows her Brooke Shields eyebrows. Somehow we’ve landed on her appearance – those pale, pointed features, those large grey eyes. “I might not be a classically beautiful leading lady,” she says, “but that means I’ll play a different sort of leading lady. Does it get to me? Sometimes, but honestly I’m very confident about the future.” Williams was just 12 when she shot to fame in the fantasy behemoth playing tom boy turned teen assassin Arya Stark. She is now 19 and Game of Thrones is probably the biggest drama on TV, with an army of devoted fans who think nothing of waking in the early hours to catch up on the latest backstabbings and betrayals in the war-torn kingdom of Westeros. Over five seasons, Arya has lost most of her family, pretended to be a boy to survive, taken to reciting the list of people she wishes to revenge-kill as a bedtime prayer – and been blinded by her assassin mentor, the mysterious Jaqen H’ghar. Both the actor and the character have had to grow up fast. She is still over-excited about the programme that made her name. “I go round to my mum’s to watch the episodes with her, you know, catch up, hang out,” she says. “I’m such a huge fan despite the fact it’s a show I’m in. It’s ridiculous.” Conversely, her portrayal of Arya, a kick-ass character as endearing as she is fierce, made her a firm fan favourite from the start, with Williams singled out for the way she held her own with more experienced actors such as Charles Dance and Sean Bean. She readily admits, though, that she found the show’s success initially hard to grasp. “The thing I was really obsessed about was whether I would earn enough money to buy myself a laptop. My step-dad Gary just looked at me and said: ‘I think there’ll be enough for a couple of laptops Maisie …’” She laughs. “Suddenly I could pay for my own dancing lessons and school trips, all those things my mum had always paid for. I was able to help out.” She grew up in Bristol, the youngest of four. Her mother, Hilary, was a university course administrator who gave up her job to support her daughter on set. She has been outspoken about being bullied online when she was 13. But what really angered her were the newspaper articles attacking her family for letting her drop out of school ahead of her GCSEs to focus on the show, which has a famously punishing set schedule lasting nine months of the year. She has yet to sit any exams, though she has spent time studying dance at a performing arts college in Bath. “You can say what you want about me but I never got into this career for people to be nasty about my family,” she says. “I can have this crazy lifestyle, not going to school, being on set all the time but that’s my choice. When I came into this industry I was just a regular girl, now I know people can twist what you say. That’s really tough.” She was similarly irritated when people criticised her clothes or commented on her nose ring or photographs of her puffing on cigarettes during film breaks, although she admits “it’s not something that really bothers me now”. It did though? “Oh yeah, for a long time, particularly when I was 16 and people online were saying ‘you can’t dress like that, you’re 12’ … it was frustrating.” She pauses, then adds. “Look, any teenager is totally lost at some point. It’s a really mental time. So to have that and then everything else from being on the show was mind-blowing.” Williams, much like her character, is not one to be cowed though. She maintains a vigorous presence online with 323,000 followers on Vine, 1.16 million on Twitter and two million on Instagram. Her feed is a mix of stylish red carpet shots, goofy pics of her hanging out with her family or clubbing with her mates, and lots of snaps of her dog Sonny, a white bundle of fluff she adopted from Bristol Cat and Dogs Home just after Christmas this year. “People just really love seeing Sonny,” she says. “It doesn’t affect me using social media. That’s my generation; it’s what we do. People who slate it are scared of it, which is understandable because it’s mad the power of the internet. I’m not trying to pretend everything’s fun and games, but I do love that I feel so happy online, that I’m part of a whole new generation of kids that get it.” Related: Game of Thrones despises you. And that’s why you love it Beyond Westeros, Willliams has won plaudits as a spiky schoolgirl in Carol Morley’s haunting tale of female hysteria, The Falling. She also popped up in Doctor Who playing immortal Viking Ashildir, and there were rumours she might return as the Doctor’s newest assistant, though she is quick to quash that: “I’m not returning. I can say that. It’s not a secret.” If Game of Thrones hadn’t come along she’d “probably be living in London in someone’s spare bedroom trying to be a dancer and getting by on nothing.” There’s a pause, then she adds quietly: “If I could have had a career in dancing I would have left acting in a second. Like that.” Game of Thrones returns to Sky Atlantic at 2am on 25 April and is repeated at 9pm that evening.

As time goes by, it becomes less and less, so what are we going to do when it runs out? Perhaps we will go back to using horses, carriages and bicycles. In the Second World War, some people didn't use gas made from petroleum  in their cars. They made gas from wood and plants instead.

Original traditional Arabic weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern-day Bedouin weddings and rural weddings, and they are in some cases unique from one region to another, even within the same country. it must be mentioned that what some people today call \\"Bedouin\\" wedding is in fact the original true traditional Arab Islamic wedding without foreign influence. The marriage process usually starts with meetings between the couple's families, and ends with the wedding's consummation (leilat al-dokhla). In Old Palestine, the henna night was a night used to prepare all the necessary wedding decorations and last minute arrangements. It was also a chance for the families to celebrate together before the wedding. The groom's family would sahij or dance through the streets of the village until reaching the house of the bride. Once there, the family would mix henna together, which would then be used to decorate the bride and grooms hands (with the groom's being merely the initials of his bride and himself), and then offer the bride her mahr (usually gold as it does not decline in value like other wealth). The families would then dance and sing traditional Palestinian music.  In modern times, particularly those not living in Palestine, the henna night remains traditional in customs, but is very similar to a bachelorette party; the bride's female friends and relatives join her in celebrating, which includes food, drinks, and a lot of dancing. A women's group plays Arabic music, sometimes Islamic music, while everyone dances. A woman draws henna or mehndi, a temporary form of skin decoration using henna, on the bride and guests' skin -- usually the palms and feet, where the henna color will be darkest because the skin contains higher levels of keratin there, which binds temporarily to lawsone, the colorant of henna.  The men will also have a party, in which the groom's family and friends will dance to traditional Palestinian music. In some village customs, the groom's face is shaven by a close family member or friend in preparation for his wedding. The tradition of giving the bride her gold is also still used. The groom will enter where the bride is, they well both get their henna done, and the groom will then offer the bride her mahr. Thus, the wedding being merely dancing and celebration.  An important element of the henna night in both traditional and non-traditional henna parties, is the dress adorned by the Palestinian women and the groom. The women dress in traditional (usually hand embroidered) gowns, known as Palestinian ithyab. The brides thobe would be extravagant and exquistely embroidered. The groom will wear the usual traditional Arab men's thobe and hata (head covering).

Summarize this article: Edmund will make his competition debut against Belgian number one David Goffin in the opening match (12:30 GMT). Media playback is not supported on this device British number one Andy Murray will then take on world number 108, Ruben Bemelmans. The best-of-five tie takes place over three days in Ghent's Flanders Expo. A capacity crowd of 13,000 is expected each day, with more than 1,000 Britons due at each session despite recent security fears in Belgian capital Brussels, 35 miles away. The British team arrived a day later than planned on Monday but Murray said the team were \\"comfortable\\" with security efforts since their arrival. \\"I know the situation has been difficult for everybody who are making the travel plans,\\" said GB captain Leon Smith. \\"But I know they wouldn't miss it because they've watched us so passionately throughout this whole campaign.\\" Britain are trying to win the 115-year-old competition for the 10th time, but the first since Fred Perry led them to victory over Australia at Wimbledon in 1936. Two years ago, Murray became the first British man since Perry in 1936 to win the Wimbledon singles title, and now he stands on the verge of matching another of his predecessor's achievements. \\"To win the biggest team competition in tennis, having beaten the other three Grand Slam nations [USA, France and Australia in previous rounds], I think it would be a huge victory for everyone in the team,\\" said the Scot. \\"It would be well deserved as well. It's taken a lot of time and hard work from many of the players, many of the staff, coaches, physios, everyone.\\" Belgium have never won the Davis Cup and their only previous final appearance was a 5-0 drubbing by Britain in 1904. \\"For us it's a huge event,\\" said Belgian captain Johan Van Herck. \\"We try to go one further. I think the whole country will be behind us and we'll try to keep the trophy here.\\" Van Herck will hope to put some pressure on Murray in the second tie by ensuring the hosts have an early lead. That is the theory. However, it could just as easily be argued that a surprise win for Edmund would all but determine the tie after just one match, with Murray involved in the next three rubbers. Goffin said: \\"I don't know Kyle a lot. I think he has a great potential. On clay he could be a really good opponent. He won challengers on clay court. I think he's really talented.\\" Edmund said: \\"This is definitely going to be the biggest crowd I've played in front of. Probably the biggest occasion. It's a new experience for me. It's something I'm going to have to learn as I go through the match. But it's a good problem and it's exciting.\\" The second rubber appears something of a mismatch, with left-hander Bemelmans having won just three matches on the ATP Tour this year, compared to Murray's 69 wins and four titles. Murray also boasts a terrific record in the Davis Cup, with just two singles defeats - against Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka in 2005 and Italy's Fabio Fognini in 2014 - and 25 victories. The issue for Murray could well be preserving energy on the indoor clay court before two more days of doubles and singles action. Bemelmans said: \\"It's the first confrontation I have with him, match or practice. It's going to be new for him, as well. I think I probably know him better, how he plays, than him me. Maybe I have a slight advantage there.\\" Murray said: \\"I know his game a bit, but actually I don't know the Belgian players that well because I've never played against any of them except Goffin. It's quite a strange situation to be in. Whoever had played the first day, I would never have practised with them or played against them, so it doesn't change much.\\" Listen to the Radio 5 live podcast:'We're going to take the cup home'","output":"In the Davis Cup Final, Britain and Belgium are set to face off in Ghent's Flanders Expo for a best-of-five tie over a span of three days. 13,000 people are expected to show up each day, with 1,000 Britons attending each session in spite of security concerns in Brussels, which is located just 35 miles away.

Two farmer's associations used different agricultural methods when growing crops. Bold farm used lots of fertilizers over the years, while Shallow farm used organic methods combined with methods from permaculture.  Which farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water? Answer:","output":"To determine which farm contributes less to the consumption of oxygen in the water, we need to analyze the impact of each farm's agricultural methods on water quality. Step 1: Analyze the impact of fertilizers used by Bold farm - Fertilizers contain high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, which can lead to excessive algae growth in bodies of water when they run off the fields. - As algae die, they sink to the bottom and are decomposed by bacteria, a process that consumes dissolved oxygen in the water. This can lead to oxygen depletion and negatively impact aquatic life. Step 2: Analyze the impact of organic methods and permaculture used by Shallow farm - Organic farming methods generally use natural alternatives to synthetic fertilizers, which can contribute less nitrogen and phosphorus to water bodies. - Permaculture methods often involve creating a diverse, self-sustaining ecosystem to improve soil health and minimize the need for external inputs like fertilizers. This can result in less runoff and thus reduced oxygen consumption in bodies of water. Step 3: Compare the impacts - Bold farm uses lots of fertilizers, contributing to excess nutrients in bodies of water and potentially causing oxygen depletion. - Shallow farm uses organic methods and permaculture, likely reducing nutrient runoff and causing less oxygen consumption in the water. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, Shallow farm, which utilizes organic methods and permaculture, is likely to contribute less to the consumption of oxygen in the water compared to Bold farm, which uses high amounts of fertilizers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This grip is good for beginners because your will use your index finger to help guide the ball towards its target. Use this pitch to practice your curveball technique, but avoid using it in games. Experienced batters are likely to see the raised index finger and adjust their stance in anticipation of a curveball. Bend your middle finger, leaving your index finger pointing upwards. Like in the standard curveball grip, let the bottom of the ball rest against the side of your ring finer. Place your thumb on the back of the ball so it lies along the bottom seam. Position your middle finger along the top seam opposite your thumb. At this point, your thumb and middle finger should form a \\"C\\" while your index finger is pointed up. Make sure your index finger is up and relaxed, and the ball is firmly gripped by your thumb (bottom) and middle finger (top).  While your grip should be firm, relax the muscles in your wrist and forearm. When throwing, your thumb rotates up while your middle finger rotates down. Use your index finger to control the trajectory of the ball - the ball will go in the direction in which your index finger is pointing.  Your index finger is not needed to throw the pitch, with the thumb and middle finger providing all the spin.  When throwing, your elbow should be at the same height or above your shoulder. Your hand and wrist should form a vertical line with your forearm.  Keep your forearm and wrist muscles loose until just prior to release. Strongly contract them and quickly snap your wrist forward and inwards, allowing the ball to spin out over the middle finger.

The grip involves positioning the thumb and middle finger along the bottom and top seams of the ball, respectively, while the index finger stays relaxed and pointed upwards. The throw requires a firm grip, but relaxed wrist and forearm muscles, with rotation from the thumb and middle finger to provide spin. Although effective for practice, it's not recommended in games as experienced batters may spot the raised index finger and anticipate a curveball."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first sentence states that the high temperature on Saturday is expected to be about 92 degrees, while the high for Sunday and Monday will likely be 90 degrees. This sentence mentions Saturday explicitly and provides temperature information for three days (Saturday, Sunday, and Monday). It also indicates that there is no significant difference between the high temperatures of Sunday and Monday, as both are likely to be around 90 degrees. 2. The second sentence mentions that the high temperature today will be about 92 degrees and will drop to 90 degrees on Sunday and Monday. Assuming \\"today\\" refers to Saturday, the high temperatures for all three days are similar to the information provided in the first sentence, with slight variances in the wording and presentation. In this sentence, the term \\"today\\" implies that the current day is Saturday.

Instead, she turned her attention back to the dog. Its fur was matted and dirty, and its eyes held a mixture of fear and confusion. It was obvious that the poor animal had been through a lot, especially with the disappearance of the Sandwich Man, who had been known to take care of stray animals in the neighborhood. Torus, not as harsh as Chello, but still uncertain about the situation, suggested, \\"Maybe we could find its owner or at least someone who can take better care of it?\\" Nevi nodded in agreement. \\"That's a great idea, Torus. Let's ask around and see if anyone knows who the dog belongs to, or if someone wants to adopt it.\\" And so, the three friends, Nevi, Torus, and Chello, began their quest to find a new home for the lost dog. They asked people in the area whether they knew anything about the dog. Most of the residents were equally sad about the Sandwich Man's sudden departure and sympathized with the dog's plight but couldn't offer any help. Undeterred, Nevi suggested they take their search online. They posted pictures of the dog on local social media groups and community forums, hoping that someone might recognize it and claim or adopt it. The post gained a lot of attention and kind-hearted comments, but no potential owner came forward. As the days went by, the three friends started taking turns caring for the dog themselves. They fed it, bathed it, and gradually started growing attached to the lonely animal. Nevi named the dog Lucky, believing that it deserved a chance at a better future. Chello, initially against the idea of getting involved with the dog, couldn't help but find himself warming up to Lucky. He even began teaching the dog some simple commands, which Lucky eagerly learned. Chello soon found that perhaps the dog wasn't as stupid as he'd claimed. One day, as Nevi, Torus, and Chello were playing with Lucky in the park, a woman approached them. She looked both excited and relieved, explaining that Lucky was her dog, and she had been searching for him for weeks. While on vacation, her pet sitter had accidentally let Lucky escape, and she'd been heartbroken ever since. The friends were bittersweet about handing Lucky over to his rightful owner, but they knew it was the right thing to do. They exchanged contact information with the owner, who expressed her deep gratitude and promised to keep them updated on Lucky's life. As they watched Lucky leave with his owner, Nevi, Torus, and Chello felt proud of their efforts. They'd made a difference in the life of a lost dog and, in the process, learned a valuable lesson about empathy, friendship, and never giving up. And while they would miss Lucky dearly, they knew that they had succeeded in giving him the chance at a happy life that he truly deserved."},{"instruction":"What type of details about ben tamburello  can be gathered from the following bio?
