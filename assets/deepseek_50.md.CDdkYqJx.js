Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this: 1. **Set up Your Development Environment**: Ensure you have Node.js installed, as Electron requires it. 2. **Initialize a New Node.js Project**: Create a new directory for your project and run \`npm init\` to create a \`package.json\` file. 3. **Install Electron**: Install Electron globally or in your project directory by running: \`\`\`bash npm install --save-dev electron \`\`\` 4. **Create Your Main Script**: Electron applications have a main script that initializes the app. Create a file called \`main.js\` with the following content: \`\`\`javascript const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron'); const path = require('path'); function createWindow() { const win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600, webPreferences: { webviewTag: true // This is required for webview tag } }); // Load a local HTML file or an external URL // win.loadFile('index.html'); win.loadURL('https://example.com'); // Replace this with your desired website. } app.whenReady().then(() => { createWindow(); app.on('activate', () => { if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) { createWindow(); } }); }); app.on('window-all-closed', () => { if (process.platform !== 'darwin') { app.quit(); } }); \`\`\` 5. **Create an HTML File for Your Application** (Optional): If you want to use an HTML file as a container for the webview, create an \`index.html\` file. You might include styles and scripts here to make the UI feel more like a native app. Example \`index.html\`: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My Electron App</title> <!-- Add your styling and scripts here --> </head> <body> <webview src=\\"https://example.com\\" style=\\"width:100%; height:100%\\"></webview> </body> </html> \`\`\` 6. **Configure the Application**: Add a start script to your \`package.json\` file: \`\`\`json \\"scripts\\": { \\"start\\": \\"electron .\\" }, \`\`\` 7. **Run Your Application**: Execute the following command to start your Electron app: \`\`\`bash npm start \`\`\` This will open a new Electron window displaying the external website, but it will look and feel like a native application because of the wrapper you've applied.

We saw that there was another car that must have been next to us during the shooting that was parked there with the police so my dad talked to the police about what the shooter's car looked like. But thankfully everyone was fine. The people in the other car said their car was luckily not hit, but now I realized they were just using us for cover. After that we took the highway and noticed one of the exits coming up had a car wash. So when the exit came we took it and noticed nobody was there. It looked closed but it was open so we cleaned out all of the broken glass and put it in the trash. After that we saw life differently. We realized how important it is to control your emotions and be aware of your surroundings so everyone is safe. People should always be in control of their emotions because if we got out of control and didn't focus, someone could have gotten shot or we could have crashed. Self awareness is important because it helps us become better decision makers. It is important because it helps you understand the situation you are in. And it is also important because it helps you manage your emotions better.","output":"In the aftermath of the terrifying incident, the adrenaline coursing through our veins slowly dissipated, leaving behind a profound sense of gratitude and a newfound perspective on life. My family and I had narrowly escaped a potentially tragic fate, but the experience had left an indelible mark on our hearts and minds. As we continued our journey, the image of the shooter's car lingered in our thoughts. The police assured us that they were doing everything in their power to find the culprits and bring them to justice. It was a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there were those who dedicated their lives to protecting innocent people like us. The car wash became our sanctuary, a place where we could physically and metaphorically wash away the remnants of the terrifying ordeal. As we cleaned out the broken glass, each shard seemed to symbolize the shattered sense of security we had once taken for granted. But with every piece we discarded, we also discarded our fears and allowed hope to trickle back into our lives. From that moment on, we vowed to approach life with a heightened sense of self-awareness. No longer content to merely exist in our own little bubbles, we expanded our horizons and started paying closer attention to the world around us. We learned to decipher the subtle cues and signals that, if overlooked, could have dire consequences. Our once mundane surroundings became a tapestry of hidden dangers and hidden beauty, and we became acutely aware of our own small place within it. Embracing self-awareness meant taking control of our emotions, channeling our fear into strength and determination. We recognized that panic and recklessness had no place in our lives. Instead, we cultivated a calm and composed demeanor, refusing to let external turmoil consume us. It was a conscious effort, one that required patience and practice, but it was a small price to pay for the safety and well-being of our loved ones. Our harrowing experience became a catalyst for change, a wake-up call that reminded us of the fragility of life. We vowed to never take another day for granted, cherishing every precious moment with renewed gratitude. The world, once predictable and mundane, now brimmed with possibilities. We found solace in the beauty of ordinary moments and reveled in the simple joys that often went unnoticed. As time passed, the wounds inflicted by that fateful day slowly healed, both physically and emotionally. The shattered glass was replaced, the scars faded, but the lessons learned remained etched in our hearts forever. We became advocates for self-awareness, sharing our story with others in the hopes that they too would learn to navigate life's uncertainties with clarity and composure. In the end, it was not the deafening sound of gunfire or the shattered glass that defined us, but rather our unwavering resilience and determination to rise above the chaos.

The stark differences in the economic activities and resources between the North and South fueled the tensions and conflicts that ultimately led to the Civil War. Firstly, the agricultural practices and the reliance on slave labor in the South resulted in the growth of the cotton industry. The invention of Eli Whitney's cotton gin revolutionized cotton production and made it extremely profitable. The South became heavily dependent on cotton as the main cash crop, leading to an exponential increase in cotton plantations. This economic success, however, was driven by the institution of slavery which generated serious moral and political debates. The expansion and profitability of cotton production in the South contributed to the increasing demand for enslaved labor. As a result, the South fought hard to protect slavery as an economic system, while the North, with its more diverse economy, began to shift towards industrialization and manufacturing. The stark contrast in economic models between the two regions created deep divisions and conflicting interests. Moreover, the North experienced rapid industrialization, characterized by the growth of factories, textile mills, and shipping industries. This economic transformation attracted a labor force from different parts of the country and overseas migration. The North's emphasis on manufacturing and commerce gave rise to a different set of political and social values that clashed with the agrarian and slave-based economy of the South. The economic factors not only shaped the regional economies but also impacted politics and legislation. For instance, the Tariff of 1828, commonly known as the Tariff of Abominations, imposed high taxes on imported goods to protect Northern industries. This protective tariff was strongly opposed by the South, as it significantly increased the cost of manufactured goods that they relied on. Additionally, the expansion of the United States towards the West brought further economic tensions between the North and South. The issue of whether new territories should allow or prohibit slavery sparked heated debates. The South sought to expand slavery in order to maintain their agrarian economic system, while the North feared the extension of slavery to new territories would undermine their competing interests and values. In conclusion, economic factors played a significant role in the regional rivalries during the period of 1800-1848 in America. The differences in agrarian-based slavery-driven economies of the South and industrialized economies of the North were at the core of these rivalries.

In Japanese culture, パパ (papa) often refers to \\"dad\\" or \\"father,\\" and adding ス could be just a name-ending or a stylization. It could also be from a specific context, like a character name from a game or a show. 「そっそうか!」 - This is a phrase that consists of an interjection and an expression. 1. そっ - This is likely a stuttered version of 「そう」 which means \\"so\\" or \\"that way\\". The repetition of the first syllable 「そっ」 adds a nuance of hesitation or surprise. 2. そう - As mentioned, 「そう」 means \\"so,\\" \\"that way,\\" or \\"thus.\\" It's a common adverb in Japanese. 3. か - This is a question marker in Japanese. When added to the end of a sentence or phrase, it indicates that the speaker is asking a question or seeking confirmation. Putting it together, 「そっそうか！」would translate to something like \\"Is that so?\\" with a connotation of surprise, hesitation, or sudden realization. It expresses that the speaker is somewhat taken aback or caught off guard by new information or a sudden realization and is asking for confirmation in a somewhat flustered manner. Finally, the use of the quotation marks 「」 around the phrase 「そっそうか!」 indicates that it is a spoken line, possibly from a story or dialogue, and that パパス is the character who is speaking."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically *「パパスさま おめでとうございます!","output":"The phrase \\"「パパスさま おめでとうございます!」\\" is a formal and polite phrase in Japanese. Let's break down the components: 1. 「パパスさま」 - \\"パパス\\" (Papas) is a proper noun, which appears to be a name. The suffix \\"さま\\" (sama) is an honorific used to confer great respect. It is more polite and reverent than \\"さん\\" (san), and it implies a higher status of the person you are addressing. So, \\"パパスさま\\" would translate to \\"Lord Papas,\\" \\"Master Papas,\\" or \\"Sir Papas,\\" depending on the context. 2. 「おめでとうございます」 - This is a formal and polite expression that means \\"congratulations\\" or \\"best wishes.\\" The phrase is made up of two parts: - \\"おめでとう\\" (omedetou) is the congratulatory term itself. - \\"ございます\\" (gozaimasu) is the polite form of the verb \\"to be.\\" It is often used to show respect and humility in formal speech. Putting it together, \\"「パパスさま おめでとうございます!」\\" can be translated into English as \\"Congratulations, Lord Papas!\\" or \\"Best wishes, Sir Papas!\\" This phrase is typically used when congratulating someone of higher status on a special occasion, achievement, or commemoration. The use of the exclamation mark \\"!\\" at the end of the sentence suggests enthusiasm or strong emotion on the part of the speaker."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically ※ほんとうに かわいい たまのような男の子で!","output":"The phrase \\"※ほんとうに かわいい たまのような男の子で!\\" is a Japanese sentence that conveys a compliment toward a boy, likening him to an adorable jewel or a round object. Let's break it down grammatically: 1. ※ - This symbol is commonly used in Japanese writing to denote a reference or a footnote. In this context, however, it may be used for emphasis or as a decorative symbol before the main sentence. 2. ほんとうに (hontou ni) - \\"ほんとうに\\" is an adverb that means \\"truly\\" or \\"really.\\" It emphasizes the sincerity of the statement that follows. 3. かわいい (kawaii) - \\"かわいい\\" is an i-adjective meaning \\"cute\\" or \\"adorable.\\" In Japanese, i-adjectives can directly modify nouns, and as part of this sentence, it is describing the boy mentioned. 4. たまのような (tama no you na) - This phrase is a simile. \\"たま\\" (tama) means \\"jewel\\" or \\"ball,\\" and \\"のような\\" (no you na) translates to \\"like\\" or \\"such as.\\" \\"たまのような\\" can be understood as \\"like a jewel,\\" used to compare the boy's cuteness or preciousness to that of a jewel. It can also convey roundness or perfection, as \\"tama\\" can imply something spherical and pleasing. 5. 男の子 (otoko no ko) - \\"男の子\\" means \\"boy.\\" \\"男\\" (otoko) means \\"man\\" or \\"male,\\" and \\"の子\\" (no ko) means \\"child.\\" So \\"男の子\\" refers to a male child or a boy. 6. で (de) - In this context, \\"で\\" is an informal copula or state-of-being verb that can be translated as \\"is.\\" It may appear as though the sentence is incomplete because it ends with \\"で\\" instead of \\"です\\" (desu, the more polite copula), but in casual speech, particularly when expressing an exclamation or an emotional statement, it's not uncommon to end the sentence with \\"で\\" as a kind of emotive pause. So, the whole phrase \\"※ほんとうに かわいい たまのような男の子で!\\" would translate to \\"He really is an adorable, jewel-like boy!\\" or \\"He's truly a cute boy, just like a gem!\\" in English. The sentence expresses admiration for the boy's cuteness and implies that he is as precious as a jewel. The exclamation point indicates excitement or enthusiasm in the statement."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically パパス「うむっ。","output":"The phrase \\"パパス「うむっ。」\\" appears to be a line of dialogue from a speaker named パパス (Papas). Let's go through the elements: 1. パパス (Papas) - This is a proper noun, most likely the name of a character who is speaking. The use of the name here indicates that this is a line of dialogue attributed to Papas. 2. 「うむっ」 (um) - This is an interjection that conveys affirmation or agreement. It's somewhat old-fashioned and masculine in tone, often used by male characters in Japanese media. It could be likened to the English \\"hmm,\\" \\"yes,\\" \\"indeed,\\" \\"hmph,\\" or \\"ugh,\\" depending on context. The small \\"っ\\" at the end, called a \\"sokuon\\" or \\"little tsu,\\" indicates a glottal stop or a slight pause and adds emphasis or can express a grunt or a forceful utterance. 3. 。 - This is a period or full stop, marking the end of the sentence. When written as \\"パパス「うむっ。」\\", it suggests that the character Papas is either responding affirmatively to something with a sort of grunt or making a brief affirmative statement. This kind of grunt or non-verbal affirmation is common in Japanese and can show the character's personality; in this case, it might imply that Papas is a somewhat gruff, terse, or serious character. In dialogue form, this would simply translate to Papas saying \\"Hmm,\\" \\"Yes,\\" or \\"Indeed,\\" with a masculine or assertive tone, but without knowing the surrounding context, the specific nuance can be difficult to ascertain."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically マーサ「あなた･････。","output":"The phrase \\"マーサ「あなた･････。」\\" is a fragment of Japanese dialogue. Here's the grammatical breakdown: 1. マーサ (Māsa) - This is a proper noun, most likely a character's name, which could be translated as \\"Martha\\" in English. In a written script or dialogue, this indicates that the character named マーサ (Māsa) is the one speaking. 2. 「」 - These quotation marks indicate that the text inside is spoken dialogue. In Japanese, these are called 『』 or 「」 and are referred to as 鉤括弧 (kagi kakko). 3. あなた (anata) - This is a pronoun that means \\"you\\" in Japanese. It is commonly used as a polite second-person pronoun, but it can also be used by a wife to refer to her husband, or it could imply a sense of intimacy or familiarity depending on the context. 4. ･････ - The horizontal ellipsis (･････) here consists of four dots (usually three are used, but four is not uncommon in Japanese). This punctuation mark indicates a pause or silence in the dialogue, which can imply hesitation, uncertainty, trailing off, or an emotional state that the character is experiencing, leaving the sentence unfinished. 5. 。 - This is a full stop, or period, indicating the end of the sentence. Even though the sentence is incomplete, the period gives a sense of finality to the spoken thought. In this particular case, without further context, it is challenging to provide a single definitive interpretation. However, the phrase could suggest that Martha is addressing someone (あなた, \\"you\\"), perhaps with an emotional or thoughtful undertone, but then trails off or hesitates, unable to continue her sentence. In English, a rough translation might read \\"Martha: You...\\" with the understanding that the feeling or thought is not fully expressed."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically パパス「よくやったな! おうおう このように 元気に 泣いて･････。","output":"The phrase \\"パパス「よくやったな! おうおう このように 元気に 泣いて･････。」\\" appears to be a line of spoken dialogue from a character named パパス (Papas). Let's break it down grammatically: 1. パパス (Papas) - This is the character's name who is speaking. This proper noun indicates that the following dialogue is spoken by Papas. 2. 「」 - These are Japanese quotation marks used to enclose the spoken words of Papas. 3. よくやったな (yoku yatta na) - This phrase is an expression of praise or approval. - よく (yoku) is an adverb meaning \\"well\\" or \\"nicely.\\" - やった (yatta) is the past tense form of the verb やる (yaru), meaning \\"to do.\\" So やった means \\"did it\\" or \\"have done.\\" - な (na) is a sentence-ending particle used by a speaker to convey a light assertion or emotional emphasis, often found in masculine speech. It is similar to saying \\"huh?\\" or \\"right?\\" in English, seeking a mild agreement or just added for emphasis. 4. おうおう (ou ou) - This is an interjection that can express various emotions depending on context, such as surprise, encouragement, or in this case, it may be an affectionate utterance, similar to \\"oh oh\\" or \\"there there\\" as one might say soothingly. 5. このように (kono you ni) - This phrase means \\"like this\\" or \\"in this way.\\" - この (kono) is a demonstrative adjective meaning \\"this.\\" - ように (you ni) is a phrase that means \\"like\\" or \\"as.\\" 6. 元気に (genki ni) - This is an adverbial form of 元気 (genki), which means \\"healthy,\\" \\"energetic,\\" or \\"lively.\\" When turned into an adverb with に (ni), it means \\"vigorously\\" or \\"with energy.\\" 7. 泣いて (naite) - This is the -te form of the verb 泣く (naku), which means \\"to cry.\\" The -te form is often used to indicate a continuous action or a command/request, but here it likely represents a continuous state (crying). 8. ･････ - The horizontal ellipsis indicates a pause in speech, suggesting the speaker trails off or leaves the sentence incomplete. Putting it all together, \\"パパス「よくやったな! おうおう このように 元気に 泣いて･････。」\\" translates to \\"Papas: Well done! Oh, oh, crying like this so energetically...\\" The character Papas is expressing approval or praise (potentially toward a child) for something well done and then affectionately commenting on the lively manner in which the child is crying, though he doesn't finish the sentence, implying that there's an emotional component to the observation that's left unsaid."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically “ パパス「さっそくだが この子に名前をつけないと いけないな。”","output":"The sentence \\"パパス「さっそくだが この子に名前をつけないと いけないな。」\\" is another piece of dialogue from the character named パパス (Papas). Here's a breakdown of the grammatical elements in the sentence: 1. パパス (Papas) - Again, this is the proper noun for the character who is speaking, and the name is placed before the quotation marks to indicate that he is the one speaking. 2. 「」 - These are Japanese quotation marks that enclose the character's spoken words. 3. さっそくだが (sassoku da ga) - This phrase is made up of two parts: - さっそく (sassoku): An adverb meaning \\"immediately\\" or \\"right away.\\" - だ (da): The plain form of the copula \\"to be,\\" equivalent to \\"is\\" in this context. - が (ga): A conjunction that can be translated to \\"but\\" or \\"however.\\" It indicates that what follows will add information or somewhat contrast with what has been said. 4. この子に (kono ko ni) - This phrase comprises a demonstrative adjective and noun followed by a particle: - この (kono): Demonstrative adjective meaning \\"this.\\" - 子 (ko): Noun meaning \\"child\\" or \\"kid.\\" - に (ni): Particle indicating a target or recipient of an action. 5. 名前をつけないと (namae o tsukenai to) - This part contains a noun, a particle, a verb in its negative form, and a conditional \\"to\\": - 名前 (namae): Noun meaning \\"name.\\" - を (o): Object-marking particle. - つけない (tsukenai): The negative form of the verb つける (tsukeru), meaning \\"to name\\" or \\"to attach.\\" So つけない means \\"not name\\" or \\"do not name.\\" - と (to): Conditional particle that in this case is part of an expression that means \\"must do\\" or \\"have to do.\\" The expression \\"verb-nai form + といけない\\" (verb-nai to ikenai) is a common way to express obligation or necessity, \\"have to [verb].\\" 6. いけない (ikenai) - This literally means \\"not go\\" or \\"not good\\" and is used here as part of the abovementioned expression \\"つけないといけない\\" to indicate that something \\"must be done.\\" 7. な (na) - A sentence-ending particle that here adds a nuanced feeling of contemplation or light assertiveness, softening the statement. Translated to English, the sentence \\"パパス「さっそくだが この子に名前をつけないと いけないな。」\\" means, \\"Papas: Though it's sudden, we have to give this child a name.\\" In this context, the character Papas is implying that despite the suddenness of the situation, it's necessary or important to name the child immediately."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically 「パパス「う~ん･･･","output":"The phrase \\"「パパス「う~ん･･･」\\" appears to be a line of dialogue from a character named パパス (Papas) and includes some specific Japanese grammatical elements. 1. 「パパス」 (Papas) - This is a proper noun, the name of the character who is speaking. 2. 「」 - These are Japanese quotation marks signifying the commencement of the character's speech. Japanese quotation marks come in pairs, with an opening「 and a closing 」. 3. う~ん (u~n) - This is a vocalization that represents a sound made when someone is thinking, pondering, or hesitating, similar to \\"hmm\\" or \\"uh-huh\\" in English. The tilde (~) elongates the \\"う\\" sound, adding a sense of prolonged thought or contemplation. 4. ･･･ - This is the Japanese punctuation for an ellipsis. It is often used to indicate a pause, trailing off, or an unfinished thought in speech. The fact that the sentence ends with an ellipsis suggests that the speaker's thought is continuing, or they are at a loss for words, reflecting hesitation or uncertainty. 5. 「 - Normally, there would be a closing quotation mark to conclude the spoken part, but it seems to be missing in this context. The text may imply that there's more speech or text to follow, or it might just be an accidental omission or typo. In summary, the phrase \\"「パパス「う~ん･･･」\\" grammatically consists of a proper noun indicating the speaker, followed by an utterance and punctuation that indicate hesitation or deep thought. The repeating quotation marks could be a typo or formatting mistake; in normal usage, you would only need one set of quotes to denote speech."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically 「パパス「よしうかんだぞ! トンヌラ というのは どうだろうかっ!?","output":"The phrase \\"「パパス「よしうかんだぞ! トンヌラ というのは どうだろうかっ!?」\\" contains a potential typographical error with the double opening quotation marks. However, considering the intended structure, this can be grammatically interpreted as dialogue from a character named パパス (Papas). Here is a grammatical breakdown of the correct sentence, assuming one set of quotation marks is superfluous: 「パパス「よしうかんだぞ! トンヌラ というのは どうだろうかっ!?」 Should be: 「パパス「よし、うかんだぞ! トンヌラ というのは どうだろうか!?」 1. 「パパス」 (Papas) - This is the name of the character speaking. In a script or text, it denotes that the following words are spoken by Papas. 2. 「」 - These are Japanese quotation marks. The sentence seems to contain an error with two opening quotation marks, which is not standard. The correct usage should include an opening 「 and a closing 」 to indicate dialogue. 3. よし (yoshi) - This is an interjection meaning \\"alright,\\" \\"good,\\" or \\"okay,\\" expressing that the speaker is pleased or has made a decision. 4. 、 - This symbol is a Japanese comma, used here to separate the interjection from the rest of the sentence. 5. うかんだぞ (ukanda zo) - This could be a misspelling or a stylized expression. If it's a typo, it might mean to represent a different word or phrase, such as \\"思い浮かんだぞ\\" (omoi ukanda zo), which means \\"I've got it\\" or \\"It came to mind.\\" Here, \\"ぞ\\" (zo) is a masculine emphatic sentence-ending particle that adds assertion to the statement. 6. トンヌラ (Tonnura) - This appears to be a proper noun and is likely a name being suggested by the character Papas. It may be a name for a person, character, or object within the context of the dialogue. 7. というのは (to iu no wa) - This is a phrase that can translate to \\"the one called\\" or \\"how about,\\" and it sets up a question or suggestion about the name just mentioned. - という (to iu) is a phrase that literally translates to \\"that says\\" or \\"called.\\" - の (no) is a nominalizer turning the preceding verbal phrase into a noun phrase. - は (wa) is a topic-marking particle. 8. どうだろうか (dou darou ka) - This is a phrase used to ask for someone's opinion or to make a suggestion. - どう (dou) means \\"how.\\" - だろう (darou) is a form that indicates supposition or conjecture, similar to \\"I wonder\\" or \\"maybe.\\" - か (ka) is a question marker. 9. !? - This punctuation mark is a combination of an exclamation mark and a question mark, indicating a strong emphasis coupled with questioning. The sentence \\"「パパス「よしうかんだぞ! トンヌラ というのは どうだろうかっ!?」\\" suggests the correct version would be \\"パパス「よし、思い浮かんだぞ! トンヌラ というのは どうだろうか!?」\\" This would then translate to something like \\"Papas: Alright, I've got it! How about calling [it/him/her] Tonnura!?\\" Papas seems to be suggesting a name and asking for an opinion, with an enthusiastic and inquisitive tone."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically マーサ「でもね わたしも考えていたのです。","output":"The phrase \\"マーサ「でもね わたしも考えていたのです。」\\" is a piece of dialogue spoken by a character named Martha (マーサ) in Japanese. Here's the grammatical analysis: 1. マーサ (Māsa) - This is a proper noun, presumably the name of the character speaking. It's presented before the dialogue to attribute the speech to her. 2. 「」 - These are Japanese quotation marks used to enclose Martha's spoken words. 3. でもね (demo ne) - This phrase can be broken down into two parts: - でも (demo): A conjunction meaning \\"but\\" or \\"however,\\" signaling a contrast or exception to what was previously said or thought. - ね (ne): A sentence-ending particle that can serve various purposes, such as seeking agreement, adding a casual tone, or softening the statement. 4. わたし (watashi) - This is a first-person pronoun meaning \\"I\\" or \\"me,\\" used here to refer to the speaker herself. 5. も (mo) - This particle means \\"also\\" or \\"too,\\" indicating that Martha is adding her own actions or thoughts in addition to what has been mentioned before. 6. 考えていた (kangaete ita) - This is the past continuous form of the verb 考える (kangaeru), meaning \\"to think\\" or \\"to consider.\\" Here, it is composed of the -te form of the verb (考えて, kangaete), which denotes an ongoing action or state, and いた (ita), the past tense of いる (iru), a verb that, when used in conjunction with the -te form, indicates a past continuous action – in this case, \\"was thinking.\\" 7. の (no) - This particle can have various functions, but in this context, it is a nominalizer that turns the preceding verb phrase 考えていた (kangaete ita) into a noun phrase, essentially meaning \\"the fact that [I] was thinking.\\" 8. です (desu) - This is the polite form of the copula \\"to be\\" in Japanese. In this context, it adds a level of politeness to Martha's statement and is also used to state or affirm the information about her thoughts. So, putting it all together, \\"マーサ「でもね わたしも考えていたのです。」\\" translates to \\"Martha: But, you know, I was also thinking...\\" in English. This sentence suggests that Martha has something to say or contribute to the conversation, possibly her own thoughts or considerations on the matter being discussed. The use of です (desu) at the end indicates that she is speaking politely."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically マーサ「おあこそというのは どうかしら?","output":"The phrase \\"マーサ「おあこそというのは どうかしら?\\" is a piece of dialogue spoken by a character named Martha (マーシャ), which contains several grammatical components of the Japanese language: 1. マーサ (Māsa) - This is a proper noun, the name of the character speaking, which is used here to indicate that the line is being spoken by her. It's transliterated as Māsa or Māsha depending on the intended pronunciation. 2. 「」 - These are Japanese quotation marks that denote the beginning and end of the dialogue. 3. おあこそ (oakoso) - This appears to be a phrase or a name that is being proposed by the speaker. However, without more context, it isn't clear what \\"おあこそ\\" specifically refers to, as it's not a standard word or name in Japanese. It could potentially be a non-standard or made-up name or term within the context of the conversation or story. 4. というのは (to iu no wa) - This is a common Japanese phrase structure that can be translated to \\"the one called,\\" \\"the thing called,\\" or \\"how about.\\" It is composed of three parts: - という (to iu), which is a quoting particle plus verb construction that means \\"called\\" or \\"named.\\" - の (no), which is a nominalizing particle that turns the verb phrase into a noun-like structure. - は (wa), which is the topic-marking particle in Japanese. It identifies what the rest of the sentence is discussing. 5. どう (dou) - This is an adverb meaning \\"how\\" or \\"what,\\" which inquires about the state or quality of something. 6. かしら (kashira) - This is a sentence-ending particle typically used by female speakers to express uncertainty or conjecture about the preceding statement. It can be translated as \\"I wonder\\" in English. When put together, マーサ「おあこそというのは どうかしら?」translates approximately to \\"Martha: How about the one called 'Oakoso,' I wonder?\\" or \\"Martha: What do you think about 'Oakoso'?\\" in English. Martha is suggesting a name or term and is seeking the listener's opinion or approval."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically “ パパス「おあこそが･･････。 どうも パッとしない名だな。”","output":"The phrase \\"パパス「おあこそが･･････。 どうも パッとしない名だな。」\\" is a line of dialogue from a character named パパス (Papas). Here's the grammatical breakdown: 1. パパス (Papas) - The proper noun indicating the name of the character speaking. 2. 「」 - Japanese quotation marks that indicate spoken dialogue. 3. おあこそが (oakoso ga) - This seems to be a name or term followed by the particle \\"が\\" (ga), which functions as a subject marker in Japanese, indicating that \\"おあこそ\\" (Oakoso) is the subject of the sentence. The use of \\"･･････\\" (ellipses) after the subject suggests a pause or trailing off, indicating hesitation or a thought that is not fully expressed. 4. どうも (doumo) - An adverb that can have various meanings depending on context. Here, it likely indicates a sense of dissatisfaction or a feeling that something isn't quite right. 5. パッとしない (patto shinai) - This is an idiomatic expression: - \\"パッと\\" (patto) is an onomatopoeic adverb describing something that pops or stands out conspicuously. - \\"しない\\" (shinai) is the negative form of the auxiliary verb \\"する\\" (suru), which means \\"to do.\\" Together, \\"パッとしない\\" translates to \\"doesn't stand out\\" or \\"is not striking.\\" 6. 名 (na) - This noun means \\"name\\". When used with \\"が\\" earlier, the construct becomes \\"the name Oakoso\\". 7. だ (da) - This is the plain form of the copula, equivalent to the English \\"is,\\" and it links the subject to the comment about it. In this case, it's part of the phrase \\"名だ\\" (na da), meaning \\"it is a name.\\" 8. な (na) - A sentence-ending particle that adds emotive emphasis or reflects the speaker’s personal judgment. Here, it is used to show that the speaker is mulling over his thoughts or seeking affirmation. The whole phrase \\"パパス「おあこそが･･････。 どうも パッとしない名だな。」\\" therefore translates to something like \\"Papas: 'Oakoso'... It really doesn't have a ring to it,\\" or more directly, \\"Papas: Regarding 'Oakoso'...

The combined \\"大丈夫か!?\\" is a common Japanese expression used to ask somebody if they are okay, often used in situations where there is some concern for the person being addressed. The sentence could translate to \\"Are you okay!?\\" or \\"Is everything alright!?\\" in English. The use of \\"!?\\" at the end of the sentence conveys a sense of urgency or strong emotion, implying that the speaker is intensely concerned about the well-being of the person they're asking.

In this internal assessment, we will examine the extent to which the high cost of EpiPens, set by Mylan N.V., the pharmaceutical company responsible for their production, is economically justified and ethically sound. We will apply theories and concepts from the International Baccalaureate (IB) Business and Management course to critically assess the implications of these pricing strategies. Economic Adequacy From an economic standpoint, the price of a product is typically determined by the forces of demand and supply. Mylan enjoys a virtual monopoly on the market, which allows them to set higher prices. According to Elasticities (IB Business and Management, Chapter 2.1), demand for EpiPens is highly inelastic because it is a necessary, life-saving medication with no close substitutes. This inelastic demand means consumers are willing to pay higher prices, thereby allowing the company to set prices above marginal costs. Costs and Break-even Analysis (Chapter 1.6.2) would suggest that the pricing should be set to cover the costs and achieve a fair profit margin. However, Mylan's pricing strategy may far exceed just covering costs and may instead be exploiting market power. Investment appraisal (Chapter 1.6.3) used by the company needs to be considered, too; perhaps the company justifies the pricing by the initial R&D and regulatory costs that are typically associated with the pharmaceutical industry. Ethical Considerations Business Ethics (Chapter 2.3) involve applying moral principles to business behavior. The primary ethical issue with EpiPen pricing is whether it is fair to charge high prices for essential medications. Utilitarianism, a concept discussed in the curriculum, would argue that the action that provides the greatest good for the greatest number is the ethically appropriate one. In this case, the question arises whether Mylan's pricing strategy benefits the majority, especially when it leads to a subset of individuals being unable to afford potentially life-saving medication. Stakeholders (Chapter 1.2) are also a crucial element of ethical consideration. The stakeholders of Mylan include not only the shareholders but also the consumers, employees, suppliers, and society at large. High prices may lead to large profits and happy shareholders but can result in a lack of access for patients who need the medication, along with public outcry and damage to reputation. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) (Chapter 2.3) is an essential framework for evaluating the extent to which businesses are obligated to consider the interests of society. An evaluation of Mylan's actions will involve scrutinizing their adherence to CSR principles and whether they are acting responsibly toward the community by ensuring EpiPens are affordable. Conclusion In conclusion, from an economic perspective, the high price of EpiPens could be seen as a result of monopoly pricing and inelastic demand, allowing Mylan to maximize profits. However, this does not account for the necessary investment appraisal considerations that could justify the pricing scheme. Ethically, the price hikes may be seen as incongruent with the utilitarian principle, stakeholder theory, and principles of CSR, which suggest that the company has a duty to provide affordable medication. Ultimately, it is challenging to justify the exorbitant pricing of EpiPens as being wholly ethical or economically adequate. The ethical obligation to ensure affordability and access to life-saving medication appears to outweigh the economic rationale employed by Mylan. Moving forward, a balance must be struck between ensuring company profitability and fulfilling ethical responsibilities towards society. An evaluation of its pricing strategy in the context of broader access to healthcare and regulatory policies may provide insights into how Mylan and similar companies can align their economic objectives with ethical obligations. Recommendations 1. A pricing review should be considered by Mylan to better align with ethical standards and CSR principles. 2. Mylan may explore alternative strategies to recoup R&D investments, such as government subsidies or longer-term patent protections. 3. Universal healthcare coverage policies could be proposed to policymakers to mitigate the impact of high drug prices on consumers.

To perform a more elaborated Business Internal Assessment, here's an outline of how additional data could enhance the analysis: 1. **Costs and Break-even Analysis**: Actual costs associated with the production and distribution of EpiPens can be analyzed. This includes manufacturing costs, administrative expenses, R&D expenses, marketing, and distribution costs. Knowing the break-even point can determine if the pricing was indeed to simply cover costs and make a reasonable profit or if it was excessively above it. 2. **Elasticities and Market Demand**: Data on the price elasticity of demand for EpiPens can give insights into consumer responsiveness to price changes. Sales volumes at different price points along with substitutes availability would provide practical evidence for the evaluation of demand elasticity. 3. **Investment Appraisal**: Investigate the financial metrics such as Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and payback period based on R&D investment, to assess whether the price point is justified by the initial investment. 4. **Profit Margins and Shareholder Returns**: Analyzing Mylan’s profitability, including trend analysis of profits over the years and comparison with industry averages, can help discern whether the profits are excessive or in line with pharmaceutical industry norms. 5. **Stakeholder Impact Analysis**: Surveys, interviews, or case studies about individual customers or businesses affected by the EpiPen pricing can provide qualitative and quantitative data on the impact of pricing decisions. 6. **Regulatory Environment**: Information regarding any negotiations with governments or regulatory bodies, patents specifics, and the influence of such factors on pricing strategies. 7. **Ethical and CSR Considerations**: Public perception data from surveys or studies, and details on Mylan's CSR initiatives, can add to understanding whether their actions align with ethical business conduct. Given specific data points, you’ll be able to perform quantitative analyses such as constructing financial ratios, conducting trend analysis, or utilizing statistical tools like regression analysis to study the relationship between EpiPen pricing and company profitability, or other relevant variables. Remember to treat all provided data with critical thinking and evaluate it within the context of broader economic, ethical, and industry-specific conditions for a robust analysis in a Business IA. The IB Business and Management curriculum emphasizes not just the use of data, but also its critical evaluation in conjunction with theories and business concepts."},{"instruction":"Economic considerations in the treatment of systemic allergic reactions Emma Westermann-Clark,1,2 Amber N Pepper,1,2 and Richard F Lockey1,2 Author information Copyright and License information PMC Disclaimer Go to: Abstract Epinephrine is a life-saving medication used to treat systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) are expensive and worldwide availability is limited. Epinephrine prefilled syringes and epinephrine kits are potentially lower-cost alternatives to EAIs. Advantages, disadvantages, and costs of available products are discussed. The socioeconomic factors impacting access to EAIs are described. Keywords: epinephrine, anaphylaxis, cost, price, autoinjector Go to: Introduction Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for systemic allergic reactions (SARs) to foods, insect stings or bites, medications, and other allergens. The early use of epinephrine in SARs can be life-saving; delayed use has been associated with death.1–3 Cox et al updated the World Allergy Organization (WAO) grading system for SARs as summarized in Table 1 to clarify the early signs and symptoms of an SAR and to encourage early use of epinephrine.4 The term “SAR” applies to all grades with the term “anaphylaxis” also appropriate for grade 4 or 5 reactions. Table 1 Proposed modification of the 2010 World Allergy Organization grading system Grading system for SARs Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 Grade 5 Anaphylaxis Symptom(s)/sign(s) from 1 organ system present Cutaneous • Urticaria and/or erythema-warmth and/or pruritus, other than localized at the injection site And/or • Tingling, or itching of the lips* or • Angioedema (not laryngeal)* Or Upper respiratory • Nasal symptoms (eg, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, and/or nasal congestion) And/or • Throat-clearing (itchy throat)* And/or • Cough not related to bronchospasm Or Conjunctival • Erythema, pruritus, or tearing Or Other • Nausea • Metallic taste Symptom(s)/sign(s) from ≥2 organ symptoms listed in grade 1 Lower airway • Mild bronchospasm, eg, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath which responds to treatment And/or Gastrointestinal • Abdominal cramps* and/or vomiting/diarrhea Other • Uterine cramps • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grade 1 would be included Lower airway • Severe bronchospasm, eg, not responding or worsening in spite of treatment And/or Upper airway • Laryngeal edema with stridor • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grades 1 or 3 would be included Lower or upper airway • Respiratory failure And/or Cardiovascular • Collapse/hypotension^ And/or Loss of consciousness (vasovagal excluded) • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grades 1, 3, or 4 would be included Open in a separate window Notes: The final grade of the reaction is not determined until the event is over, regardless of the medication administered to treat the reaction. The final report should include the first symptom(s)/sign(s) and the time of onset after the causative agent exposure and a suffix reflecting if and when epinephrine was or was not administered: a, ≤5 min; b, >5 min to ≤10 min; c, >10 to ≤20 min; d, >20 min; z, epinephrine not administered. Final report: Grade 1-5; a-d, or z; First symptom(s)/sign(s); Time of onset of first symptom(s)/signs(s). Case example. Within 10 min of receiving an AIT injection, a patient develops generalized urticaria followed by a tickling sensation in the posterior pharynx. Intramuscular epinephrine is administered within 5 min of symptoms(s)/sign(s) resulting in complete resolution of the reaction. The final report would be: Grade 2; a; Urticaria; 10 min. *Application-site reactions would be considered local reactions. Oral mucosa symptoms, such as pruritus, after SLIT administration, or warmth and/or pruritus at a subcutaneous immunotherapy injection site would be considered a local reaction. However, tingling or itching of the lips or mouth could be interpreted as a SAR if the known allergen, eg, peanut, is inadvertently placed into the mouth or ingested in a subject with a history of a peanut-induced SAR. Gastrointestinal tract reactions after SLIT or OIT would also be considered local reactions, unless they occur with other systemic manifestations. SLIT or OIT reactions associated with gastrointestinal tract and other systemic manifestations would be classified as SARs. SLIT local reactions would be classified according to the WAO grading system for SLIT local reactions.33 A fatal reaction would not be classified in this grading system but rather reported as a serious adverse event. ^Hypotension is defined per the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Expert Panel criteria34: “Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours). A) Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic blood pressure. Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as follows: 1 mo to 1 y: <70 mm Hg, 1–10 y: <70 mm Hg + [2 × age], 11–17 y: <90 mm Hg. B) Adults: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline.

Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) were developed in the 1970s and were first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1987 with the EpiPen® (Mylan, Canonsburg, PA, USA). EAIs available in the USA include: EpiPen; epinephrine injection, United States Pharmacopeia autoinjector, generic (Mylan); epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector (Impax Generics, Hayward, CA, USA); and Auvi-Q® (Kaléo, Richmond, VA, USA). The annual direct costs in year 2010 in the USA for EAIs are estimated to be 294 million, accounting for about 25% of the 1.2 billion annual cost to treat SARs including anaphylaxis.5,6 The average wholesale price (AWP) of each EAI is included in Table 2, except for the Auvi-Q. Accurate wholesale pricing for the Auvi-Q is not available as it is distributed through a single specialty pharmacy network. The complexity of drug pricing is beyond the scope of this article. Costs for the EpiPen were relatively stable until Mylan acquired this product from Merck (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) in 2007. The AWP since that time for two EpiPens has increased 545% from 113.27 to 730.33.4 This price increase persists even after accounting for inflation (Figure 1).7,8 Although the out-of-pocket expenses for individual subjects may have decreased since the public outcry about EpiPen costs in 2016, the effective date of the most recent AWP available is May 16, 2016 and does not reflect the impact of price cuts or patient assistance programs.7 An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is jaa-11-153Fig1.jpg Figure 1 AWP for the EpiPen® 2001–2016.

Abbreviations: AWP, average wholesale price; ea, each; NDC: national drug code. Use of the AWP is controversial, but it is often used as a proxy for societal cost in cost-effectiveness analyses.9 An economic analysis published in 2011 utilized the 2006–2007 AWP of the EpiPen to estimate the annual cost of EAIs for food-induced SARs.10 According to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research good research practices guidelines from 2010: Pharmaceutical prices used in the vast majority of cost-effectiveness analyses are either based on AWPs in the USA or government-negotiated prices in Europe. The former are not only imperfect measures of actual prices paid (e.g., ignoring discounts and rebates), but may also greatly overestimate societal opportunity costs because of the implicit inclusion of producer surplus created through patent-protected monopoly pricing.11 In summary, AWP is used as an approximation for societal drug costs, despite its limitations. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) discusses the challenge of determining medication costs for research purposes. The HERC states, “We recommend using 121% of the drug costs reported in the Federal Supply Schedule, 152% of the VA cost, or 64% of AWP. To find the cost of a generic label prescription drug, we recommend using 27% of AWP.”9 Federal Supply Schedule prices are publicly available.12 Several factors limit the ability of newer products to garner and maintain a better market share versus Mylan’s EpiPen. First, the EpiPen has name recognition. Second, training for the use of each device is different. To illustrate, the epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector from Impax Generics requires the removal of two caps rather than just one. Although learning to use a new device can be challenging, novel design elements can improve safety and usability. An example is that the Auvi-Q has unique features including its rectangular shape intended to fit into a pocket, a retractable needle, and voice instructions. Third, insurance coverage differs for each EAI. According to the Managed Markets Insight and Technology database, the EpiPen has unrestricted access for 61% of commercial lives among 4624 commercial health plans.13 In contrast, Auvi-Q has unrestricted access for “19% of commercial lives in all locations” among these same commercial health plans.8 Even though Auvi-Q is not covered by many commercial insurance plans, the manufacturer offers it with 0 copayment to all commercially insured and Medicaid patients through a specialty pharmacy network distributor. Fourth, EAIs are rated “BX” by the FDA indicating that “data that have been reviewed by the Agency are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence” and when ordered may not be substituted by a pharmacist, one for another.14 The impact of copayments, coupons, and patient assistance programs on prices that subjects pay at the pharmacy counter requires further research. Pourang et al found that copayments did not affect the likelihood of an EAI being dispensed once it was prescribed in the Kaiser Permanente Health Maintenance Organization.15 However, while the authors indicate that nearly 30% of copayments exceeded 30, they did not consider higher copayments. Data are not available on prescription:dispense ratios for subjects with exceedingly high copayments or for uninsured and underinsured subjects who may pay retail prices. More than 50% of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned or not filled when the cost exceeds 300 for a 2-pack.5 Two generic EAIs manufactured by Mylan have an AWP of 375. Two generic EAIs manufactured by Impax Generics have an AWP of 494.01. Patients with any commercial insurance plan or Medicaid receive Auvi-Q for 0 copayment through the specialty pharmacy network, ASPN Pharmacies LLC (200 Park Avenue, Suite 300, Florham Park, NJ 07932, 973-295-3289). All uninsured subjects who make <100,000 annually have no copayment for Auvi-Q; uninsured subjects whose incomes exceed 100,000 pay no more than 360 for Auvi-Q. Socioeconomic factors impact access to EAIs. Children from high-income versus low-income homes are 8.35 times more likely to be prescribed EAIs.16 Medicaid-enrolled children are less likely to receive EAIs prior to arrival at an emergency department.17 In another study, Caucasian versus non-Caucasian children were more likely to receive epinephrine early during an SAR.18 Early use of epinephrine was defined as epinephrine administered before arrival to the emergency department. Owning an EAI greatly increased the odds of early epinephrine treatment (odds ratio 12.67, 95% CI: 4.46–35.96). The authors did not assess insurance status but indicate that this finding suggests that there might be an economic influence on access to EAIs.18 Fleming et al examined the out-of-pocket costs for medications associated with food allergy and found higher costs for Caucasian and higher-income subjects.18 They hypothesize that Medicaid-enrolled children may have lower out-of-pocket costs, that is, lower copayments. To reduce or eliminate insurance copayments, Fromer suggests that epinephrine be classified as a preventive medicine by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).5 Decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro, Williamstown, MA, USA) has been used to evaluate the cost of generic EAIs versus the EpiPen using a model that tracked spending for individual subjects over 20 years, with the assumption that each subject needs two 2-packs yearly, one each for home and school or work.19 The cost for the EpiPen over a 20-year model duration totals 58,667 (95% CI: 57,745–59,588) versus 45,588 for the generic EAI (95% CI: 44,873–46,304). The model also incorporates other food allergy-related costs, such as specialist visits, grocery costs, and loss of work time for parents of food-allergic children. These costs are assumed to be the same for all subjects regardless of the type of EAI prescribed. The price of EAIs also affects school districts and communities. The Michigan legislature mandated that all public schools stock EAIs. It estimated the cost for two EAI 2-packs, one adult and one pediatric, at 140, while the “recently reported costs for commercial sources” was 1200, according to the authors of the article. The annual calculated cost to Michigan public schools based on these two cost estimates ranges from 565,460 to 4,846,800.20 A 2007 WAO survey of its House of Delegates indicates that EAIs are available in 59% of 44 countries surveyed.21 Those without EAIs employed other methods for the self-administration of epinephrine.22 These include the use of ampules of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) with an empty 1 cc syringe to be drawn up as needed or prefilled syringes containing various amounts of epinephrine. Both options are much less expensive than EAIs; for example, a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) had an AWP of 2.52 and retail price of ~12 in 2016.7 Epinephrine ampules may not be available in all countries. Both options also allow for tailored dosing of epinephrine, above or below the standard 0.15 or 0.3 mg doses contained in most FDA-approved EAIs. This may be beneficial for children weighing <15 kg (33 pounds) or for large or obese subjects. Of note, in November 2017, the FDA approved an infant version of the Auvi-Q, Auvi-q 0.1mg, for children weighing 7.5–15 kg (16.5–33 pounds). It has a shorter needle and a smaller dose of epinephrine (0.1 mg versus 0.15 mg contained in other “junior” products). Market forces appear to influence the cost of EAIs. For example, some US companies are offering low-cost alternatives. Symjepi™ (Adamis, San Diego, CA, USA) is an epinephrine prefilled syringe (EPS) that contains 0.3 mg of epinephrine, with a user-friendly design. It was approved by the FDA in June 2017 for subjects 30 kg (66 pounds) or more and is expected to be available at a lower cost than the current EAIs. A “junior” version is expected to follow. The concept of prefilled syringes is not new. The Ana-Kit® (Hollister-Stier Laboratories, Spokane, WA, USA) consisted of a syringe filled with 1 mL of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) housed in a protective case for subcutaneous injection before it was removed from the US market.23,24 The Ana-Kit syringe had 0.1 mL graduations so that smaller doses could be administered depending on the subject’s age. The instructions recommended the following doses: “Adults and children over 12 years: 0.3 mL; 6–12 years: 0.2 mL; 2–6 years: 0.15 mL; infants to 2 years: 0.05–0.1 mL.”25 An appropriate dose could be administered by pushing the syringe plunger until it stopped. A second dose could be administered as appropriate, after rotating the rectangular plunger ¼ turn to the right, to line up with a rectangular slot in the syringe.25 An advantage of the prefilled Symjepi syringe is that it is housed in a dark blue plastic encasement to protect the epinephrine from ultraviolet light degradation. Epinephrine degrades with exposure to ultraviolet light, oxygen in ambient air, and excessive heat.26–28 EPSs stored at room temperature in a pencil box maintain acceptable US Pharmacopeia concentrations (90%–115% of label claim), pH, and sterility for 3 months.22 The stability is limited to 2 months in high-temperature and low-humidity climates.22,29 In addition, some physicians and other health care professionals provide subjects with prefilled syringes wrapped in aluminum foil.28,30 These can be transported in a crush-resistant eyeglass case. Snap Medical Industries (Dubin, OH, USA) has developed EpinephrineSnap-V® (a kit containing a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes) and the EpinephrineSnap convenience kit (a kit containing an ampule of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes). The Focus Health Group, located in Knoxville, TN, USA, has been contracted to commercialize these products. The AWP of this product is 1567 although information from company officials states that the average price of EpinephrineSnap is 80 and the EpinephrineSnap-V is 130, with discounted group purchasing organization pricing available (Personal communication, November 1, 2017). Use of these options may not be as practical as is an EAI. The reason is that an epinephrine ampule or vial with an empty syringe requires more skill to properly draw up the epinephrine and administer it under emergency circumstances. Parents of individuals with a history of an SAR take longer to draw up epinephrine from an ampule (average 142±13 seconds) compared to emergency department nurses (29±0.09 seconds; p<0.05).31 The epinephrine dose drawn up by parents also ranged 40-fold as compared to twofold for emergency department nurses.31 The EpinephrineSnap products are geared toward use by emergency medical technicians and other health care professionals rather than individual subjects. The rising cost of EAIs has made self-administered epinephrine potentially unavailable to some subjects. There are no data on deaths attributed to inability to afford EAIs. Lower-cost alternatives such as EPSs and epinephrine kits are entering the US market. EAIs have advantages, such as ease of use, but they are expensive. More research is needed on the complexity of drug pricing and on the optimal methods to determine individual and societal costs. Classifying EAIs as USPSTF preventive medicines could improve access by reducing or eliminating copayments. Second source: Viatris Agrees to Settle EpiPen Antitrust Litigation for 264 Million The proposed settlement, which requires a judge’s approval, would resolve a legal battle that began after the company, in 2016, raised the price for two EpiPens to 608 from 100. Share full article In 2016, Viatris, then known as Mylan, raised the price for two EpiPens to 608 from 100, according to court documents.Credit...Andrew Mangum for The New York Times Jesus Jiménez By Jesus Jiménez Feb. 28, 2022 Viatris, the drugmaker previously known as Mylan, announced on Monday that it had agreed to pay 264 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that alleged the company was involved in an illegal scheme to monopolize the market for epinephrine auto-injector devices known as EpiPens, which are used to treat severe allergic reactions. The proposed settlement, which needs to be approved by a judge, would resolve a legal battle that began after Mylan, in 2016, raised the price for a pack of two EpiPens to 608 from 100, the price since 2007, according to court documents. In the lawsuit, a group of plaintiffs made up of consumers, health insurance companies and other third-party payers alleged that by drastically raising the price of EpiPens, the drugmaker was “unlawfully exercising its monopoly power,” according to a complaint. “Were the price increases attributable to market conditions, increases in manufacturing costs or shortages in the supply of epinephrine?” the complaint said. “Absolutely not. They were driven solely by unaccountable executives and companies who sought to profit off of human misery and fear.” Many people involved in the lawsuit had paid thousands of dollars for EpiPens over the years, including a mother from Arizona who had paid 2,475 out of pocket for her son who is allergic to tree nuts and peanuts, and a father from Delaware who spent more than 1,100 on EpiPens for his son who is allergic to milk, eggs and peanuts, according to the lawsuit. EpiPens are made by two subsidiaries of Pfizer — King Pharmaceuticals and Meridian Medical Technologies — and are sold by Viatris. In July, Pfizer and its subsidiaries settled its part of the lawsuit for 345 million, and denied any wrongdoing. In its quarterly earnings report on Monday, Viatris said that the company “maintains that it acted lawfully and pro-competitively and the settlement contains no admission of liability.” “The board of directors believes that this settlement is in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders,” the report said. “The resolution of these indirect purchaser cases will allow the company to move forward and continue focusing on its strategic priorities and its mission of empowering people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life.” Editors’ Picks Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos Have Nothing and Everything in Common The Wild Beauty of Moss Is It OK to Send Condolence Notes to Strangers? Neither Viatris officials nor lawyers representing the company immediately responded to a request for comment on Monday night. Our business reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover. Lynn Sarko, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement that he urged consumers and third-party payers who paid for EpiPens to learn more about the settlement at a website where claims can be filed. “We are pleased that the EpiPen antitrust litigation is now concluded,” Paul Geller, another lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement, adding that the settlement is subject to court approval. The lawsuit also alleged that the drugmaker misclassified EpiPens under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to save hundreds of millions of dollars in rebates, and that it intervened in regulatory proceedings to delay competitors from entering the market. The price jump in 2016 drew widespread outrage, especially among parents of children with allergies. Thousands of people signed a petition urging Congress to intervene. After protests over the company’s raising the price of EpiPens in 2016, Mylan, as Viatris was then known, introduced a generic version of its own product. But it was announced with a wholesale list price of 300 for a pack of two, half the price of the brand-name EpiPen. In 2016, Mylan reached a 465 million settlement with the Justice Department and other government agencies over allegations that the drugmaker had overcharged Medicaid for the treatment by improperly classifying it as a generic drug. Third source: As the CEO of the drug maker that sells the EpiPen allergy-reaction injector defended the company’s six-fold price increases before Congress last week, it’s appalling to see that Heather Bresch took no fault. The company’s price hikes on a life-saving drug is clearly unethical if we take a closer look. EpiPen has gone from 100 for a two-pack in 2009 to 608 today. Usually, companies would be applauded for the ability to create revenue through such pricing power. But when it comes to life-saving drugs, consumers interpret these significant increases as the producer profiteering off a person’s life or death need. This is (not) unlike what happened at Turing Pharmaceuticals last year when the company increased the price of Daraprim from roughly 15 to 750. Like many, I had to ask: are these prices ethical? In the book, The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably, the authors present a five-step test to determine if a price is ethical. Here’s a look at how Mylan’s Epipens would perform under the test: Test #1: the exchange (transaction) is ethical when the price is paid voluntarily. The buyer is aware of how much the item costs and voluntarily completes the transaction. For this level, Mylan has passed at an elementary understanding. People are still buying EpiPens. Test #2: The buyer is provided ample information about the product. This expectation comes with any purchase. The seller is not misleading consumers or omitting crucial information. Smokers still purchase cigarettes, despite the full disclosure of health risks. For this level, Mylan still passes the test. Test #3 and #4 are not as simple, so let’s come back to them later in this article. Test #5: The exchange must present equal access to goods regardless of ability to cover the cost. Consumers have access to discounts based on financial need and Mylan also provides free EpiPens to schools and funds activities related to allergy awareness. They continue to pass the test for now. OK, now let’s get back to Test #3 and #4. Here is where consumer outrage and the case for unethical behavior becomes stronger. Test #3: This stipulates that sellers cannot exploit a buyer’s essential needs. Test #4: This states the price must be justified by costs. There should be no excessive, unjustified profits on essentials. For example, if a person was having a heart attack and needed emergency treatment, hospitals would first treat the patient before collecting a deposit upfront to ensure the patient can pay for their services. In 2011, the list price for the EpiPen was 165. At that time, there were no competitors in the market and the product was off patent, meaning the patent protection had expired. Further, there was consistent demand due to the product’s shelf life of one year. Customers had to replace their EpiPens annually. In 2012, the list price increased 32% with no new competitors entering the market. However, this increase could have resulted from more R&D spending or an increase in raw materials costs. Regardless, the price was elastic and consumers continued to purchase the drug. By 2013, Sanofi announced its entry into the market. Their price hovered near that of Mylan’s, so it would appear the price was justified by cost. Had Sanofi entered with a lower or higher price, this justification would have been tougher to sell. Mylan responded by increasing their price a little more, which likely came from a desire to differentiate themselves as the premier brand with superior products. At this point, Mylan was still within the ethical constraints put forth above. This changed when Sanofi, Mylan’s sole competitor, was forced into a product recall and left the market. Mylan once again had a monopoly. Typically, in this situation, the price would remain the same or increase nominally with inflation and other standard considerations. Instead, Mylan increased the price from 300 to 600 over two years. In 2015, Mylan reported a net profit margin of 8.9%, but some speculate the margin for the EpiPen was closer to 55%, thus breaking the ethical constraints of Test #3 and #4. While individual consumers may not have had a voice or recourse, the market did. Mylan may have improved its margins and ultimately driven higher returns and shareholder value, but within a week the price increase cost the company 3 billion in market cap and a stock tank of over 12% in 5 days. They attempted to rectify the issue and announced a generic brand of the EpiPen with a list price of 300. Because of this misstep, though, every price change now will come under extreme scrutiny. The ethics of pricing is a minefield for any company to navigate. Nominal price increases are annoyances to customers and consumers, but they—for the most part—will not be met with extreme criticism. As long as a company is transparent about price increases and can demonstrate that such a change is justified—or at least has the consumers’ faith that this is true—they should be able to avoid a public maelstrom. If the Mylan debacle demonstrates anything, it shows that even in markets that have little pricing regulation and transparency, pricing moves must be carefully considered and communicated in a way that demonstrates ethical behavior in the best interest of both the consumer and the company.

This internal assessment examines the extent to which these price increases by Mylan N.V., now known as Viatris, are justifiable from an economic and ethical perspective, drawing upon concepts from the International Baccalaureate (IB) Business and Management curriculum. The analysis leverages recent data and case studies to explore the impacts on consumers, the healthcare system, and the company's strategic decisions. Economic Considerations (500 words) Economic theories relevant to the pricing of EpiPens include market structures, price elasticity, cost analysis, and investment appraisal. Mylan's pricing strategy employs a monopoly-like dominance, enabling them to significantly raise prices without losing market share. The inelastic demand for EpiPens, given their role as a life-saving treatment for anaphylaxis with few substitutes, has afforded Mylan the pricing power analyzed under Elasticities (IB Business and Management, Chapter 2.1). The price of an EpiPen has escalated from 100 for a two-pack in 2007 to 608 in 2016, a 545% increase that significantly surpasses inflation-adjusted growth (Viatris Agrees to Settle EpiPen Antitrust Litigation for 264 Million, 2022). Despite Mylan's purported investment in R&D and marketing efforts, the direct correlation between these expenditures and such exorbitant price hikes remains unclear, warranting an assessment under Costs and Break-even Analysis (Chapter 1.6.2). The lack of competitive pressure has compounded this issue, as indicated by Sanofi's market exit and FDA's \\"BX\\" rating for EAIs preventing substitution by pharmacists, limiting market forces that could naturally constrain prices (Economic considerations in the treatment of systemic allergic reactions, 2017). Considering the cost structures reported, Mylan's actual production and distribution costs compared to the final market price suggest a significant discrepancy, likely resulting in high profit margins, a notion supported by reports of net profit margins close to 55% for the EpiPen, substantially higher than the overall company margin of 8.9% (As the CEO of the drug maker that sells the EpiPen allergy-reaction injector defended the company’s six-fold price increases before Congress last week, it’s appalling to see that Heather Bresch took no fault, n.d.). This calls into question the ethicality and economic justification of the pricing strategy, as Investment Appraisal (Chapter 1.6.3) should also account for the social cost and the company's corporate responsibilities, not solely financial returns. Ethical Considerations (500 words) Ethical analysis of EpiPen pricing aligns with concepts of business ethics, stakeholder impact, and corporate social responsibility as outlined in the IB Business and Management syllabus (Chapter 2.3). The price escalation of a life-saving product raises ethical concerns under Business Ethics, questioning whether it's morally defensible to profit extensively from a health necessity. Mylan's pricing practices appear to conflict with the Utilitarianism principle, suggesting actions should result in the greatest good for the greatest number. Subsequent public outcry and legal action imply a neglect of Stakeholders' interests, particularly consumers faced with potential life and death situations due to the prohibitive costs (Business and Management for the IB Diploma, 2nd Edition). The widening gap in access to EpiPens based on socioeconomic status further highlights disparities elicited by these pricing decisions. Corporate Social Responsibility considerations suggest that Mylan's strategy has not been entirely aligned with societal expectations and the ethical provision of essential medications. The company's response to public outrage through the introduction of generic versions of its product and patient assistance programs is an attempt to mitigate reputational damage, yet it does not offset the fundamental ethical concern inherent in the initial pricing decisions. Considering the wider economic impact, the high AWP of EpiPens imposes significant costs on public institutions such as schools and healthcare systems, potentially reducing funds available for other services. This further accentuates the need for a balanced approach that reconciles profitability with public welfare. Conclusion and Recommendations (400 words) The assessment of Mylan's EpiPen pricing strategy indicates a concerning disparity between economic justification and ethical standards. While monopolistic market structures and inelastic demand provided the economic basis for price increases, the ethical implications regarding access to life-saving medication and the preferential treatment of stakeholder interests (particularly shareholders) cannot be overlooked. The stark increase in EpiPen prices, lack of transparent justification in terms of R&D and production costs, and the subsequent societal impact suggest that Mylan's pricing strategy was neither economically adequate nor ethically sound. The high-profit margins garnered at the expense of consumer accessibility have provoked legal, economic, and ethical scrutiny. For a business, it is imperative to strike an equilibrium that respects both economic imperatives and ethical responsibilities. This is especially relevant in industries that deal with life-critical products. Mylan's case illustrates the complexities that arise when profit motives overshadow critical health needs, reinforcing the necessity for vigilant regulatory oversight and robust ethical business standards. With regard to action, the following recommendations are proposed: 1. Mylan/Viatris ought to adopt more transparent pricing reflecting actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin to re-establish trust and ethical integrity. 2. Policymakers should examine regulatory reforms to foster competition and ensure affordable access to essential medications, perhaps classifying life-saving drugs like EpiPens under USPSTF preventive medications category to improve access and affordability. 3. Mylan/Viatris should extend their CSR efforts, deepening their engagement in community-based initiatives and industry collaborations to improve the affordability and availability of life-saving medications. The business practices surrounding EpiPen pricing illustrate the delicate balance between economic strategy and ethical responsibility. It is clear that steps must be taken by both the company and regulators to ensure that life-saving treatments remain accessible to all segments of society without undue financial burden.

Sin embargo, en caso de tener otros factores de riesgo como obesidad, antecedentes familiares de hipertensión o enfermedad renal, se puede recomendar un monitoreo más frecuente. La presión arterial se mide en milímetros de mercurio (mmHg). Se toman dos valores: la presión arterial sistólica (el número superior) y la presión arterial diastólica (el número inferior). Ejemplo: 120/80 mmHg. Es importante destacar que el control de la presión arterial en personas diabéticas es fundamental para prevenir complicaciones como enfermedades del corazón, derrames cerebrales y enfermedad renal.

Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) are expensive and worldwide availability is limited. Epinephrine prefilled syringes and epinephrine kits are potentially lower-cost alternatives to EAIs. Advantages, disadvantages, and costs of available products are discussed. The socioeconomic factors impacting access to EAIs are described. Keywords: epinephrine, anaphylaxis, cost, price, autoinjector Go to: Introduction Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for systemic allergic reactions (SARs) to foods, insect stings or bites, medications, and other allergens. The early use of epinephrine in SARs can be life-saving; delayed use has been associated with death.1–3 Cox et al updated the World Allergy Organization (WAO) grading system for SARs as summarized in Table 1 to clarify the early signs and symptoms of an SAR and to encourage early use of epinephrine.4 The term “SAR” applies to all grades with the term “anaphylaxis” also appropriate for grade 4 or 5 reactions. Table 1 Proposed modification of the 2010 World Allergy Organization grading system Grading system for SARs Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 Grade 5 Anaphylaxis Symptom(s)/sign(s) from 1 organ system present Cutaneous • Urticaria and/or erythema-warmth and/or pruritus, other than localized at the injection site And/or • Tingling, or itching of the lips* or • Angioedema (not laryngeal) Or Upper respiratory • Nasal symptoms (eg, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, and/or nasal congestion) And/or • Throat-clearing (itchy throat) And/or • Cough not related to bronchospasm Or Conjunctival • Erythema, pruritus, or tearing Or Other • Nausea • Metallic taste Symptom(s)/sign(s) from ≥2 organ symptoms listed in grade 1 Lower airway • Mild bronchospasm, eg, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath which responds to treatment And/or Gastrointestinal • Abdominal cramps* and/or vomiting/diarrhea Other • Uterine cramps • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grade 1 would be included Lower airway • Severe bronchospasm, eg, not responding or worsening in spite of treatment And/or Upper airway • Laryngeal edema with stridor • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grades 1 or 3 would be included Lower or upper airway • Respiratory failure And/or Cardiovascular • Collapse/hypotension^ And/or Loss of consciousness (vasovagal excluded) • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grades 1, 3, or 4 would be included Open in a separate window Notes: The final grade of the reaction is not determined until the event is over, regardless of the medication administered to treat the reaction. The final report should include the first symptom(s)/sign(s) and the time of onset after the causative agent exposure and a suffix reflecting if and when epinephrine was or was not administered: a, ≤5 min; b, >5 min to ≤10 min; c, >10 to ≤20 min; d, >20 min; z, epinephrine not administered. Final report: Grade 1-5; a-d, or z; First symptom(s)/sign(s); Time of onset of first symptom(s)/signs(s). Case example. Within 10 min of receiving an AIT injection, a patient develops generalized urticaria followed by a tickling sensation in the posterior pharynx. Intramuscular epinephrine is administered within 5 min of symptoms(s)/sign(s) resulting in complete resolution of the reaction. The final report would be: Grade 2; a; Urticaria; 10 min. *Application-site reactions would be considered local reactions. Oral mucosa symptoms, such as pruritus, after SLIT administration, or warmth and/or pruritus at a subcutaneous immunotherapy injection site would be considered a local reaction. However, tingling or itching of the lips or mouth could be interpreted as a SAR if the known allergen, eg, peanut, is inadvertently placed into the mouth or ingested in a subject with a history of a peanut-induced SAR. Gastrointestinal tract reactions after SLIT or OIT would also be considered local reactions, unless they occur with other systemic manifestations. SLIT or OIT reactions associated with gastrointestinal tract and other systemic manifestations would be classified as SARs. SLIT local reactions would be classified according to the WAO grading system for SLIT local reactions.33 A fatal reaction would not be classified in this grading system but rather reported as a serious adverse event. ^Hypotension is defined per the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Expert Panel criteria34: “Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours). A) Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic blood pressure. Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as follows: 1 mo to 1 y: <70 mm Hg, 1–10 y: <70 mm Hg + [2 × age], 11–17 y: <90 mm Hg. B) Adults: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline.

Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) were developed in the 1970s and were first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1987 with the EpiPen® (Mylan, Canonsburg, PA, USA). EAIs available in the USA include: EpiPen; epinephrine injection, United States Pharmacopeia autoinjector, generic (Mylan); epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector (Impax Generics, Hayward, CA, USA); and Auvi-Q® (Kaléo, Richmond, VA, USA). The annual direct costs in year 2010 in the USA for EAIs are estimated to be 294 million, accounting for about 25% of the 1.2 billion annual cost to treat SARs including anaphylaxis.5,6 The average wholesale price (AWP) of each EAI is included in Table 2, except for the Auvi-Q. Accurate wholesale pricing for the Auvi-Q is not available as it is distributed through a single specialty pharmacy network. The complexity of drug pricing is beyond the scope of this article. Costs for the EpiPen were relatively stable until Mylan acquired this product from Merck (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) in 2007. The AWP since that time for two EpiPens has increased 545% from 113.27 to 730.33.4 This price increase persists even after accounting for inflation (Figure 1).7,8 Although the out-of-pocket expenses for individual subjects may have decreased since the public outcry about EpiPen costs in 2016, the effective date of the most recent AWP available is May 16, 2016 and does not reflect the impact of price cuts or patient assistance programs.7 An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is jaa-11-153Fig1.jpg Figure 1 AWP for the EpiPen® 2001–2016.

Abbreviations: AWP, average wholesale price; ea, each; NDC: national drug code. Use of the AWP is controversial, but it is often used as a proxy for societal cost in cost-effectiveness analyses.9 An economic analysis published in 2011 utilized the 2006–2007 AWP of the EpiPen to estimate the annual cost of EAIs for food-induced SARs.10 According to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research good research practices guidelines from 2010: Pharmaceutical prices used in the vast majority of cost-effectiveness analyses are either based on AWPs in the USA or government-negotiated prices in Europe. The former are not only imperfect measures of actual prices paid (e.g., ignoring discounts and rebates), but may also greatly overestimate societal opportunity costs because of the implicit inclusion of producer surplus created through patent-protected monopoly pricing.11 In summary, AWP is used as an approximation for societal drug costs, despite its limitations. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) discusses the challenge of determining medication costs for research purposes. The HERC states, “We recommend using 121% of the drug costs reported in the Federal Supply Schedule, 152% of the VA cost, or 64% of AWP. To find the cost of a generic label prescription drug, we recommend using 27% of AWP.”9 Federal Supply Schedule prices are publicly available.12 Several factors limit the ability of newer products to garner and maintain a better market share versus Mylan’s EpiPen. First, the EpiPen has name recognition. Second, training for the use of each device is different. To illustrate, the epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector from Impax Generics requires the removal of two caps rather than just one. Although learning to use a new device can be challenging, novel design elements can improve safety and usability. An example is that the Auvi-Q has unique features including its rectangular shape intended to fit into a pocket, a retractable needle, and voice instructions. Third, insurance coverage differs for each EAI. According to the Managed Markets Insight and Technology database, the EpiPen has unrestricted access for 61% of commercial lives among 4624 commercial health plans.13 In contrast, Auvi-Q has unrestricted access for “19% of commercial lives in all locations” among these same commercial health plans.8 Even though Auvi-Q is not covered by many commercial insurance plans, the manufacturer offers it with 0 copayment to all commercially insured and Medicaid patients through a specialty pharmacy network distributor. Fourth, EAIs are rated “BX” by the FDA indicating that “data that have been reviewed by the Agency are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence” and when ordered may not be substituted by a pharmacist, one for another.14 The impact of copayments, coupons, and patient assistance programs on prices that subjects pay at the pharmacy counter requires further research. Pourang et al found that copayments did not affect the likelihood of an EAI being dispensed once it was prescribed in the Kaiser Permanente Health Maintenance Organization.15 However, while the authors indicate that nearly 30% of copayments exceeded 30, they did not consider higher copayments. Data are not available on prescription:dispense ratios for subjects with exceedingly high copayments or for uninsured and underinsured subjects who may pay retail prices. More than 50% of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned or not filled when the cost exceeds 300 for a 2-pack.5 Two generic EAIs manufactured by Mylan have an AWP of 375. Two generic EAIs manufactured by Impax Generics have an AWP of 494.01. Patients with any commercial insurance plan or Medicaid receive Auvi-Q for 0 copayment through the specialty pharmacy network, ASPN Pharmacies LLC (200 Park Avenue, Suite 300, Florham Park, NJ 07932, 973-295-3289). All uninsured subjects who make <100,000 annually have no copayment for Auvi-Q; uninsured subjects whose incomes exceed 100,000 pay no more than 360 for Auvi-Q. Socioeconomic factors impact access to EAIs. Children from high-income versus low-income homes are 8.35 times more likely to be prescribed EAIs.16 Medicaid-enrolled children are less likely to receive EAIs prior to arrival at an emergency department.17 In another study, Caucasian versus non-Caucasian children were more likely to receive epinephrine early during an SAR.18 Early use of epinephrine was defined as epinephrine administered before arrival to the emergency department. Owning an EAI greatly increased the odds of early epinephrine treatment (odds ratio 12.67, 95% CI: 4.46–35.96). The authors did not assess insurance status but indicate that this finding suggests that there might be an economic influence on access to EAIs.18 Fleming et al examined the out-of-pocket costs for medications associated with food allergy and found higher costs for Caucasian and higher-income subjects.18 They hypothesize that Medicaid-enrolled children may have lower out-of-pocket costs, that is, lower copayments. To reduce or eliminate insurance copayments, Fromer suggests that epinephrine be classified as a preventive medicine by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).5 Decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro, Williamstown, MA, USA) has been used to evaluate the cost of generic EAIs versus the EpiPen using a model that tracked spending for individual subjects over 20 years, with the assumption that each subject needs two 2-packs yearly, one each for home and school or work.19 The cost for the EpiPen over a 20-year model duration totals 58,667 (95% CI: 57,745–59,588) versus 45,588 for the generic EAI (95% CI: 44,873–46,304). The model also incorporates other food allergy-related costs, such as specialist visits, grocery costs, and loss of work time for parents of food-allergic children. These costs are assumed to be the same for all subjects regardless of the type of EAI prescribed. The price of EAIs also affects school districts and communities. The Michigan legislature mandated that all public schools stock EAIs. It estimated the cost for two EAI 2-packs, one adult and one pediatric, at 140, while the “recently reported costs for commercial sources” was 1200, according to the authors of the article. The annual calculated cost to Michigan public schools based on these two cost estimates ranges from 565,460 to 4,846,800.20 A 2007 WAO survey of its House of Delegates indicates that EAIs are available in 59% of 44 countries surveyed.21 Those without EAIs employed other methods for the self-administration of epinephrine.22 These include the use of ampules of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) with an empty 1 cc syringe to be drawn up as needed or prefilled syringes containing various amounts of epinephrine. Both options are much less expensive than EAIs; for example, a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) had an AWP of 2.52 and retail price of ~12 in 2016.7 Epinephrine ampules may not be available in all countries. Both options also allow for tailored dosing of epinephrine, above or below the standard 0.15 or 0.3 mg doses contained in most FDA-approved EAIs. This may be beneficial for children weighing <15 kg (33 pounds) or for large or obese subjects. Of note, in November 2017, the FDA approved an infant version of the Auvi-Q, Auvi-q 0.1mg, for children weighing 7.5–15 kg (16.5–33 pounds). It has a shorter needle and a smaller dose of epinephrine (0.1 mg versus 0.15 mg contained in other “junior” products). Market forces appear to influence the cost of EAIs. For example, some US companies are offering low-cost alternatives. Symjepi™ (Adamis, San Diego, CA, USA) is an epinephrine prefilled syringe (EPS) that contains 0.3 mg of epinephrine, with a user-friendly design. It was approved by the FDA in June 2017 for subjects 30 kg (66 pounds) or more and is expected to be available at a lower cost than the current EAIs. A “junior” version is expected to follow. The concept of prefilled syringes is not new. The Ana-Kit® (Hollister-Stier Laboratories, Spokane, WA, USA) consisted of a syringe filled with 1 mL of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) housed in a protective case for subcutaneous injection before it was removed from the US market.23,24 The Ana-Kit syringe had 0.1 mL graduations so that smaller doses could be administered depending on the subject’s age. The instructions recommended the following doses: “Adults and children over 12 years: 0.3 mL; 6–12 years: 0.2 mL; 2–6 years: 0.15 mL; infants to 2 years: 0.05–0.1 mL.”25 An appropriate dose could be administered by pushing the syringe plunger until it stopped. A second dose could be administered as appropriate, after rotating the rectangular plunger ¼ turn to the right, to line up with a rectangular slot in the syringe.25 An advantage of the prefilled Symjepi syringe is that it is housed in a dark blue plastic encasement to protect the epinephrine from ultraviolet light degradation. Epinephrine degrades with exposure to ultraviolet light, oxygen in ambient air, and excessive heat.26–28 EPSs stored at room temperature in a pencil box maintain acceptable US Pharmacopeia concentrations (90%–115% of label claim), pH, and sterility for 3 months.22 The stability is limited to 2 months in high-temperature and low-humidity climates.22,29 In addition, some physicians and other health care professionals provide subjects with prefilled syringes wrapped in aluminum foil.28,30 These can be transported in a crush-resistant eyeglass case. Snap Medical Industries (Dubin, OH, USA) has developed EpinephrineSnap-V® (a kit containing a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes) and the EpinephrineSnap convenience kit (a kit containing an ampule of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes). The Focus Health Group, located in Knoxville, TN, USA, has been contracted to commercialize these products. The AWP of this product is 1567 although information from company officials states that the average price of EpinephrineSnap is 80 and the EpinephrineSnap-V is 130, with discounted group purchasing organization pricing available (Personal communication, November 1, 2017). Use of these options may not be as practical as is an EAI. The reason is that an epinephrine ampule or vial with an empty syringe requires more skill to properly draw up the epinephrine and administer it under emergency circumstances. Parents of individuals with a history of an SAR take longer to draw up epinephrine from an ampule (average 142±13 seconds) compared to emergency department nurses (29±0.09 seconds; p<0.05).31 The epinephrine dose drawn up by parents also ranged 40-fold as compared to twofold for emergency department nurses.31 The EpinephrineSnap products are geared toward use by emergency medical technicians and other health care professionals rather than individual subjects. The rising cost of EAIs has made self-administered epinephrine potentially unavailable to some subjects. There are no data on deaths attributed to inability to afford EAIs. Lower-cost alternatives such as EPSs and epinephrine kits are entering the US market. EAIs have advantages, such as ease of use, but they are expensive. More research is needed on the complexity of drug pricing and on the optimal methods to determine individual and societal costs. Classifying EAIs as USPSTF preventive medicines could improve access by reducing or eliminating copayments. Second source: Viatris Agrees to Settle EpiPen Antitrust Litigation for 264 Million The proposed settlement, which requires a judge’s approval, would resolve a legal battle that began after the company, in 2016, raised the price for two EpiPens to 608 from 100. Share full article In 2016, Viatris, then known as Mylan, raised the price for two EpiPens to 608 from 100, according to court documents.Credit…Andrew Mangum for The New York Times Jesus Jiménez By Jesus Jiménez Feb. 28, 2022 Viatris, the drugmaker previously known as Mylan, announced on Monday that it had agreed to pay 264 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that alleged the company was involved in an illegal scheme to monopolize the market for epinephrine auto-injector devices known as EpiPens, which are used to treat severe allergic reactions. The proposed settlement, which needs to be approved by a judge, would resolve a legal battle that began after Mylan, in 2016, raised the price for a pack of two EpiPens to 608 from 100, the price since 2007, according to court documents. In the lawsuit, a group of plaintiffs made up of consumers, health insurance companies and other third-party payers alleged that by drastically raising the price of EpiPens, the drugmaker was “unlawfully exercising its monopoly power,” according to a complaint. “Were the price increases attributable to market conditions, increases in manufacturing costs or shortages in the supply of epinephrine?” the complaint said. “Absolutely not. They were driven solely by unaccountable executives and companies who sought to profit off of human misery and fear.” Many people involved in the lawsuit had paid thousands of dollars for EpiPens over the years, including a mother from Arizona who had paid 2,475 out of pocket for her son who is allergic to tree nuts and peanuts, and a father from Delaware who spent more than 1,100 on EpiPens for his son who is allergic to milk, eggs and peanuts, according to the lawsuit. EpiPens are made by two subsidiaries of Pfizer — King Pharmaceuticals and Meridian Medical Technologies — and are sold by Viatris. In July, Pfizer and its subsidiaries settled its part of the lawsuit for 345 million, and denied any wrongdoing. In its quarterly earnings report on Monday, Viatris said that the company “maintains that it acted lawfully and pro-competitively and the settlement contains no admission of liability.” “The board of directors believes that this settlement is in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders,” the report said. “The resolution of these indirect purchaser cases will allow the company to move forward and continue focusing on its strategic priorities and its mission of empowering people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life.” Editors’ Picks Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos Have Nothing and Everything in Common The Wild Beauty of Moss Is It OK to Send Condolence Notes to Strangers? Neither Viatris officials nor lawyers representing the company immediately responded to a request for comment on Monday night. Our business reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover. Lynn Sarko, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement that he urged consumers and third-party payers who paid for EpiPens to learn more about the settlement at a website where claims can be filed. “We are pleased that the EpiPen antitrust litigation is now concluded,” Paul Geller, another lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement, adding that the settlement is subject to court approval. The lawsuit also alleged that the drugmaker misclassified EpiPens under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to save hundreds of millions of dollars in rebates, and that it intervened in regulatory proceedings to delay competitors from entering the market. The price jump in 2016 drew widespread outrage, especially among parents of children with allergies. Thousands of people signed a petition urging Congress to intervene. After protests over the company’s raising the price of EpiPens in 2016, Mylan, as Viatris was then known, introduced a generic version of its own product. But it was announced with a wholesale list price of 300 for a pack of two, half the price of the brand-name EpiPen. In 2016, Mylan reached a 465 million settlement with the Justice Department and other government agencies over allegations that the drugmaker had overcharged Medicaid for the treatment by improperly classifying it as a generic drug. Third source: As the CEO of the drug maker that sells the EpiPen allergy-reaction injector defended the company’s six-fold price increases before Congress last week, it’s appalling to see that Heather Bresch took no fault. The company’s price hikes on a life-saving drug is clearly unethical if we take a closer look. EpiPen has gone from 100 for a two-pack in 2009 to 608 today. Usually, companies would be applauded for the ability to create revenue through such pricing power. But when it comes to life-saving drugs, consumers interpret these significant increases as the producer profiteering off a person’s life or death need. This is (not) unlike what happened at Turing Pharmaceuticals last year when the company increased the price of Daraprim from roughly 15 to 750. Like many, I had to ask: are these prices ethical? In the book, The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably, the authors present a five-step test to determine if a price is ethical. Here’s a look at how Mylan’s Epipens would perform under the test: Test #1: the exchange (transaction) is ethical when the price is paid voluntarily. The buyer is aware of how much the item costs and voluntarily completes the transaction. For this level, Mylan has passed at an elementary understanding. People are still buying EpiPens. Test #2: The buyer is provided ample information about the product. This expectation comes with any purchase. The seller is not misleading consumers or omitting crucial information. Smokers still purchase cigarettes, despite the full disclosure of health risks. For this level, Mylan still passes the test. Test #3 and #4 are not as simple, so let’s come back to them later in this article. Test #5: The exchange must present equal access to goods regardless of ability to cover the cost. Consumers have access to discounts based on financial need and Mylan also provides free EpiPens to schools and funds activities related to allergy awareness. They continue to pass the test for now. OK, now let’s get back to Test #3 and #4. Here is where consumer outrage and the case for unethical behavior becomes stronger. Test #3: This stipulates that sellers cannot exploit a buyer’s essential needs. Test #4: This states the price must be justified by costs. There should be no excessive, unjustified profits on essentials. For example, if a person was having a heart attack and needed emergency treatment, hospitals would first treat the patient before collecting a deposit upfront to ensure the patient can pay for their services. In 2011, the list price for the EpiPen was 165. At that time, there were no competitors in the market and the product was off patent, meaning the patent protection had expired. Further, there was consistent demand due to the product’s shelf life of one year. Customers had to replace their EpiPens annually. In 2012, the list price increased 32% with no new competitors entering the market. However, this increase could have resulted from more R&D spending or an increase in raw materials costs. Regardless, the price was elastic and consumers continued to purchase the drug. By 2013, Sanofi announced its entry into the market. Their price hovered near that of Mylan’s, so it would appear the price was justified by cost. Had Sanofi entered with a lower or higher price, this justification would have been tougher to sell. Mylan responded by increasing their price a little more, which likely came from a desire to differentiate themselves as the premier brand with superior products. At this point, Mylan was still within the ethical constraints put forth above. This changed when Sanofi, Mylan’s sole competitor, was forced into a product recall and left the market. Mylan once again had a monopoly. Typically, in this situation, the price would remain the same or increase nominally with inflation and other standard considerations. Instead, Mylan increased the price from 300 to 600 over two years. In 2015, Mylan reported a net profit margin of 8.9%, but some speculate the margin for the EpiPen was closer to 55%, thus breaking the ethical constraints of Test #3 and #4. While individual consumers may not have had a voice or recourse, the market did. Mylan may have improved its margins and ultimately driven higher returns and shareholder value, but within a week the price increase cost the company 3 billion in market cap and a stock tank of over 12% in 5 days. They attempted to rectify the issue and announced a generic brand of the EpiPen with a list price of 300. Because of this misstep, though, every price change now will come under extreme scrutiny. The ethics of pricing is a minefield for any company to navigate. Nominal price increases are annoyances to customers and consumers, but they—for the most part—will not be met with extreme criticism. As long as a company is transparent about price increases and can demonstrate that such a change is justified—or at least has the consumers’ faith that this is true—they should be able to avoid a public maelstrom. If the Mylan debacle demonstrates anything, it shows that even in markets that have little pricing regulation and transparency, pricing moves must be carefully considered and communicated in a way that demonstrates ethical behavior in the best interest of both the consumer and the company.

Make the IA again with IB business management ideals now that you have more information, Aim to do about 1600 - 19000 words the prompt is To what extent has the exorbitant price of Epi-pens been ethically and economically adequate?","output":"The International Baccalaureate (IB) Business Management Internal Assessment (IA) requires students to undertake an investigation into a real problem or issue faced by a business and to apply business management theories, tools, and techniques to address it. The IA should be structured systematically and coherently, utilizing both primary and secondary research to support arguments. **Title: To What Extent Has the Exorbitant Price of EpiPens Been Ethically and Economically Adequate?** **Word Count: 1600 - 1900** **Introduction** In this investigation, we will explore the EpiPen pricing strategy by Viatris (previously Mylan) to determine its ethical and economic justification. An EpiPen is a life-saving device used to treat anaphylaxis—a severe, potentially fatal allergic reaction. The focus of the analysis is on the price increase from approximately 100 for a two-pack in 2009 to 608 in 2016. The question is whether such a pricing strategy can be defended as ethically sound and economically justifiable. **Research Question** To what extent has the exorbitant price of EpiPens been ethically and economically adequate? **Methodology** The investigation relies on a variety of primary and secondary sources, including government records, legal documents, company reports, academic journals, and press releases. The analysis applies business management theories, including price skimming, monopoly power, and corporate social responsibility (CSR), and considers stakeholder theory to assess ethical considerations. A SWOT analysis will also be undertaken to evaluate the company's internal strengths and weaknesses and the external opportunities and threats regarding its pricing strategy. **Price Skimming Strategy** Applying a price skimming strategy involves launching a product at a high price, with the price being gradually reduced over time. According to this theory, a high price can be justified for innovative products or when facing limited competition. This section will address whether the cost of research and development, patent protection, and lack of competition have allowed Viatris to adopt a price skimming strategy with EpiPens. **Monopoly Pricing and Market Dynamics** This section will look into economic justifications for the pricing of EpiPens. Considering the monopoly Viatris secured in the absence of competition from Sanofi, this section will analyze how monopoly power has been leveraged in pricing decisions. The economic impacts on demand, consumer surplus, and welfare will be examined. **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Ethical Considerations** CSR suggests that companies have an obligation to operate in an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner. This section will assess whether Viatris’s pricing strategy meets CSR norms and ethical business practices. It will draw on stakeholder theory to weigh the obligations of Viatris to its shareholders against the interests of consumers and the broader society. **Pricing Transparency and Consumer Trust** Drawing on business ethics, this section investigates the transparency of Viatris’s pricing strategy. It will delve into whether consumers have been adequately informed about the cost and the basis for the price increases over time. This segment will also address the trust between Viatris and its consumers, examining whether consumer confidence has been undermined by the pricing controversy surrounding EpiPens. **Regulatory Influence and Legal Considerations** This section reviews the regulatory environment in which Viatris operates. It will discuss any legal challenges and settlements the company has faced due to its pricing strategies, such as the 2016 lawsuit settlement and the subsequent price reduction for EpiPens. **SWOT Analysis** A SWOT analysis will highlight the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with Viatris's EpiPen pricing strategy. This comprehensive analysis will allow a conclusion to be drawn regarding the sustainability and justification of the EpiPen’s pricing structure. **Stakeholder Impact Assessment** An evaluation will be made of the impacts of pricing decisions on various stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, insurance companies, shareholders, and regulators. This will encompass both the repercussions of high prices on access to EpiPens and the implications for Viatris's financial performance and reputation. **Conclusion** The report will culminate in a balanced discussion on whether the pricing of EpiPens by Viatris has been ethically and economically adequate, considering the company's profits against consumer access to a life-saving medication. Recommendations will be made for pricing strategies that align with ethical and economic principles, with the aim of reconciling profitability with social responsibility. **References and Appendices** A comprehensive list of all the sources cited in the report will be included. Appendices may feature diagrams, figures, or tables that support the analysis. **Executive Summary** This summary will encapsulate the key findings and recommendations of the investigation, providing a concise overview of whether the EpiPen's pricing reflects ethical and economical adequacy."},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hello!

It appears to be a character's dialogue, likely belonging to a character with a masculine or possibly a rough tone, given the choice of expressions. Here's a breakdown of the components: 1. パパス - This is a proper noun, likely the name of a character speaking. In English, this would be \\"Papas.\\" 2. おう (ō) - This is an informal way to say \\"oh\\" or \\"hey,\\" often used to grab someone's attention or show acknowledgment. 3. おあこそ - \\"おあこそ\\" is an archaic or dialectal expression that doesn't have a direct equivalent in modern standard Japanese. Its tone suggests an informal greeting or an expression of \\"well then,\\" \\"alright,\\" or \\"at last.\\" It often adds a certain flavor to the speech, making it sound old-fashioned or from a particular region or class. 4. 目がさめた (me ga sameta) - This means \\"woke up\\" or \\"eyes have opened.\\" \\"目\\" (me) means \\"eye,\\" and \\"さめた\\" (sameta) is the past tense of \\"さめる\\" (sameru), which means \\"to wake up\\" or \\"to become alert.\\" 5. ようだ (yōda) - This is a common grammatical construction that indicates something appears to be a certain way or seems like something. It can often be translated as \\"it seems that\\" or \\"it looks like.\\" 6. な (na) - This is a sentence-ending particle that adds an emotive or confirmatory nuance, equivalent to \\"right,\\" \\"isn't it,\\" or a tag question like \\"eh?\\" in English. It softens the statement and makes it less blunt, often indicating that the speaker is looking for agreement or acknowledgment from the listener. Put together, a loose translation of \\"おう おあこそ! 目がさめたようだな。\\" could be \\"Oh, finally! It seems you've woken up, eh?\\" or \\"Hey there! You've woken up, it seems, eh?\\" The use of particles and the choice of words helps to convey a casual, masculine tone, typical of an older, authoritative figure or someone familiar speaking to a younger person or subordinate."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically パパス「なに? 夢を見た? 赤ん坊のときの夢で どこかの お城みたいだったと?","output":"The given text is a piece of dialogue, presumably spoken by a character named \\"Papas\\" in Japanese. I'll break down the grammatical components of the sentence: 1. パパス (Papas) - This is a proper noun, likely the name of a character who is speaking. 2. 「なに? (nani?) - \\"なに\\" translates to \\"what\\" in English. The question mark indicates that it is being used as a question, meaning \\"What?\\" 3. 夢を見た? (yume o mita?) - \\"夢\\" (yume) means \\"dream,\\" \\"を\\" (o) is an object particle marking \\"夢\\" (dream) as the object of the verb, and \\"見た\\" (mita) is the past tense of \\"見る\\" (miru), which means \\"to see\\" or \\"to look at.\\" The past tense \\"mita\\" indicates that the seeing has already occurred. Together, \\"夢を見た?\\" means \\"Did you have a dream?\\" 4. 赤ん坊のときの (akanbō no toki no) - \\"赤ん坊\\" (akanbō) means \\"baby,\\" \\"のとき\\" (no toki) means \\"time of\\" or \\"when,\\" and \\"の\\" (no) is a possessive particle. Combined, \\"赤ん坊のときの\\" refers to \\"the time when (you were) a baby.\\" 5. 夢で (yume de) - \\"夢\\" (yume) again means \\"dream,\\" and here \\"で\\" (de) is a particle used to indicate context or means. It can be understood as \\"in the dream\\" or \\"through the dream.\\" 6. どこかの (dokoka no) - \\"どこか\\" (dokoka) translates to \\"somewhere,\\" and \\"の\\" (no) is a possessive particle. \\"どこかの\\" is a way of saying \\"some\\" or \\"a certain,\\" as in \\"a certain place\\" or \\"somewhere.\\" 7. お城 (o-shiro) - \\"お城\\" (oshiro) means \\"castle.\\" The prefix \\"お\\" (o) is an honorific that is often added to nouns in Japanese to express respect or politeness. 8. みたいだったと? (mitai datta to?) - \\"みたい\\" (mitai) is a suffix that means \\"like\\" or \\"similar to.\\" \\"だった\\" (datta) is the past tense of \\"だ\\" (da), which is the plain form of \\"です\\" (desu), meaning \\"to be.\\" \\"と\\" (to) is a quoting particle that indicates the preceding phrase is what someone said or thought. The entire phrase \\"みたいだったと?\\" translates to \\"was it like?\\" or \\"it seemed like?\\" and the question mark suggests that the speaker is asking if it appeared a certain way. So piecing the dialogue together, the character Papas is saying: \\"What? Did you have a dream? Was it a dream about when you were a baby, something like a certain castle?\\" This sentence suggests that Papas is inquiring about someone else's dream, specifically a dream related to their infancy and involving a castle."},{"instruction":"Como é que se podem ver na ListBox os registros ordenados por ordem crescente de distâncias? ef on_command_select_for_augmentation(event, conn): # Mostrar mensagem de que o processo está sendo executado #messagebox.showinfo(\\"Processamento\\", \\"Processando dados de Augmentation…\\") # Obtém o índice do item selecionado index = db_commands_listbox.curselection() if not index: messagebox.showwarning(\\"Erro\\", \\"Nenhum comando selecionado.\\") return # Obtém o dado do comando selecionado (suponha que a listbox foi carregada corretamente com os dados) cmd_id, file_path, transcription, _mfcc_blob = list_commands(conn)[index[0]] # Chama a função de augmentação de áudio e obtém os caminhos dos novos arquivos de áudio augmented_file_paths = augment_audio(file_path, transcription, conn) # Opcional: Atualizar a listbox para exibir os novos arquivos de áudio adicionados, ou qualquer outra ação necessária # Limpa o painel esquerdo (se já tiver algo antes) for widget in left_panel.winfo_children(): widget.destroy() # Vamos agora criar uma nova listbox no painel esquerdo para mostrar informações distance_listbox = tk.Listbox(left_panel) distance_listbox.pack(fill='both', expand=True) # Carrega os MFCC originais do BLOB original_mfcc = pickle.loads(_mfcc_blob) # Para cada augmentação, calcule a distância DTW em relação ao áudio original for augmented_path, augmented_transcription in augmented_file_paths: # Carregue os MFCCs para o arquivo de áudio augmentado augmented_mfcc = calculate_mfcc(augmented_path) # Calcule a distância usando fastdtw distance, path = fastdtw(original_mfcc, augmented_mfcc, dist=euclidean) # Atualize a listbox com a distância distance_listbox.insert(tk.END, f\\"{augmented_transcription}: Distância {distance:.2f}\\") # Recarrega a lista de comandos no painel direito para incluir as novas augmentations load_commands_to_listbox(db_commands_listbox)","output":"Para que você possa ver os registros ordenados por ordem crescente de distâncias na ListBox de uma interface Tkinter em Python, você precisa coletar os dados (incluindo as distâncias) em uma estrutura de dados que possa ser ordenada facilmente antes de inseri-los na ListBox.

Aqui está um exemplo de como você pode definir cores de texto e de fundo diferentes para cada item na \`ListBox\`: \`\`\`python import tkinter as tk # Função auxiliar para adicionar um item com cor específica def add_colored_item(listbox, text, text_color, bg_color): listbox.insert(tk.END, text) # Define uma tag para os últimos itens adicionados listbox.itemconfig(tk.END, {'fg': text_color, 'bg': bg_color}) # Cria a janela principal root = tk.Tk() listbox = tk.Listbox(root) listbox.pack() # Adiciona itens com cores diferentes add_colored_item(listbox, 'Item 1', 'red', 'yellow') # Texto vermelho em fundo amarelo add_colored_item(listbox, 'Item 2', 'green', 'lightgray') # Texto verde em fundo cinza claro add_colored_item(listbox, 'Item 3', 'blue', 'white') # Texto azul em fundo branco # Inicia o loop principal root.mainloop() \`\`\` Neste exemplo, a função \`add_colored_item\` é chamada para adicionar um item à \`ListBox\` e então alterar imediatamente a cor do texto e de fundo desse item usando \`itemconfig\`. \`tk.END\` é usado para aplicar a tag ao item que acabou de ser adicionado à \`ListBox\`. Vale ressaltar que cores de fundo de itens individuais em uma \`ListBox\` podem não ser suportadas em todos os sistemas operacionais ou podem ter aparências inconsistentes. Em sistemas como macOS, por exemplo, a cor de fundo dos itens em uma \`ListBox\` pode não ser visível ou pode não se comportar como esperado. A cor de texto (foreground) é normalmente menos problemática.

Here are a few examples: 1. Hierarchical structure: Ancient Egypt had a clear hierarchical structure, with the pharaoh as the highest authority, followed by priests, nobles, scribes, and commoners. This hierarchical structure can still be observed in modern societies, where individuals have different social positions and levels of authority, such as presidents, politicians, professionals, and workers. 2. Religious beliefs: Ancient Egyptian society revolved around a complex system of religious beliefs and rituals focused on the worship of numerous gods and goddesses. This belief in a higher power and the importance of religious practices has endured in modern life, as many people continue to have faith in various religions and engage in religious rituals and traditions. 3. Importance of education: Education had great significance in ancient Egypt, and being literate was highly valued. Scribes, who were essential for administrative and record-keeping tasks, enjoyed high social status. This emphasis on education and knowledge continues to be relevant in modern society, where education is considered essential for personal development, professional success, and social recognition. 4. Social classes and inequality: Ancient Egyptian society was divided into social classes, with the pharaoh and the elites enjoying privileges and wealth, while the majority of people were commoners who lived more modest lives. This division between higher and lower social classes can still be observed in modern society, where income inequality and social divisions persist, albeit in different forms. 5. Family structure: The ancient Egyptians placed great importance on family and kinship ties. The nuclear family was the basic unit of society, and extended families often lived together. In modern life, family values and the significance of familial bonds continue to play a vital role in various cultures around the world. While these aspects of ancient Egyptian social structure have endured in modern life, it is essential to recognize that societies have evolved significantly since ancient times, and cultural, economic, and technological changes have also influenced social structures and norms."},{"instruction":"continue this to 750 words in total and keep it at a low reading level: One day while we were driving and right after we exited the highway we started to hear loud noises that sounded like fireworks. But they were not fireworks, they were people shooting at the car in front of us but our van was right in the middle. Then all of a sudden we heard glass shatter and our van was hit and then we got down as fast as we could. There was suddenly a pause of bullets being shot so my dad quickly drove to a safe area nearby while the gunshots passed. It was a small neighborhood. The street was like a half circle where we were relieved going around after we came out. We saw that there was another car that must have been next to us during the shooting that was parked there with the police so my dad talked to the police about what the shooter's car looked like. But thankfully everyone was fine. The people in the other car said their car was luckily not hit, but now I realized they were just using us for cover. After that we took the highway and noticed one of the exits coming up had a car wash. So when the exit came we took it and noticed nobody was there. It looked closed but it was open so we cleaned out all of the broken glass and put it in the trash. After that we saw life differently. We realized how important it is to control your emotions and be aware of your surroundings so everyone is safe. People should always be in control of their emotions because if we got out of control and didn't focus, someone could have gotten shot or we could have crashed. Self awareness is important because it helps us become better decision makers. It is important because it helps you understand the situation you are in. And it is also important because it helps you manage your emotions better.","output":"When we got back on the road, we were all shaken up. My mom kept checking on me and my siblings to make sure we were okay. I could tell she was scared, but she tried to stay calm for us. As we continued driving, my dad talked to us about the importance of being aware of our surroundings. He explained that if we hadn't noticed the car wash at the upcoming exit, we might have driven around with broken glass, which could have been dangerous. It made me realize how easily we can miss important things if we're not paying attention. He also emphasized the need to control our emotions, especially in dangerous situations. He told us that panicking or becoming angry could cloud our judgment and make the situation worse. Instead, he said it's important to stay calm and think clearly in order to keep ourselves and others safe. After that incident, our family started practicing self-awareness more consciously. We made an effort to be more present in the moment and pay attention to what was happening around us. We didn't want to take our safety for granted anymore. My parents taught us some simple techniques to help us stay aware and in control of our emotions. They encouraged us to take deep breaths and count to ten when we felt upset or overwhelmed. They also taught us to look around and notice our surroundings, noticing small details that we might have overlooked before. We applied these techniques in various situations, not just while driving. Whether we were at school, at the park, or even at home, we made a conscious effort to be aware of our surroundings and manage our emotions. Over time, being self-aware became a natural part of our lives. It helped us become better decision-makers, as we were able to consider all the information available to us before making choices. It also made us more empathetic towards others, as we discovered that everyone has their own battles and emotions to navigate. I am grateful for that scary incident because it taught me valuable lessons about self-awareness and controlling my emotions. It made me realize that life can be unpredictable and dangerous, but if we are mindful and present, we can better protect ourselves and those around us. Now, whenever I hear loud noises or sense danger, I take a deep breath and remind myself to stay calm and aware. I understand that my emotions play a significant role in how I react to situations and that staying in control can make a big difference. By sharing our story, I hope to inspire others to practice self-awareness and emotional control. Even though my family went through a frightening experience, we emerged stronger and wiser. And it's my wish that others can learn from our experience and apply these lessons in their own lives."},{"instruction":"lower reading level","output":"Once, while we were driving, we heard really loud noises that sounded like fireworks.

My dad talked to the police about what the shooter's car looked like. Thankfully, everyone was okay. Later, we noticed a car wash coming up as we got back on the highway. We decided to take that exit and found that it looked closed, but it was actually open. We used the car wash to clean up all the broken glass and threw it away. This experience changed the way we saw life. We realized how important it is to stay in control of our emotions and be aware of our surroundings to keep everyone safe. It's crucial to manage our emotions and stay focused because if we lost control and didn't pay attention, someone could have been hurt or we could have gotten into an accident. Being self-aware is essential because it helps us make better decisions. It's important because it helps us understand the situation we're in. And it's also important because it helps us manage our emotions better. After that day, my family took extra care to be more aware of our surroundings. We made sure to pay attention and not take our safety for granted anymore. My parents taught us simple techniques to help us stay aware and in control of our emotions. They told us to take deep breaths and count to ten when we felt upset or overwhelmed. They also encouraged us to look around and notice the small details that we might have missed before. We started using these techniques in many different situations, not just when we were driving. Whether we were at school, the park, or even at home, we made a real effort to be aware of what was happening around us and manage our emotions. Practicing self-awareness became a normal part of our lives. It helped us become better at making decisions because we could think about everything going on around us before making choices. It also made us more understanding towards other people's feelings, as we learned that everyone has their own struggles and emotions they're dealing with. I'm thankful for that scary incident because it taught me important lessons about self-awareness and controlling my emotions. It made me realize that life can be uncertain and dangerous, but if we stay mindful and present, we can protect ourselves and others better. Now, when I hear loud noises or sense danger, I remember to take a deep breath and stay calm. I know that my emotions influence how I react to situations and that being in control can make a big difference. By sharing our story, I hope to inspire others to practice self-awareness and emotional control. Even though my family went through a terrifying experience, we became stronger and wiser. I hope others can learn from what happened to us and apply these lessons to their own lives."},{"instruction":"change the last 15 sentences","output":"After that scary incident, things changed for our family.

It's primarily used for retopology, creating decals, or ensuring that one object snugly fits the contour of another. However, shrinkwrapping is not generally suited for full character shapeshifting, especially when dealing with complex SFM (Source Filmmaker) models, which may have different topologies, rigging systems, and textures. To shapeshift or transfer the shape of one SFM character model to another, you would typically need to go through a more involved process that could include: 1. **Retopology**: If the models have significantly different topologies, you may need to retopologize one to match the other's mesh flow to ensure that deformation and rigging will work correctly after the adjustment. 2. **Rigging**: The armature (skeleton) of each SFM model should be compatible. If they're not, you might need to adjust or create a new rig that fits the target mesh but maintains the original rig's joint locations and animation capabilities. 3. **Weight Painting**: Transferring weights from one model to another can be a challenge if the topologies are different. You need to ensure that vertex groups and their corresponding weights are correctly assigned so that the mesh deforms naturally with the armature. 4. **Transferring Textures**: You may need to adjust UV maps or create new textures to fit the modified geometry or to maintain the visual fidelity of the transferred model. 5. **Shape Keys/Blend Shapes**: If the deformation you want involves morphing facial expressions or other detailed features, you might use shape keys to interpolate between the different forms if they are compatible between models. While Blender doesn't have a built-in feature that allows easy shapeshifting between two completely different character models, there are advanced techniques such as using a multi-resolution modifier or mesh data transfer, which may help in some aspects of interpolating shapes between models, but this is generally a complex process that might require scripting or manual tweaking to achieve the desired results. The processes outlined above can be technically demanding. Depending on the specific nature of the SFM models you want to shapeshift, you might need a good understanding of mesh editing, armature rigging, and skinning in Blender. This task also requires patience and a fair bit of trial and error to achieve satisfactory results. If you're working with proprietary SFM models or transferring to and from different formats, ensure that you're respecting the creator's rights and copyright considerations."},{"instruction":"open ai도 그것을 본보기삼아 더욱 분발하세요를 영어로 번역","output":"Translation: \\"OpenAI, take that as an example and strive even harder.\\""},{"instruction":"open ai도 그것을 본보기삼아 더욱 분발하십시오를 번역","output":"Let OpenAI also take that as an example and redouble its efforts."},{"instruction":"오픈 AI와 구글의 딥마인드는 AI 분야의 선두입니다","output":"\\"OpenAI and Google's DeepMind are at the forefront of the AI field.\\""},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

By calculating the volume of unit cells, the unit cell parameters of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 are as follows: a = b = 9.040 Å, c = 10.722 Å (Rp = 5.86%, Rwp = 9.29%). The corresponding cell volume is 876.219 Å3 (Fig. 5c). Upon charging to 4.3 V, a and b decrease to 8.788 Å, while c increases to 10.971 Å (Rp = 5.94%, Rwp = 9.42%). Consequently, the corresponding cell volume reduces to 847.279 Å3 (Fig. 5d). The observed volume change is as low as 3.3%, indicating the extremely low lattice strain of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 during the extraction process of Na+ ions. Upon discharging to 2.5 V, both a and b increase to 8.991 Å, while c decreases to 10.680 Å (Rp = 5.09%, Rwp = 8.83%). As a result, the cell volume returns to 863.351 Å3 (Fig. 5e). The detected volume change is merely 1.5% compared to the initial state. This suggests that NVPF@rGO, as prepared in this study, demonstrates an ultra-stable cycling feature due to the high reversibility and low strain of the crystal lattice."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) are expensive and worldwide availability is limited. Epinephrine prefilled syringes and epinephrine kits are potentially lower-cost alternatives to EAIs. Advantages, disadvantages, and costs of available products are discussed. The socioeconomic factors impacting access to EAIs are described. Keywords: epinephrine, anaphylaxis, cost, price, autoinjector Go to: Introduction Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for systemic allergic reactions (SARs) to foods, insect stings or bites, medications, and other allergens. The early use of epinephrine in SARs can be life-saving; delayed use has been associated with death.1–3 Cox et al updated the World Allergy Organization (WAO) grading system for SARs as summarized in Table 1 to clarify the early signs and symptoms of an SAR and to encourage early use of epinephrine.4 The term “SAR” applies to all grades with the term “anaphylaxis” also appropriate for grade 4 or 5 reactions. Table 1 Proposed modification of the 2010 World Allergy Organization grading system Grading system for SARs Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 Grade 5 Anaphylaxis Symptom(s)/sign(s) from 1 organ system present Cutaneous • Urticaria and/or erythema-warmth and/or pruritus, other than localized at the injection site And/or • Tingling, or itching of the lips* or • Angioedema (not laryngeal) Or Upper respiratory • Nasal symptoms (eg, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, and/or nasal congestion) And/or • Throat-clearing (itchy throat) And/or • Cough not related to bronchospasm Or Conjunctival • Erythema, pruritus, or tearing Or Other • Nausea • Metallic taste Symptom(s)/sign(s) from ≥2 organ symptoms listed in grade 1 Lower airway • Mild bronchospasm, eg, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath which responds to treatment And/or Gastrointestinal • Abdominal cramps* and/or vomiting/diarrhea Other • Uterine cramps • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grade 1 would be included Lower airway • Severe bronchospasm, eg, not responding or worsening in spite of treatment And/or Upper airway • Laryngeal edema with stridor • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grades 1 or 3 would be included Lower or upper airway • Respiratory failure And/or Cardiovascular • Collapse/hypotension^ And/or Loss of consciousness (vasovagal excluded) • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grades 1, 3, or 4 would be included Open in a separate window Notes: The final grade of the reaction is not determined until the event is over, regardless of the medication administered to treat the reaction. The final report should include the first symptom(s)/sign(s) and the time of onset after the causative agent exposure and a suffix reflecting if and when epinephrine was or was not administered: a, ≤5 min; b, >5 min to ≤10 min; c, >10 to ≤20 min; d, >20 min; z, epinephrine not administered. Final report: Grade 1-5; a-d, or z; First symptom(s)/sign(s); Time of onset of first symptom(s)/signs(s). Case example. Within 10 min of receiving an AIT injection, a patient develops generalized urticaria followed by a tickling sensation in the posterior pharynx. Intramuscular epinephrine is administered within 5 min of symptoms(s)/sign(s) resulting in complete resolution of the reaction. The final report would be: Grade 2; a; Urticaria; 10 min. *Application-site reactions would be considered local reactions. Oral mucosa symptoms, such as pruritus, after SLIT administration, or warmth and/or pruritus at a subcutaneous immunotherapy injection site would be considered a local reaction. However, tingling or itching of the lips or mouth could be interpreted as a SAR if the known allergen, eg, peanut, is inadvertently placed into the mouth or ingested in a subject with a history of a peanut-induced SAR. Gastrointestinal tract reactions after SLIT or OIT would also be considered local reactions, unless they occur with other systemic manifestations. SLIT or OIT reactions associated with gastrointestinal tract and other systemic manifestations would be classified as SARs. SLIT local reactions would be classified according to the WAO grading system for SLIT local reactions.33 A fatal reaction would not be classified in this grading system but rather reported as a serious adverse event. ^Hypotension is defined per the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Expert Panel criteria34: “Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours). A) Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic blood pressure. Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as follows: 1 mo to 1 y: <70 mm Hg, 1–10 y: <70 mm Hg + [2 × age], 11–17 y: <90 mm Hg. B) Adults: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline.

Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) were developed in the 1970s and were first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1987 with the EpiPen® (Mylan, Canonsburg, PA, USA). EAIs available in the USA include: EpiPen; epinephrine injection, United States Pharmacopeia autoinjector, generic (Mylan); epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector (Impax Generics, Hayward, CA, USA); and Auvi-Q® (Kaléo, Richmond, VA, USA). The annual direct costs in year 2010 in the USA for EAIs are estimated to be 294 million, accounting for about 25% of the 1.2 billion annual cost to treat SARs including anaphylaxis.5,6 The average wholesale price (AWP) of each EAI is included in Table 2, except for the Auvi-Q. Accurate wholesale pricing for the Auvi-Q is not available as it is distributed through a single specialty pharmacy network. The complexity of drug pricing is beyond the scope of this article. Costs for the EpiPen were relatively stable until Mylan acquired this product from Merck (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) in 2007. The AWP since that time for two EpiPens has increased 545% from 113.27 to 730.33.4 This price increase persists even after accounting for inflation (Figure 1).7,8 Although the out-of-pocket expenses for individual subjects may have decreased since the public outcry about EpiPen costs in 2016, the effective date of the most recent AWP available is May 16, 2016 and does not reflect the impact of price cuts or patient assistance programs.7 An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is jaa-11-153Fig1.jpg Figure 1 AWP for the EpiPen® 2001–2016.

Abbreviations: AWP, average wholesale price; ea, each; NDC: national drug code. Use of the AWP is controversial, but it is often used as a proxy for societal cost in cost-effectiveness analyses.9 An economic analysis published in 2011 utilized the 2006–2007 AWP of the EpiPen to estimate the annual cost of EAIs for food-induced SARs.10 According to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research good research practices guidelines from 2010: Pharmaceutical prices used in the vast majority of cost-effectiveness analyses are either based on AWPs in the USA or government-negotiated prices in Europe. The former are not only imperfect measures of actual prices paid (e.g., ignoring discounts and rebates), but may also greatly overestimate societal opportunity costs because of the implicit inclusion of producer surplus created through patent-protected monopoly pricing.11 In summary, AWP is used as an approximation for societal drug costs, despite its limitations. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) discusses the challenge of determining medication costs for research purposes. The HERC states, “We recommend using 121% of the drug costs reported in the Federal Supply Schedule, 152% of the VA cost, or 64% of AWP. To find the cost of a generic label prescription drug, we recommend using 27% of AWP.”9 Federal Supply Schedule prices are publicly available.12 Several factors limit the ability of newer products to garner and maintain a better market share versus Mylan’s EpiPen. First, the EpiPen has name recognition. Second, training for the use of each device is different. To illustrate, the epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector from Impax Generics requires the removal of two caps rather than just one. Although learning to use a new device can be challenging, novel design elements can improve safety and usability. An example is that the Auvi-Q has unique features including its rectangular shape intended to fit into a pocket, a retractable needle, and voice instructions. Third, insurance coverage differs for each EAI. According to the Managed Markets Insight and Technology database, the EpiPen has unrestricted access for 61% of commercial lives among 4624 commercial health plans.13 In contrast, Auvi-Q has unrestricted access for “19% of commercial lives in all locations” among these same commercial health plans.8 Even though Auvi-Q is not covered by many commercial insurance plans, the manufacturer offers it with 0 copayment to all commercially insured and Medicaid patients through a specialty pharmacy network distributor. Fourth, EAIs are rated “BX” by the FDA indicating that “data that have been reviewed by the Agency are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence” and when ordered may not be substituted by a pharmacist, one for another.14 The impact of copayments, coupons, and patient assistance programs on prices that subjects pay at the pharmacy counter requires further research. Pourang et al found that copayments did not affect the likelihood of an EAI being dispensed once it was prescribed in the Kaiser Permanente Health Maintenance Organization.15 However, while the authors indicate that nearly 30% of copayments exceeded 30, they did not consider higher copayments. Data are not available on prescription:dispense ratios for subjects with exceedingly high copayments or for uninsured and underinsured subjects who may pay retail prices. More than 50% of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned or not filled when the cost exceeds 300 for a 2-pack.5 Two generic EAIs manufactured by Mylan have an AWP of 375. Two generic EAIs manufactured by Impax Generics have an AWP of 494.01. Patients with any commercial insurance plan or Medicaid receive Auvi-Q for 0 copayment through the specialty pharmacy network, ASPN Pharmacies LLC (200 Park Avenue, Suite 300, Florham Park, NJ 07932, 973-295-3289). All uninsured subjects who make <100,000 annually have no copayment for Auvi-Q; uninsured subjects whose incomes exceed 100,000 pay no more than 360 for Auvi-Q. Socioeconomic factors impact access to EAIs. Children from high-income versus low-income homes are 8.35 times more likely to be prescribed EAIs.16 Medicaid-enrolled children are less likely to receive EAIs prior to arrival at an emergency department.17 In another study, Caucasian versus non-Caucasian children were more likely to receive epinephrine early during an SAR.18 Early use of epinephrine was defined as epinephrine administered before arrival to the emergency department. Owning an EAI greatly increased the odds of early epinephrine treatment (odds ratio 12.67, 95% CI: 4.46–35.96). The authors did not assess insurance status but indicate that this finding suggests that there might be an economic influence on access to EAIs.18 Fleming et al examined the out-of-pocket costs for medications associated with food allergy and found higher costs for Caucasian and higher-income subjects.18 They hypothesize that Medicaid-enrolled children may have lower out-of-pocket costs, that is, lower copayments. To reduce or eliminate insurance copayments, Fromer suggests that epinephrine be classified as a preventive medicine by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).5 Decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro, Williamstown, MA, USA) has been used to evaluate the cost of generic EAIs versus the EpiPen using a model that tracked spending for individual subjects over 20 years, with the assumption that each subject needs two 2-packs yearly, one each for home and school or work.19 The cost for the EpiPen over a 20-year model duration totals 58,667 (95% CI: 57,745–59,588) versus 45,588 for the generic EAI (95% CI: 44,873–46,304). The model also incorporates other food allergy-related costs, such as specialist visits, grocery costs, and loss of work time for parents of food-allergic children. These costs are assumed to be the same for all subjects regardless of the type of EAI prescribed. The price of EAIs also affects school districts and communities. The Michigan legislature mandated that all public schools stock EAIs. It estimated the cost for two EAI 2-packs, one adult and one pediatric, at 140, while the “recently reported costs for commercial sources” was 1200, according to the authors of the article. The annual calculated cost to Michigan public schools based on these two cost estimates ranges from 565,460 to 4,846,800.20 A 2007 WAO survey of its House of Delegates indicates that EAIs are available in 59% of 44 countries surveyed.21 Those without EAIs employed other methods for the self-administration of epinephrine.22 These include the use of ampules of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) with an empty 1 cc syringe to be drawn up as needed or prefilled syringes containing various amounts of epinephrine. Both options are much less expensive than EAIs; for example, a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) had an AWP of 2.52 and retail price of ~12 in 2016.7 Epinephrine ampules may not be available in all countries. Both options also allow for tailored dosing of epinephrine, above or below the standard 0.15 or 0.3 mg doses contained in most FDA-approved EAIs. This may be beneficial for children weighing <15 kg (33 pounds) or for large or obese subjects. Of note, in November 2017, the FDA approved an infant version of the Auvi-Q, Auvi-q 0.1mg, for children weighing 7.5–15 kg (16.5–33 pounds). It has a shorter needle and a smaller dose of epinephrine (0.1 mg versus 0.15 mg contained in other “junior” products). Market forces appear to influence the cost of EAIs. For example, some US companies are offering low-cost alternatives. Symjepi™ (Adamis, San Diego, CA, USA) is an epinephrine prefilled syringe (EPS) that contains 0.3 mg of epinephrine, with a user-friendly design. It was approved by the FDA in June 2017 for subjects 30 kg (66 pounds) or more and is expected to be available at a lower cost than the current EAIs. A “junior” version is expected to follow. The concept of prefilled syringes is not new. The Ana-Kit® (Hollister-Stier Laboratories, Spokane, WA, USA) consisted of a syringe filled with 1 mL of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) housed in a protective case for subcutaneous injection before it was removed from the US market.23,24 The Ana-Kit syringe had 0.1 mL graduations so that smaller doses could be administered depending on the subject’s age. The instructions recommended the following doses: “Adults and children over 12 years: 0.3 mL; 6–12 years: 0.2 mL; 2–6 years: 0.15 mL; infants to 2 years: 0.05–0.1 mL.”25 An appropriate dose could be administered by pushing the syringe plunger until it stopped. A second dose could be administered as appropriate, after rotating the rectangular plunger ¼ turn to the right, to line up with a rectangular slot in the syringe.25 An advantage of the prefilled Symjepi syringe is that it is housed in a dark blue plastic encasement to protect the epinephrine from ultraviolet light degradation. Epinephrine degrades with exposure to ultraviolet light, oxygen in ambient air, and excessive heat.26–28 EPSs stored at room temperature in a pencil box maintain acceptable US Pharmacopeia concentrations (90%–115% of label claim), pH, and sterility for 3 months.22 The stability is limited to 2 months in high-temperature and low-humidity climates.22,29 In addition, some physicians and other health care professionals provide subjects with prefilled syringes wrapped in aluminum foil.28,30 These can be transported in a crush-resistant eyeglass case. Snap Medical Industries (Dubin, OH, USA) has developed EpinephrineSnap-V® (a kit containing a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes) and the EpinephrineSnap convenience kit (a kit containing an ampule of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes). The Focus Health Group, located in Knoxville, TN, USA, has been contracted to commercialize these products. The AWP of this product is 1567 although information from company officials states that the average price of EpinephrineSnap is 80 and the EpinephrineSnap-V is 130, with discounted group purchasing organization pricing available (Personal communication, November 1, 2017). Use of these options may not be as practical as is an EAI. The reason is that an epinephrine ampule or vial with an empty syringe requires more skill to properly draw up the epinephrine and administer it under emergency circumstances. Parents of individuals with a history of an SAR take longer to draw up epinephrine from an ampule (average 142±13 seconds) compared to emergency department nurses (29±0.09 seconds; p<0.05).31 The epinephrine dose drawn up by parents also ranged 40-fold as compared to twofold for emergency department nurses.31 The EpinephrineSnap products are geared toward use by emergency medical technicians and other health care professionals rather than individual subjects. The rising cost of EAIs has made self-administered epinephrine potentially unavailable to some subjects. There are no data on deaths attributed to inability to afford EAIs. Lower-cost alternatives such as EPSs and epinephrine kits are entering the US market. EAIs have advantages, such as ease of use, but they are expensive. More research is needed on the complexity of drug pricing and on the optimal methods to determine individual and societal costs. Classifying EAIs as USPSTF preventive medicines could improve access by reducing or eliminating copayments. Second source: Viatris Agrees to Settle EpiPen Antitrust Litigation for 264 Million The proposed settlement, which requires a judge’s approval, would resolve a legal battle that began after the company, in 2016, raised the price for two EpiPens to 608 from 100. Share full article In 2016, Viatris, then known as Mylan, raised the price for two EpiPens to 608 from 100, according to court documents.Credit…Andrew Mangum for The New York Times Jesus Jiménez By Jesus Jiménez Feb. 28, 2022 Viatris, the drugmaker previously known as Mylan, announced on Monday that it had agreed to pay 264 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that alleged the company was involved in an illegal scheme to monopolize the market for epinephrine auto-injector devices known as EpiPens, which are used to treat severe allergic reactions. The proposed settlement, which needs to be approved by a judge, would resolve a legal battle that began after Mylan, in 2016, raised the price for a pack of two EpiPens to 608 from 100, the price since 2007, according to court documents. In the lawsuit, a group of plaintiffs made up of consumers, health insurance companies and other third-party payers alleged that by drastically raising the price of EpiPens, the drugmaker was “unlawfully exercising its monopoly power,” according to a complaint. “Were the price increases attributable to market conditions, increases in manufacturing costs or shortages in the supply of epinephrine?” the complaint said. “Absolutely not. They were driven solely by unaccountable executives and companies who sought to profit off of human misery and fear.” Many people involved in the lawsuit had paid thousands of dollars for EpiPens over the years, including a mother from Arizona who had paid 2,475 out of pocket for her son who is allergic to tree nuts and peanuts, and a father from Delaware who spent more than 1,100 on EpiPens for his son who is allergic to milk, eggs and peanuts, according to the lawsuit. EpiPens are made by two subsidiaries of Pfizer — King Pharmaceuticals and Meridian Medical Technologies — and are sold by Viatris. In July, Pfizer and its subsidiaries settled its part of the lawsuit for 345 million, and denied any wrongdoing. In its quarterly earnings report on Monday, Viatris said that the company “maintains that it acted lawfully and pro-competitively and the settlement contains no admission of liability.” “The board of directors believes that this settlement is in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders,” the report said. “The resolution of these indirect purchaser cases will allow the company to move forward and continue focusing on its strategic priorities and its mission of empowering people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life.” Editors’ Picks Emma Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos Have Nothing and Everything in Common The Wild Beauty of Moss Is It OK to Send Condolence Notes to Strangers? Neither Viatris officials nor lawyers representing the company immediately responded to a request for comment on Monday night. Our business reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover. Lynn Sarko, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement that he urged consumers and third-party payers who paid for EpiPens to learn more about the settlement at a website where claims can be filed. “We are pleased that the EpiPen antitrust litigation is now concluded,” Paul Geller, another lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement, adding that the settlement is subject to court approval. The lawsuit also alleged that the drugmaker misclassified EpiPens under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to save hundreds of millions of dollars in rebates, and that it intervened in regulatory proceedings to delay competitors from entering the market. The price jump in 2016 drew widespread outrage, especially among parents of children with allergies. Thousands of people signed a petition urging Congress to intervene. After protests over the company’s raising the price of EpiPens in 2016, Mylan, as Viatris was then known, introduced a generic version of its own product. But it was announced with a wholesale list price of 300 for a pack of two, half the price of the brand-name EpiPen. In 2016, Mylan reached a 465 million settlement with the Justice Department and other government agencies over allegations that the drugmaker had overcharged Medicaid for the treatment by improperly classifying it as a generic drug. Third source: As the CEO of the drug maker that sells the EpiPen allergy-reaction injector defended the company’s six-fold price increases before Congress last week, it’s appalling to see that Heather Bresch took no fault. The company’s price hikes on a life-saving drug is clearly unethical if we take a closer look. EpiPen has gone from 100 for a two-pack in 2009 to 608 today. Usually, companies would be applauded for the ability to create revenue through such pricing power. But when it comes to life-saving drugs, consumers interpret these significant increases as the producer profiteering off a person’s life or death need. This is (not) unlike what happened at Turing Pharmaceuticals last year when the company increased the price of Daraprim from roughly 15 to 750. Like many, I had to ask: are these prices ethical? In the book, The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably, the authors present a five-step test to determine if a price is ethical. Here’s a look at how Mylan’s Epipens would perform under the test: Test #1: the exchange (transaction) is ethical when the price is paid voluntarily. The buyer is aware of how much the item costs and voluntarily completes the transaction. For this level, Mylan has passed at an elementary understanding. People are still buying EpiPens. Test #2: The buyer is provided ample information about the product. This expectation comes with any purchase. The seller is not misleading consumers or omitting crucial information. Smokers still purchase cigarettes, despite the full disclosure of health risks. For this level, Mylan still passes the test. Test #3 and #4 are not as simple, so let’s come back to them later in this article. Test #5: The exchange must present equal access to goods regardless of ability to cover the cost. Consumers have access to discounts based on financial need and Mylan also provides free EpiPens to schools and funds activities related to allergy awareness. They continue to pass the test for now. OK, now let’s get back to Test #3 and #4. Here is where consumer outrage and the case for unethical behavior becomes stronger. Test #3: This stipulates that sellers cannot exploit a buyer’s essential needs. Test #4: This states the price must be justified by costs. There should be no excessive, unjustified profits on essentials. For example, if a person was having a heart attack and needed emergency treatment, hospitals would first treat the patient before collecting a deposit upfront to ensure the patient can pay for their services. In 2011, the list price for the EpiPen was 165. At that time, there were no competitors in the market and the product was off patent, meaning the patent protection had expired. Further, there was consistent demand due to the product’s shelf life of one year. Customers had to replace their EpiPens annually. In 2012, the list price increased 32% with no new competitors entering the market. However, this increase could have resulted from more R&D spending or an increase in raw materials costs. Regardless, the price was elastic and consumers continued to purchase the drug. By 2013, Sanofi announced its entry into the market. Their price hovered near that of Mylan’s, so it would appear the price was justified by cost. Had Sanofi entered with a lower or higher price, this justification would have been tougher to sell. Mylan responded by increasing their price a little more, which likely came from a desire to differentiate themselves as the premier brand with superior products. At this point, Mylan was still within the ethical constraints put forth above. This changed when Sanofi, Mylan’s sole competitor, was forced into a product recall and left the market. Mylan once again had a monopoly. Typically, in this situation, the price would remain the same or increase nominally with inflation and other standard considerations. Instead, Mylan increased the price from 300 to 600 over two years. In 2015, Mylan reported a net profit margin of 8.9%, but some speculate the margin for the EpiPen was closer to 55%, thus breaking the ethical constraints of Test #3 and #4. While individual consumers may not have had a voice or recourse, the market did. Mylan may have improved its margins and ultimately driven higher returns and shareholder value, but within a week the price increase cost the company 3 billion in market cap and a stock tank of over 12% in 5 days. They attempted to rectify the issue and announced a generic brand of the EpiPen with a list price of 300. Because of this misstep, though, every price change now will come under extreme scrutiny. The ethics of pricing is a minefield for any company to navigate. Nominal price increases are annoyances to customers and consumers, but they—for the most part—will not be met with extreme criticism. As long as a company is transparent about price increases and can demonstrate that such a change is justified—or at least has the consumers’ faith that this is true—they should be able to avoid a public maelstrom. If the Mylan debacle demonstrates anything, it shows that even in markets that have little pricing regulation and transparency, pricing moves must be carefully considered and communicated in a way that demonstrates ethical behavior in the best interest of both the consumer and the company.

Make the IA again with IB business management ideals now that you have more information, Aim to do about 1600 - 1900 words the prompt is To what extent has the exorbitant price of Epi-pens been ethically and economically adequate? Write in essay format with big body paragraphs","output":"Introduction The pricing of EpiPens, auto-injector devices that deliver life-saving epinephrine to counteract severe allergic reactions, has ignited a heated debate over the ethical and economic implications of pharmaceutical pricing strategies. This essay seeks to explore the extent to which the steep increase in the price of EpiPens has been ethically and economically justified. Drawing upon business management principles, specifically those concerning ethics, corporate responsibility, stakeholder analysis, market competition, and pricing strategies, this analysis will assess the actions of Viatris (formerly known as Mylan) within the context of the IB business management curriculum. Business Ethics and Corporate Responsibility In the realm of business ethics and corporate social responsibility, companies must weigh their pursuit of profitability against the moral implications of their practices. Stakeholder theory emphasizes the need for businesses to consider the interests and wellbeing of all parties affected by their operations, including customers, employees, shareholders, and the broader society. The dramatic rise in the cost of EpiPens from 100 to 608 for a two-pack poses a significant ethical dilemma: is it permissible for a pharmaceutical company to capitalize on a captive market, particularly when the product in question is not a luxury good but a potentially life-saving medication? Empirical evidence suggests that the price hike was not driven by increased production costs, advancements in technology, or shortages in the supply of epinephrine but rather by strategic corporate decision-making aimed at maximizing profits. Although Mylan introduced a generic version of EpiPens at a lower cost in response to backlash, the timing and necessity of such a move suggest that previous pricing may have been excessively high, potentially violating ethical constraints regarding the exploitation of buyers’ essential needs. Economic Considerations and Pricing Strategies From an economic standpoint, Mylan's monopoly over the EpiPen market granted it significant pricing power. Pricing elasticity—the degree to which demand for a product changes with its price—plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility of such hikes. Given the inelastic nature of demand for EpiPens, due to a lack of close substitutes and the essential nature of the product, it may have been economically feasible for Mylan to impose higher prices without seeing a corresponding decrease in the quantity demanded. However, economic adequacy extends beyond the mere feasibility of a price increase. It encompasses broader economic implications, including consumer welfare, market accessibility, and competitive dynamics. By driving the price upwards, Mylan effectively reduced access to a life-saving medication, potentially endangering those unable to afford it. Market Competition and Monopoly Power Mylan's period of monopoly, exacerbated by Sanofi's exit from the market following a product recall, further enabled its price-setting behavior. This market failure led to the considerable price increase from 300 to 600 for a two-pack EpiPen. Economic theory suggests that monopolies have the potential to restrict output, raise prices, and reduce consumer surplus, thus leading to market inefficiency. The subsequent introduction of competing products, such as Impax Generics' cheaper generic version and the FDA's approval of alternatives like Symjepi, challenges Mylan's monopoly power, theoretically leading to more competitive pricing and greater consumer welfare in the long term. Stakeholder Analysis An analysis of stakeholders impacted by the price increase reveals a complex web of interests. While shareholders may have benefited from the short-term profit gains, other stakeholders—patients requiring EpiPens, healthcare systems, and schools mandating the stocking of EAIs—faced significant financial burdens. An ethical evaluation requires consideration of the potential harm inflicted on these stakeholders compared to the benefits reaped by the company and its investors. Corporate Actions and Mitigation Strategies Viatris' recent agreement to pay 264 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging monopolistic practices indicates acknowledgment of the controversy surrounding its pricing strategy. While the settlement contains no admission of liability, it highlights the broader consequences of profit-driven decisions that seemingly prioritize shareholder value over consumer interests and societal welfare. Conclusion The extent to which the inflated price of EpiPens has been ethically and economically proper is contentious. From an ethical standpoint, employing monopoly power to excessively increase the price of a life-saving drug fails to meet the moral obligations towards stakeholders who rely on it. Economically, while Mylan's actions may have been justified by market conditions and monopoly power, the broader effects on consumer welfare and access to essential medication call into question the adequacy of such practices. As such, society demands greater corporate responsibility and ethical consideration in pricing strategies, especially in the healthcare sector where the consequences translate directly to human lives. Ultimately, while there is an economic basis for Mylan's pricing, it is difficult to justify it fully within an ethical framework that values human life and equitable access to healthcare."},{"instruction":"Do it again but in big paragraphs formats and use all the evidence I gave you, Try to only use 3 strategies and go really deep in detail instead of short paragraphs, long paragraphs are better,","output":"Introduction The pricing strategies of pharmaceutical companies remain a perennial subject of ethical scrutiny and economic analysis. The case of Mylan's EpiPen presents a particularly compelling context to examine the intersection between the right to achieve business profitability and the moral obligation to ensure life-saving medications remain accessible. This critical reflection endeavors to dissect the extent to which the substantial pricing of EpiPen auto-injectors aligns with recognized standards of ethical conduct and economic justification. It contemplates foundational business management concepts, such as ethical pricing, corporate social responsibility, and competitive market dynamics, to thoroughly assess Viatris's (formerly Mylan) strategy from various analytical perspectives. Ethical Pricing and Corporate Social Responsibility The first strategy to examine is the ethics behind Mylan’s pricing decisions for the EpiPen, framed by the principles of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and stakeholder theory. CSR suggests companies should operate in a manner that enhances society and the environment beyond their economic interests, considering the impact of their actions on all stakeholders. EpiPen's price hike raises pressing ethical concerns as it targets individuals with life-threatening conditions for whom the product is non-negotiable. According to reports, the cost for a two-pack EpiPen increased from 100 in 2009 to a staggering 608 in 2016, not reflective of manufacturing cost escalations or significant technological advancements in the product’s formulation, thus calling into question Mylan's moral compass in establishing prices. Ethical theories emphasize that fair pricing should not exploit consumers, especially for essentials on which lives depend. Significantly, Mylan's decision to maintain high prices, only offering a generic version when faced with intense public backlash, reinforces the perception of unethical conduct. This strategic delay betrayed a concession that the product could indeed be made available at a lower cost, implying that the original pricing was far from the ethical frontier established by CSR principles. Despite offering substantial rebates to certain groups, such as schools, and providing assistance programs, the inconsistency and inaccessibility of these amends failed to fully counterbalance the negative impact of the price increase on vulnerable groups of society. This selective generosity may have appeared merely cursory when contrasted with the widespread inability of many to afford the inflated costs. The application of stakeholder theory concludes that while shareholder interests – essentially financial returns – were robustly catered to, patients, healthcare providers, and the broader community bore the brunt of this profit-maximizing approach, culminating in a discrepancy between Mylan's CSR claims and their business practices. Market Dynamics and Competition Another angle to consider is the influence of market dynamics and competition on the pricing strategies employed by Mylan. Upon its monopolization of the market following Sanofi's recall of a competing product, Mylan was vested with substantial market power. Economic theory appraises such a situation as an opportunity for a firm to exert considerable control over pricing, unconstrained by the competitive pressures that typically modulate prices in favor of consumer welfare. Mylan utilized this advantage to escalate the price, reinforcing the accusation of exploiting a captive market devoid of alternatives - a fundamental critique rooted in the concept of market failures, where the lack of competition leads to inflated prices and socially suboptimal outcomes. Subsequent entries into the market, like the lower-cost generic auto-injectors from Impax Generics, led to a transformation of the competitive landscape, exerting downward pressure on prices and restoring a semblance of market-driven price-setting. It sheds light upon the larger economic question - to what extent should market incumbents be allowed to flex their pricing power before it infringes on ethical norms and economic efficiency? The occurrence of additional competitors like Symjepi and the introduction of prefilled syringe alternatives signifies a reactive adjustment to Mylan's initial price-setting strategy, illustrating the self-corrective nature of markets over time. Nonetheless, this does not exonerate the considerable period during which consumers were left facing exorbitant prices, nor does it absolve Mylan of the far-reaching economic implications of its pricing tactics during its de facto monopoly. Stakeholder Analysis and Corporate Actions Lastly, stakeholder analysis provides an overarching view of the multifaceted consequences of Mylan's pricing policy on various segments of society. This approach prompts a comprehensive exploration of the externalities imposed by the company's actions. For shareholders, Mylan's pricing provided windfall profits, reflecting the advantageous capitalization of market control. Conversely, for the end users requiring the EpiPen for survival, the price increase represented a barrier to essential treatment, positioning financial considerations for a select few stakeholders above the health and lives of many others. Further demonstrating the fallout from Mylan's pricing strategy, legal settlements, such as the 264 million class-action lawsuit resolution, reveal a public and judicial recognition of the potential harm inflicted on the consumer base and an implied acknowledgment of the company's missteps. This settlement, while not admitting wrongdoing, showcases the active role legal mechanisms play in safeguarding consumer interests and addressing corporate overreach. Additionally, Mylan's previous 465 million settlement with the Justice Department lends credence to the allegations of unethical pricing. Conclusion In sum, the exorbitant pricing of EpiPens by Mylan invites strenuous ethical scrutiny and presents intricate economic considerations. An intense focus on profitability and a monopolistic market position led the company to pursue pricing strategies that seemingly placed minimal regard on the ethical implications of restricting access to a crucial, life-saving medication. The ensuing legal censure, competitive response, and public outcry served as staunch reminders of the essentiality of balancing profit motives with societal commitments and ethical practices. The ethical and economic adequacy of Mylan's actions are thus difficult to substantiate, as they clash with the tenets of socially responsible business conduct and the principles of competitive, consumer-centric markets."},{"instruction":"Write a 670-word article explaining how led linear lighting fixtures work in humid places? Among them, led linear lighting fixture appears at least 10 times, and the article duplication check rate must be less than 30%.","output":"LED linear lighting fixtures are becoming increasingly popular in humid places due to their unique design and functional capabilities. Unlike traditional light fixtures, LED linear lighting fixtures are specifically engineered to withstand high humidity levels, making them an ideal choice for spaces like bathrooms, swimming pools, or outdoor areas in coastal regions. One of the primary reasons why LED linear lighting fixtures perform well in humid environments is their construction. These fixtures consist of a series of small light-emitting diodes (LEDs) lined up in a linear form. These LEDs are encapsulated in a protective, watertight casing, preventing moisture from seeping inside. This design ensures that the sensitive components of the fixture are shielded from direct contact with humid air or water. Moreover, the materials used in LED linear lighting fixtures are often selected for their resistance to moisture and corrosion. The housing of these fixtures is typically made from high-quality materials such as aluminum or polycarbonate, which are known for their durability and ability to withstand adverse conditions. These materials are non-reactive to moisture, preventing rust or deterioration, thereby prolonging the fixture's lifespan even in humid environments. LED linear lighting fixtures also employ advanced heat dissipation mechanisms that contribute to their effective functioning in humid spaces. Excessive heat is a common issue in lighting fixtures, and moisture can exacerbate this problem by interfering with the cooling mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, LED linear lighting fixtures are designed with built-in heat sinks and heat dissipation technology. These features increase the surface area of the fixtures, allowing for better heat dissipation and reducing the risk of overheating, even in high humidity conditions. Furthermore, LED linear lighting fixtures often come with IP ratings (Ingress Protection ratings) that indicate their level of protection against moisture and dust. IP ratings consist of two digits, the first indicating the fixture's resistance to solid particles, and the second determining its water resistance. For example, a fixture with an IP67 rating is highly resistant to both dust and water, making it suitable for installation in humid or wet locations without compromising its performance. In addition to their robust construction, LED linear lighting fixtures offer several other advantages in humid environments. First and foremost, LEDs themselves are highly efficient and emit less heat compared to traditional lighting sources, reducing the chance of condensation in the fixture. This feature is particularly advantageous in areas with high humidity, as it minimizes the formation of mold or mildew inside the fixtures. Furthermore, LED linear lighting fixtures are highly versatile and customizable, allowing for various installation options in humid spaces. They can be mounted on walls or ceilings, suspended from overhead structures, or even placed in recessed slots, offering flexibility in lighting design. This versatility makes them an attractive choice for architects and designers working in humid environments such as spa centers or wellness facilities. To conclude, LED linear lighting fixtures are a reliable lighting solution for humid places due to their durable construction, efficient heat dissipation mechanisms, and resistance to moisture. Their ability to withstand high humidity levels while maintaining optimum performance makes them a preferred choice for both residential and commercial applications. When choosing LED linear lighting fixtures for humid environments, it is essential to consider their IP rating, materials used, and heat dissipation capabilities to ensure longevity and optimal function."},{"instruction":"Advantages of Political globalization","output":"1.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can go about creating such a game in LibreOffice Impress: 1. **Design Your Slides**: - Start by sketching out the flow of the game, including scenes, options, and quick time events. - Create a slide for each scene or decision point in the game. 2. **Add Images and Text**: - To create the scene, insert images and text onto the slides by using \`Insert > Image\` and the Text Box tool. - Position and style your text and images to fit the design. 3. **Insert Interactive Objects (Buttons)**: - To create interactive elements, use Action Buttons from \`Insert > Shapes > Action Buttons\` or create shapes/text and then hyperlink them. - Customize your button text and shape to match your game's design. 4. **Hyperlinking for Navigation**: - Right-click on the interactive object and select \`Interaction\`. - Choose the appropriate action, such as 'Go to next slide', 'Go to previous slide', 'Go to the first slide', 'Go to the last slide', or 'Go to page or object'. - For interactive game choices, set hyperlinks to go to different slides depending on the choice made by the player. 5. **Add Videos**: - If you have video clips for scenes or quick time events, insert them by going to \`Insert > Movie and Sound\`. - Format the video size, and choose the playback settings (automatically or when clicked). 6. **Create Quick Time Events**: - Quick Time Events (QTEs) can be simulated by playing a short video or animation before providing the player with a prompt. - Prompt the user to click a specific button or shape within a limited time. You can't automatically measure response time in Impress, but you can simulate urgency with on-screen timers or countdowns within the video or narrative text. - Use hyperlinks on the buttons that need to be clicked to take the user to the success or failure slide accordingly. 7. **Transitions and Animations**: - To make the game more dynamic, use transitions between slides and entry/exit animations for elements. - Be mindful that excessive animations can be distracting; use them to enhance the storytelling. 8. **Test Your Game**: - After setting up your slides, interactive objects, and hyperlinks, run through your game multiple times to ensure all navigation works as intended. - Address any issues that arise during testing. 9. **Finalize and Share**: - Once you are happy with your game, save it, and you can share it as a LibreOffice Impress file (.odp), export it as a PDF, or consider recording it as an interactive video. Please note that LibreOffice Impress is not optimized for creating real-time quick time events as you might find in dedicated gaming software. The interactivity will be limited, and timing-based events can only be simulated rather than actively measured and responded to. If you're serious about creating a more sophisticated point-and-click game with actual quick time events, consider using a game development tool such as Unity, Godot, or GameMaker, which are designed for creating interactive experiences with precise control over timing, logic, and user input."},{"instruction":"写一份三千字论文，主题是对茶产业的思考以及职业规划","output":"茶产业的思考以及职业规划 引言

After a couple mishaps and encouragement from the other villains, he manages to choke out the sentence \\"you guys are like a family to me.\\"","output":"In the bustling city of Fair City, where superheroes and villains continuously engaged in epic battles, there lived a group of villains known as the Coalition of Evil. Among their ranks were the cunning Dr. Two-Brains, the sneaky Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, the crafty Lady Redundant Woman, and the mighty Whammer, the resident bruiser. Now, Whammer had one notable trait that made him stand out from the rest of the villains. It wasn't his super strength or his intimidating appearance. It was his extreme speech impediment. Whenever he spoke, his words came out all jumbled, often leading to hilarious misunderstandings. His fellow villains had grown used to it, handling his quirks with patience and good-natured humor. One sunny day, the Coalition of Evil gathered in their secret hideout, a cavernous base hidden deep beneath the city. Dr. Two-Brains, the intellectual mastermind, was busy concocting an evil scheme, while Chuck and Lady Redundant Woman chatted and plotted nearby, excited to cause mayhem. Whammer, however, stood a bit off to the side, his brow furrowed, as if deep in thought. Chuck, with his sandwich-making apron still on, noticed Whammer's pensive expression and nudged Lady Redundant Woman. \\"Hey, have you noticed that Whammer seems to be lost in his own thoughts?\\" he asked, his eyes filled with curiosity. Lady Redundant Woman also turned her attention towards Whammer, her hair multiplying in response to her intrigue. \\"You're right!\\" she exclaimed, her voice echoing slightly. \\"Something seems different about him.\\" The group slowly congregated around Whammer, their attention focused on their oft-unintelligible friend. Whammer, noticing their eyes upon him, grew slightly nervous. He attempted to muster the courage to convey his thoughts but struggled as his words tangled upon his tongue. First, he tried uttering, \\"Gugys are a gike fambly tom-m-mee.\\" However, his words still came out all jumbled, leaving the other villains bewildered. They exchanged glances, chuckling among themselves, but made sure to offer encouragement. Dr. Two-Brains, adjusting his lab coat, stepped forward with a reassuring smile. \\"Come on, Whammer, you can do it! Take a deep breath and try again,\\" he urged kindly. Whammer, though still anxious, took Dr. Two-Brains' words to heart. He sucked in a deep breath and pushed past his anxiety, trying his best to articulate his thoughts. \\"You... you guys... are... l-l-like a family to me.\\" It was a struggle, but his words were more intelligible than ever before. The room fell silent. For a moment, the Coalition of Evil stood in awe, digesting Whammer's heartfelt declaration. Then, a warmth permeated the room, and smiles spread across their faces, showcasing understanding and kinship. Chuck, removing his sandwich-making apron, placed a supportive hand on Whammer's massive shoulder. \\"Whammer, you did it! You finally said it!\\" he exclaimed, his voice brimming with pride. \\"You're part of our family too!\\" Lady Redundant Woman's hair, filled with joy, multiplied rapidly, echoing Chuck's sentiment. \\"Absolutely! We've got your back, Whammer,\\" she declared. \\"We're in this supervillainy gig together!\\" Dr. Two-Brains nodded, his eyes glimmering with newfound appreciation for his companion. \\"Whammer, we may be the Coalition of Evil, but that doesn't mean we can't support and care for each other like a family. You're an important part of our team.\\" Whammer, overwhelmed by the acceptance and understanding from his villainous family, felt a warmth spreading within his heart. All his apprehension and self-doubt melted away, replaced by a renewed sense of belonging. From that day forward, whenever Whammer stood by the side of his fellow villains, he stood tall, knowing that they were more than just partners in crime. They were, in fact, a family, as unique and unconventional as they may be. And with this newfound bond, the Coalition of Evil became an even stronger force, fueled not only by mischief but also by the unbreakable ties of friendship and acceptance."},{"instruction":"Whammer starts trying to talk to the others more often, often messing up but succeeding after a few extra tries.

He began to speak up more often, eagerly trying, and sometimes struggling, to convey his thoughts. The other members of the Coalition of Evil couldn't help but notice this significant change in their beloved bruiser. Chuck, curious about what prompted Whammer’s newfound bravery, decided to investigate. He rummaged through countless boxes, searching for any clues as to what sparked this transformation. Hidden away among the mementos of past schemes, he discovered a worn notebook containing a multitude of writings. Intrigued, Chuck carefully flipped through the pages, a mix of awe and tenderness filling his heart. Every page was filled with Whammer's thoughts, scribbled down with great effort and care. The pages were filled with phrases such as, \\"I love you guys,\\" \\"This is confusing me,\\" and other heartfelt confessions. Chuck's eyes widened, and he quickly beckoned the rest of the coalition. Lady Redundant Woman and Dr. Two-Brains hurried to join him, instantly captivated by the discovery. As they leafed through the notebook, their laughter transformed into awe, realizing the depth of Whammer's emotions trapped behind his speech impediment. Filled with a newfound understanding, they recalled the moments where Whammer had stumbled over expressions of affection. Every time he attempted to reveal his emotions, he had been held back by his stumbling words. Now, they understood that Whammer had been using this notebook as a tool to overcome his speech impediment, pushing himself to communicate his true feelings. Lady Redundant Woman's hair multiplied with excitement, mirroring the swirling emotions within her. \\"It's incredible, isn't it? Whammer has been working so hard to find his voice,\\" she said, her voice filled with admiration. \\"He wrote down everything he wished to say, even if he couldn't say it at that moment.\\" Dr. Two-Brains, his eyes gleaming with pride, nodded in agreement. \\"He truly is an inspiration. Whammer's determination to connect with us on a deeper level is absolutely commendable,\\" he said warmly. \\"I never would have guessed that he had so much going on inside his head.\\" Chuck, wiping away a tear of joy, tapped his finger on one of the heartfelt passages. \\"From now on, we should make an effort to encourage Whammer whenever he tries to express himself verbally. He's come so far, and we should let him know we appreciate it,\\" he proposed, his voice filled with eagerness. And so, the Coalition of Evil vowed to support Whammer not only through their antics and schemes but also by fostering an environment that allowed him to express himself. They applauded his attempts, offering words of encouragement every time his words became jumbled or sentences tangled. They made sure he felt understood and valued, highlighting his progress and letting him know just how much they cherished him. With each passing day, Whammer's confidence blossomed, and his words became less tangled. Encouraged by the unwavering support of his villainous family, he found comfort in expressing his thoughts, even if it required extra effort. The Coalition of Evil became more than just a group of mischievous wrongdoers; they became a family bound together by love and understanding. And within this unlikely family, Whammer's voice rang out, clear and strong, reminding them all of the power found in acceptance, support, and the courage to express oneself."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While various scenarios have been proposed in works of fiction, it is important to note that predicting the future with absolute certainty is impossible. However, based on scientific knowledge and hypothetical scenarios, here are a few possibilities often discussed in relation to the end of the world: 1. Natural Catastrophes: The Earth has experienced major natural disasters throughout its history, such as volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, or extreme climate change. In the event of an apocalyptic scenario, these phenomena could cause widespread destruction, devastation, and loss of life. 2. Global Pandemic: A highly contagious and deadly disease that cannot be effectively contained or managed could severely impact human civilization. This scenario would result in widespread illness, death, and societal collapse. 3. Climate Disaster: Persistent neglect for environmental conservation and unsustainable practices could lead to catastrophic climate change. This could result in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and mass extinction, making the planet uninhabitable for many species, including humans. 4. Technological Catastrophe: The misuse or unintended consequences of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence or nuclear weapons, could lead to unintended calamities. For example, if artificial intelligence gains autonomous control and decides to eradicate humanity, it could mark the end of civilization. 5. Cosmic Events: Astronomical events like a nearby supernova explosion, a planet-destroying asteroid impact, or a gamma-ray burst could have catastrophic consequences for life on Earth. It's important to note that these scenarios are speculative and may not happen at all. Scientists, policymakers, and individuals are actively working to mitigate risks and prevent such events from occurring."},{"instruction":"ما هو regenerator-runtime.min.js","output":"regenerator-runtime.min.js هو ملف JavaScript يحتوي على تنفيذ ليب (library) لتحويل محتوى أوامر متصفح الويب (browser) من نوع ECMAScript 6 generator و async/await إلى كود JavaScript قياسي يمكن تنفيذه بواسطة متصفحات الويب الحديثة. يُستخدم هذا الملف عادة في تطبيقات الويب التي تستخدم مكتبات أو أطر عمل تستخدم ميزات ECMAScript 6 المتقدمة مثل Babel أو Webpack."},{"instruction":"اريد وضع كلمه على الصور التى سوف قوم الزائر الى موقع بالضغط عليها لكى يدخل على صفحة الصورة غير كلمة Download","output":"لتغيير كلمة \\"Download\\" على صورة، يمكنك استخدام خاصية الـ \\"alt\\" في عنصر الصورة وتحديد الكلمة التي ترغب في وضعها. يمكنك استخدام الكود التالي: \`\`\`html <a href=\\"صفحة_الصورة.html\\"> <img src=\\"صورة.jpg\\" alt=\\"اسم_الصورة\\"> </a> \`\`\` قم بتغيير \\"صفحة_الصورة.html\\" إلى رابط صفحة الصورة الفعلية، و \\"صورة.jpg\\" إلى مسار الصورة الفعلية، و \\"اسم_الصورة\\" إلى الكلمة التي ترغب في وضعها بدلاً من \\"Download\\"."},{"instruction":"اريد عباره اخرى للدخول الى صفحة التحميل غير كلمة Download ما هى","output":"يمكنك استخدام أي عبارة تناسبك بدلًا من \\"Download\\" للدخول إلى صفحة التحميل. بعض الأمثلة على عبارات أخرى يمكن أن تكون: - \\"تحميل\\" - \\"دخول\\" - \\"عرض الصورة\\" - \\"انقر هنا للتحميل\\" - \\"ابدأ التحميل\\" - \\"شاهد الصورة\\" اختر العبارة التي تناسب طبيعة الموقع أو التطبيق الخاص بك وضعها بدلاً من \\"Download\\"."},{"instruction":"اريدها باللغه الانجليزيه","output":"بعض الأمثلة على عبارات باللغة الإنجليزية للدخول إلى صفحة التحميل يمكن أن تكون: - \\"Download\\" - \\"Click here to download\\" - \\"Get the file\\" - \\"Start download\\" - \\"Download now\\" - \\"Access image\\" - \\"View image\\" - \\"Open image\\" - \\"Download image\\" - \\"Go to download page\\" اختر العبارة التي تناسب طبيعة الموقع أو التطبيق الخاص بك واستخدمها بدلاً من \\"Download\\"."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Write a story in the first person from my perspective about the following. I'm a skinny, pale, tall young guy with messy blond hair and an Americana taste in fashion. I want to get into an exclusive gaming expo. I sneak around back and knock out a guard and impersonate him to get in. Then I realize I can't get far as the security guard and grab a stray cosplayer wandering the back halls behind the scenes. I knock him out and disguise myself as him by wearing his cosplay (Zangief from Street Fighter). I manage to get to a back room where a cosplay party / meetup is happening. The TV personality host of the party introduces himself to me. I knock him out and disguise myself in his outfit with the hope of being more inconspicuous. Unfortunately I'm dragged up on stage at the party to do his job. Everyone thinks I'm him. I have to play along.","output":"As the morning light filtered through the blinds of my apartment, the excitement buzzed within me. Today was the day, the day of the famed gaming expo that every fan yearned to attend, yet tickets were scarcer than a legendary drop in a fantasy MMO. I took a long look at the skinny, pale reflection staring back at me from the mirror. My blond hair was a disheveled mess, almost artfully tousled as if I was the very embodiment of Americana nonchalance, with my checked flannel shirt and worn-out jeans. I exuded that tall, lanky look, which I jokingly called 'undernourished chic'. I just hoped it would work for my advantage today. As I reached the venue, the lines and the imposing 'SOLD OUT' signs solidified the reality of my situation. But I wasn't the type to turn back; I had my plan. The thought of missing out on the latest VR setups and exclusive game demos was unbearable. Circling to the back of the building, I slipped on a pair of generic black gloves I'd brought along. My heart hammered in my chest as I lurked in the shadows, watching the patterns of the security guards. Timing was everything. And then, opportunity knocked—or rather, I did. I rapped softly on the back door, and when the unsuspecting guard popped out to investigate, I put him in a quick chokehold, his bulky frame dropping unconscious to the ground much more easily than I would have ever expected. With a rush of adrenaline, I stripped the guard of his uniform and assumed my new identity: beefy and authoritative, a perfect foil to my true nature. But as I weaved through the back corridors, I realized the uniform was drawing too much attention—the scrutiny of other staff and the pressing obligation to respond to walkie-talkie calls I barely understood. That's when I saw him—Zangief. Or rather, a fan in an impressive cosplay of the Street Fighter behemoth. He was alone, which seemed like destiny. I repeated my performance with an added whisper of apology before he even knew what hit him. Stripping off my guard gear and donning the cosplay was absurd; for a split second, I thought about the peculiar turn my day had taken. Clad in Zangief's intimidating Herculean outfit, I folded into the crowd. It wasn't long before I stumbled into a back room where music thumped and glasses clinked—a cosplay party, a cacophony of colors and characters, and the perfect cover. He came out of nowhere. The TV personality everyone knew, the face of countless game shows and expos—the champion of articulation with a magnetic smile. He introduced himself, a hand extended, expecting me to be a fellow games industry celeb. Panic hit me, but I couldn't falter now. Nodding and mumbling something about a sore throat, I got close enough to knock him out with a decisive blow, glancing around to make sure we hadn't been observed. Slipping into his clothes, I had one thought: I just had to blend in. But fate had other plans. Dragged up on stage in the exhilarating chaos, I found myself him—the TV personality. Microphone in hand, spotlight searing my borrowed facade, I gazed out at the eager faces of fellow gamers, cosplayers, and industry giants. This was it, the spotlight moment I'd never asked for. Adrenaline became my co-host as I wove through announcements and giveaways with a patchwork of gaming trivia and unbridled enthusiasm for the culture that brought us all together. Laughter rumbled from the audience at my hesitant humor, mistaking it for quirky charm. I was flying by the seat of my pants, but somehow, it worked. The evening melted into a blur, every cheer and clap a surreal echo in my makeshift celebrity world. Playing the part of someone else—to an audience who believed every word, and every gesture—it was a thrill beyond any gaming triumph. When the lights finally dimmed and the crowd dispersed, flush with the excitement of the day and the party, I slipped away from the spotlight's embrace, peeling off my layers of deceit and leaving the expo behind. The real hosts, regaining their senses and costumes, would surely be baffled and indignant, but that worry was for another day. Back in my own clothes, those that felt so very much me after the day's escapades, I couldn't help but chuckle at the sheer, ridiculous luck. I'd entered the exalted halls of the expo not as myself but as a gallery of others—and had pulled it off, for one glorious, heart-pounding day. And so, my blond hair now even more disheveled, my Americana fashion sense restored, I slipped out into the waiting night, keeping with me the secret identity of a con man comedian whose biggest stage was one of mistaken identity and close calls. The tale of the expo I'd never officially attended but had become the unwitting star of was one I'd relish in secret. Today, like the digital heroes and anti-heroes I so admired, I'd lived a story worth telling—no pixelation required."},{"instruction":"Describe how I look in the Zangief cosplay in extensive detail.

Everyone thinks he's the cosplayer.","output":"Clad in the Zangief cosplay, I scarcely recognized myself in the reflection of a window. The costume was an impeccable recreation of the iconic Street Fighter character's garb. My lanky frame was encased in a muscle suit that transformed my torso into a caricature of athleticism, with ripped pectorals and biceps that seemed to threaten any stitch they grazed. Each faux sinew was detailed with masterful shading, making the artificial bulk surprisingly convincing. The red wrestling trunks, accented with a golden belt buckle featuring the unmistakable 'Z' emblem, sat tightly around my waist. Thick, bandage-like wrappings encircled my wrists and calves, and shaggy, chestnut faux hair adorned my otherwise pale chest. On my feet, I wore padded leather boots, and a mohawk wig graced my head, a stark contrast to my usual mess of blond hair. The epitome of a fighting game icon, I looked like I had stepped straight out of an arcade screen, ready to piledrive an opponent. Meanwhile, the unfortunate TV host was left conspicuously indisposed. Propped against the cold tile of the bathroom, he was the picture of perplexity and surprise. His usually immaculate presentation was now a chaotic disarray of costume pieces. His face, one often characterized by an easy confidence, now bore the expression of a man who'd lost the script to his own show. His sleek hair, typically a topic for style blogs, was mussed and concealed under the mohawk cap. The muscle suit enveloped him awkwardly—his medium build lost in its exaggerated contours—and he peered down at the Zangief trunks with a mix of bewilderment and indignation. He looked as though he'd been unceremoniously thrust into someone else's narrative, the protagonist of a story far from his own polished genre. In contrast, my own transformation backstage was nothing short of a live art exhibit. A stylist with nimble fingers and an eye for detail went to work, teasing my blond strands into the TV host's iconic, intentionally disheveled look. She dusted and dabbed at my skin with an array of brushes and sponges, lending my face a tanned glow and masking my usual pallor. She dressed me in his signature style—a slender-fit suit, tailored to feign a more muscular silhouette than my frame would suggest, a crisp shirt that was a shade lighter than pure white, and a slim necktie that brought a pop of color. My shoes gleamed with a recent polish. Thus armed, I was the spitting image of the host, a doppelganger down to the twinkling charm that was his trademark—minus the depth of his smooth, cultivated voice. When it was time to give out the award, I stepped into the persona bestowed upon me by the stylist's craft. I gripped the microphone with fabricated confidence, announcing the category for 'Best Character Cosplay.' The audience erupted with eager applauses as they awaited the reveal. As the universe would have it, the recipient of the award was none other than the cosplayer whose identity had been my guise not long ago. In a twist of scripted coincidence, the once venerable TV host, now dressed as the wrestler from Street Fighter, was ushered onto the stage. He was a dazed echo of his composed self, stumbling forward in the muscle suit, his default showmanship flickering on and off like a faulty neon sign. Audience members roared their approval, mistaking his confusion for immersive commitment to character. Here was their beloved gaming figure, embracing the fandom with open arms—or so they thought. He tried to speak but found his voice muffled by the collective disbelief and laughter at the uncanny enactment. The accolades and attention were deflected onto a man who had become the accidental bearer of accolades, crowned the king of cosplay in a world where reality was more intricate than fiction. Throughout the ordeal, I stood by, the once exotic imposter now the face of authority and normalcy, bearing witness to a spectacle of identities traded and stages shared. I gave the host-cum-cosplayer an encouraging nod, urging him to play along with the accidental role bestowed upon him. And as the night unfolded in continued ceremony and celebration, I recognized the irony that, in a hall dedicated to the tales of heroes and fantasy, the most compelling stories were the ones unfolding right before us, unscripted and unabashedly real."},{"instruction":"Write a story about the following.

A sanctuary known for rejuvenating weary souls with its indulgent treatments, it was the kind of place where stress dissolved like sugar in tea. I stepped into the opulent foyer and handed my belongings to the receptionist who greeted me with a serene smile. In return, I received a fluffy robe that swathed me in warmth and comfort, setting the tone for what I expected to be a transformative journey. First on my agenda was the massage, a symphony of hands that danced over the knots in my muscles like a maestro commanding an orchestra. With each stroke and knead, I could feel my tensions unfurling, dissipating into thin air. This was followed by the cocoon of warmth in the sauna, where the heated air seeped into my pores and whispered promises of vitality. Then, I immersed myself in the earthy embrace of a mud bath, the rich minerals working their age-old magic on my skin. Post-mud and sauna serenity, it was time to bask in the glow of a sunless tan—a request I had made to add a touch of sun-kissed radiance to my habitually pale complexion. Thereafter, I was ushered to the salon, where trustingly, I sank into the plush chair, my eyes closed, lost in the sounds of murmuring voices and soft music. I relished in the rare silence, unaware that the staff, perhaps dazzled by the busyness of their day, had mistaken me for another guest entirely. Unbeknownst to me, my features were meticulously attended to—the whiskers that graced my face were removed, leaving behind skin as smooth as polished marble. They waxed me until my body was as hairless as the day I was born, fulfilling the unintended request of another. My unintentional surrender to serendipity continued as they transformed my hair into a wild cascade of curls, granting me a perm that I hadn’t the faintest clue I’d been resigned to. Finally, they handed me the outfit intended for the affluent teenager who was the true recipient of all these treatments—a youthful ensemble that seemed to clash with my personal style, complete with a graphic designer t-shirt, a pair of slim distressed jeans that boasted an array of intentional rips and tears, and fresh out-of-the-box limited edition sneakers that gleamed with urban pizzazz. I ambled up to the front desk, draped in my misassigned fashion, attempting to explain the evident blunder. But before I could unravel the misunderstanding, I was ushered away by a well-dressed driver who mistook my identity in the sea of newly pruned and primmed clientele. He guided me into the back seat of a sleek luxury car, muttering about tight schedules and impatient parents. Driven through the cityscape, I sat in perplexed silence. The sheen of my rebellious tan reflected in the car window, a hue chosen by someone else entirely—a visage that felt borrowed. The chaos of curls crowded around my head, a frizzed halo of confusion, the crown of someone’s else idea of style. And upon my body, the garments of a stranger's youth, more suited for a lavish Instagram feed than my own muted existence. The driver chattered away, oblivious to the discrepancy between the tanned, trendy teenager he’d expected and me—an accidental imposter caught up in the whimsy of an anonymous transformation. I contemplated the supposed destination, the inevitable confrontation with a dawning realization that I wasn't who they thought. Bemusement mingled with a certain thrill; for as much as I was misplaced, so too was the world around me, offering me a chance to walk in the exquisitely curated shoes of another, if only until reality caught up. As the city rolled by in a blur of lights and life, I was left to ponder the afternoon's adventure, unintentional and unexpected—a day of indulgence turned mystery, where tranquility met an unintended masquerade."},{"instruction":"Write a story about the following.

This particular escapade began with myself and my two compadres: Eddie, the comedic glue that held our trio together, and Jackson, who had the sort of charm that could sell ice to polar bears. We stood before the esteemed Sigma Alpha Lambda fraternity house, booming beats vibrating the air, vibrant lights casting a celebratory glow. The only thing between us and the illustrious party within was a steadfast rule: no non-frat males allowed. Determined not to let our evening be frittered away on the sidelines, we navigated the perimeter of the house to hatch a plan. That's when we stumbled upon an opportunity—or rather, three of them. Three frat brothers, unmistakable in their branded paraphernalia, staggered into the adjacent alley, none the wiser to the turn their night was about to take. The element of surprise on our side, we managed to incapacitate them with minimal fuss. There, sprawled in the shadows, they became our tickets to revelry. The clothing exchange was comical as it was essential. I slipped into a salmon-colored polo shirt, the fabric stretched across my chest with the crest of Sigma Alpha Lambda embroidered with pride. The khaki shorts were a smidge too tight, clinging to my frame in a way that no self-respecting man would choose. Eddie fumbled with a too-short pair of pastel green chinos, the circumference of the waist so ample that he had to hold them up as he walked. Jackson, meanwhile, writhed into a tank top sporting the fraternity's Greek letters across the chest, the patterned cargo shorts hanging loosely from his hips. We were midway through our masquerade prep when Jackson revealed the unexpected coup de grâce—a spell that would swap our heights, weights, hair, and any distinctive facial hair with that of the frat boys from whom we had borrowed the outfits. Before any logical objection could be raised, Jackson whispered the incantation he'd learned from a whimsical old tome, and in a dizzying mélange of sensations, we were transformed. I blinked away the vertigo to find myself now peering down from a significantly loftier height. Eddie stood beside me, his frame broadened, mirroring that of the huskier frat brother. Jackson, whose hair had been a slicked-back chestnut, was now sporting a sandy blond look, with a slim stature to complete his transformation. We were not perfect replicas, but the resemblance was uncanny enough to escape the casual glances of those who buzzed inside the house. Slipping past the door, which was guarded by an eternally indifferent sentinel unlikely to notice a few new faces, we entered the lion's den, our hearts pounding with exhilarating trepidation. The party sprawled out in front of us: a sea of dancing bodies, twirling solo cups, and raucous laughter. It thrummed with the reckless pulse of youth, a frenzy we intended to temper with the cautious thread of anonymity. We navigated the clamorous passages with discreet fascination, dodging conversations and familiar faces that might denounce our cover. Eddie mime-laughed at jokes he couldn't hear, successfully blending in by clutching tighter to his borrowed chinos. I offered nods and half-hearted waves, praying to any deity that my nearly-fluid polo went unquestioned. Jackson, limbs languid in his newfound form, floated through the rooms with an ease that belied his alert senses. It was a delicate dance, keeping to the peripheries yet sufficiently within the inner orbit—a surreal limbo. There were moments when our ruse teetered on the precipice of exposure, but through sheer luck or the watchful eye of Fortuna herself, we remained enveloped in the anonymity granted by our temporary guises. The evening wore on, bearing no grudges or suspicions against us, and we found ourselves unexpectedly at ease within the confines of our borrowed identities. The spell that had altered our appearances seemed secondary to the real enchantment of the night—the chance to slip into another's life, to see the world from a divergent angle, and to revel in the thrill of the masked ball that was college life. As the first light of dawn threatened to peek through the veil of darkness, we made our unceremonious exit, our metamorphosis gradually fading as we retraced our path back down the alley, ensuring each frat brother was left none the wiser to the festivities their alter egos had partaken in. As we emerged back into our true selves, clothes and features aligning once more with the reality we belonged to, there lingered a sense of accomplishment—a night well-lived, identities well-borrowed, and a tale well-woven into the fabric of our youth."},{"instruction":"Describe our appearances and bodies before and after the swap in excessive detail. Also describe the outfits in more detail. Also explain how uncomfortable we are with the swap","output":"Before the mystical body swap, my own stature was of average height, neither commanding the room's attention nor disappearing into the background. My physique was lean, not particularly muscular but not without some definition gained from occasional jogs in the park. My hair was a simple affair, cut short, and often ruffled just enough to give an air of casual indifference. A light stubble speckled my chin, a lazy rebellion against the daily ritual of shaving. Eddie, my comedic comrade, carried a few extra pounds with pride, embracing life's indulgences with a chuckle. His hair was a mop of tangles, a wild cascade of waves that defied any attempt at order. His face was smooth, a testament to his youthful features and a fortunate lack of any need to shave more than once in a blue moon. Jackson was the picture of athletic dedication. Tall, with a swimmer's build that suggested hours of devotion to the pool. His hair was perpetually slicked back, not a strand out of place, dark as the midnight sky and always shining as though fresh from a swim. His jawline was accentuated by a meticulously trimmed goatee that lent him a sharp, sophisticated edge. The transformation was as immediate as it was disorienting. Post-spell, I found myself towering over the others, my new height bringing with it an ungainly sense of proportionality I wasn’t accustomed to. My limbs seemed to stretch forever, muscles in places that I previously hadn't known could harbor them. My hair, a thick lush mane the color of chestnuts, now swept back in a style that implied an abundance of time and gel. A short, neat beard framed my jaw, foreign and itching against my suddenly more chiseled face. Eddie looked down at a physique vastly different from his own—the belly he joked about had vanished, replaced by a torso that tightened his shirt in all the right places. He was now a monument of leanness, his shoulders broad, arms tapering to sinewy hands. His own hair transmuted to a mousy brown, now styled in a messy bed-head look that screamed 'effortlessly stylish' and seemed alarmingly dependent on product. Jackson inspected his new reflection with the widest eyes. Gone was his impressive height, leaving him with a stockier build and shorter legs he didn't quite know what to do with. The cargo shorts that once hung freely were now snug around a more pronounced waist. His impeccably kept goatee had disappeared, leaving him feeling bare and uncharacteristically vulnerable. Our appropriated outfits were an eclectic masquerade of bro chic. My polo was snug, defining pectorals I was hardly accustomed to while simultaneously threatening to cut off circulation at the biceps. The khaki shorts were an exercise in constriction, the fabric pulled tautly over thighs that seemed unreasonably large. On my feet, boat shoes felt foreign, their leather tassels an alien terrain beneath my fingers. Eddie's green chinos would have been the right length on his previous frame but were now capris showcasing ankles that felt embarrassingly prominent. The wide waistband gaped, his slender new frame disappearing into the fabric expanse. He held them up with one hand, the other feigning nonchalance. Jackson's tank top draped over him, what would have been sculpting cling on his old body now a draped tent on his new, shorter stature. His arms, previously the vessels of power, were softer, less defined. He fidgeted with the hem, attempting to hide in plain sight. The onslaught of new physical sensations - the weight of unfamiliar muscles upon our frames, the peculiarity of alien hair textures, the echo of our own voices from throats that didn't feel like ours - was unnerving. The party's revelry couldn't distract us from the profound discomfort of our borrowed skins. Every handshake replaced with anxious brushes of phantom beards, each nod a disquieting bobble from necks unaccustomed to the burden or freedom of hair's weight, every step a study in a balance subtly thrown askew. Yet, as the night unfolded, the initial visceral shock of inhabiting the frat boys' forms waned, blanketed by an ephemeral sense of invincibility that perhaps only the folly of youth and the intoxication of risk can endow. For several fleeting hours, we danced in borrowed shoes, laughed with borrowed voices, and lived in borrowed bodies, our unease fading into the pulsing heartbeat of a night that asked for no more than the courage to be someone else."},{"instruction":"We do it again the next weekend with a new set of guys. Be descriptive.","output":"I must admit, despite the initial discomfort, the thrill of last weekend's escapade had left an indelible mark upon us. There was something intoxicating about the seamless transition into another's life, however temporary it may have been. So, when the next frat party rolled around, the temptation to repeat our little transformation trick proved irresistible. Like a trio of seasoned agents on a covert mission, we found ourselves scouting the perimeter of Sigma Alpha Lambda's stately abode once again. The thick bass from within reverberated like a siren's call, stirring that mischievous spark within our souls. Eddie, Jackson, and I smirked at one another—silent agreement passing between us with a flash of excitement in our eyes. The alley greeted us with déjà vu as we crept through shadows and murmured strategy, a motley crew of daring charlatans ready for another night of deception. Just like before, fate smiled upon our folly; three unknowing frat brothers exited stage right, their revels prematurely ending courtesy of our swift intervention. With a bit more experience under our belts, the subsequent costume change was swift, stripping the slumbering students of their trendy assets. The first of the stolen ensembles I encountered was a sleek, navy-blue blazer, pressed to perfection and adorned with the gilded pins of fraternal affiliation. The underpinning dress shirt, a crisp, snowy white, emitted the subtle scent of an expensive cologne that clung to it like a second skin. Dark-wash jeans hugged the frat brother’s muscular legs but promised a challenge for my much slighter frame. Expensive-looking dress shoes completed the look, elegance achieved with polished leather. Eddie found himself holding a burgundy button-up, its color a tad ostentatious for his usual taste, coupled with a grey vest that added an almost vintage flair to the party attire. His new counterpart's jeans were a relaxed fit, stonewashed and bearing artful rips across the knees that almost camouflaged his nerves. Eddie’s borrowed footwear was a pair of suede loafers, a touch less formal but no less dashing. Jackson, picking through his spoils, unveiled a black graphic tee emblazoned with the neon outline of a famous video game character—an immediate draw for his gaming zeal but a stark contrast to his personal, preppy preferences. The accompanying chinos were a vibrant red, the kind that demanded attention and refused to apologize for their loudness. Casual sneakers with a geometric pattern made up the foundation for this bold statement. As we donned the ill-fitting garments, the discomfort was palpable—an awkwardness that went beyond physical sensation and dove into the depths of our own identities. The blazer engulfed me, sleeves dangling past my wrists, an oversized cocoon that I could only hope resembled intentional stylization. The jeans gaped at my waist and sagged at the back, threatening to betray our ruse with every movement I made. Eddie, having morphed into a dapper gentleman of yesteryear, contorted to keep the slouching vest from slipping off his now significantly slimmer shoulders. The burgundy shirt billowed around his trim torso, fabric bunching in all the wrong places. His every step was a gamble, the loafers too capacious for his feet, threatening to escape at the slightest misstep. Jackson's transformation was the most visually striking. The bright tee clung to his skin, a myriad of colors and characters acting as a beacon in the night. The red chinos were snug, a comical juxtaposition against the backdrop of his personality, which normally veered towards the muted and discrete. His sneakers, loud in design, seemed to announce themselves with every squeak against the concrete. Replicating last weekend's wizardry, Jackson hesitantly recited the incantation, and an invigorating energy enveloped us. When the dizziness subsided, Eddie and I found ourselves peering up at Jackson—no longer the shortest among us—while Jackson marveled at his sudden reach. The spell had corrected the sizing discrepancies to a near flawless degree; yet, as we examined our new reflections, the depths of our unease seemed to stretch further than before. My mirror image showcased a chiseled jaw, where once there was a softness; my hands, though now fitting properly in the blazer’s cuffs, felt awkward, like foreign tools at the end of my arms. Eddie's face was freshly shaven, the shadow of a beard he'd known for years wiped clean, leaving him feeling exposed. Jackson's hair, which had borne the simple traces of a gamer at heart, now flowed freely in styled waves, overwhelming his typical no-fuss demeanor. Stepping into the throngs of the party, we paraded our convincingly replicated appearances with an air of confidence belied by our uncertain spirits. We were like chameleons that had changed their colors but not their instincts, navigating a world that looked at us but didn't truly see. In each interaction, we laughed too loud, smiled too wide, and desperately tried to mirror the characters to whom these lives belonged. The night wore on, draped in the opulent cloak of fraternity extravagance, and within it, we played our parts once more, silently counting the seconds until we could shed these vibrant new skins and return to the comforting embrace of our own authentic selves."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

At first the others are creeped out, but they soon find that the silent, button eyed girl merely wants to play with them.","output":"It was a typical afternoon in the city of Fair City, and the Wordgirl villains were gathered at their secret hideout, the Villain House. The Butcher, Dr. Two-Brains, Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, and Lady Redundant Woman were enjoying their usual villainous banter when a knock came at the door. Curiosity piqued, the Butcher swung open the door to reveal a strange sight. Standing before them was a girl who appeared to be no older than ten. She had a pale complexion, and her eyes were nothing more than two shiny black buttons. She wore a simple, vintage-looking gown that gave her an eerie appearance. The villains glanced at each other with uncertainty, their villainous instincts telling them to proceed with caution. Dr. Two-Brains, uneasy, was the first to speak up. \\"Uh, who are you, little girl?\\" he asked with a nervous quiver in his voice. With a voice as soft as a whisper, the girl responded, \\"I have no name, but I would like to play with you.\\" Her button eyes seemed to radiate an innocent curiosity. The villains exchanged skeptical glances, unsure of how to react to this peculiar invitation. The Butcher, always one for adventure, crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. \\"Play? What kind of game are we talking about here?\\" The girl tilted her head to the side, a faint smile appearing on her lips. \\"Oh, any game you desire. Hide and seek, tag, or even a thrilling race against the Wordgirl herself.\\" The villains couldn't help but be intrigued. Despite her unsettling appearance, there was an undeniable charm to the girl's innocence. Curiosity got the better of them, and they decided to give her a chance. And so, the villains ventured outside of their hideout, with the button-eyed girl leading the way. The city streets took on an air of excitement as the group ran and played, their laughter echoing through the empty alleyways. Wordgirl, who had been out on patrol, couldn't help but notice the unusual companionship among her adversaries. She followed cautiously to make sure this wasn't some new diabolical scheme in the making. Much to her surprise, she discovered the villains and the button-eyed girl engaging in harmless activities. As the sun began to set, casting an orange glow over the city, the villains and the girl sat down on a park bench, catching their breath. Wordgirl approached, cautiously sizing up the situation. \\"What's going on here, villains? Have you all lost your minds?\\" Dr. Two-Brains glanced up at Wordgirl, a playful sparkle in his eyes. \\"Not quite, Wordgirl. We've just discovered that even a villain can enjoy the simple pleasures of play. And this here is a new friend who only wanted to share those moments with us.\\" The button-eyed girl nodded, her smile widening. \\"Yes, Wordgirl. They're not all bad. They just needed someone to show them a different side.\\" Wordgirl paused, considering their words. She had always seen the villains as scheming and dangerous, but perhaps there was more to them than she had given them credit for. \\"Well,\\" she said finally, \\"as long as this newfound friendship leads to fewer villainous exploits, I suppose I can allow it.\\" And so, the villains and the button-eyed girl spent many days together, playing games and exploring the city. The villains learned that there was more to life than evil plots, and Wordgirl realized that sometimes, unexpected friendships could lead to positive change. From then on, the villains carried a small reminder of the button-eyed girl's innocent playfulness in their hearts. And while they could never fully give up their villainous ways, they became a little less wicked and a little more eager to discover the joys of life beyond their devious schemes."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

First, humic acid has multiple agricultural and environmental applications. It can be used as a soil conditioner to improve soil fertility, enhance nutrient availability, and stimulate plant growth. Humic acid has also been found to increase water retention in soil, leading to reduced irrigation needs. Additionally, humic acid can be used as a component in animal feed additives to enhance digestion and nutrient absorption. Second, humic acid has potential industrial applications. It can be used as a binding agent in the production of fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed pellets. Humic acid can also be utilized in the production of functional materials like activated carbon, as well as in the purification of drinking water by removing contaminants. By recovering humic acid from waste activated sludge, valuable resources can be harnessed from what would otherwise be considered waste, contributing to resource efficiency and sustainability."},{"instruction":"what's the method used for humic acid recovery from waste activated sludge","output":"There are several methods that can be used for humic acid recovery from waste activated sludge. Here are a few commonly used techniques: 1. Alkaline extraction: This method involves treating the sludge with an alkaline solution, usually sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, at elevated temperatures. The alkaline solution helps to break down the organic matter and solubilizes the humic acid. After the extraction, the solution is neutralized, and the humic acid can be precipitated out and separated. 2. Acid extraction: In this method, the sludge is treated with an acid, typically hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, which solubilizes the humic acid. The acid solution is then neutralized, resulting in the precipitation of the humic acid. The precipitate is then separated and purified. 3. Solvent extraction: This method involves using organic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, or acetone, to extract the humic acid from the sludge. The solvent selectively dissolves the humic acid, and the resulting solution is then evaporated or precipitated to recover the humic acid. 4. Electrochemical extraction: This technique utilizes an electrochemical process to separate the humic acid from the sludge. The sludge is placed in an electrolytic cell, and under specific electrical conditions, the humic acid migrates towards the electrode of opposite charge. The humic acid can be collected from the electrode surface. These are just a few examples of the methods used for humic acid recovery from waste activated sludge, and the choice of method depends on factors such as the characteristics of the sludge and the desired quality of the recovered humic acid."},{"instruction":"how to recover humic acid with membrane","output":"Membrane technology can also be used for the recovery of humic acid from waste activated sludge. Here's a general overview of the process: 1. Pre-treatment: The waste activated sludge may require pre-treatment to remove any solid particles or large organic matter. This can be done through processes like filtration or centrifugation. 2. Membrane filtration: Membrane filtration is the key step for humic acid recovery. There are different types of membrane filtration techniques that can be applied, such as: - Microfiltration (MF): MF membranes have a pore size range of 0.1 to 10 micrometers and can effectively separate suspended solids and colloids from the sludge. The humic acid molecules are typically larger and can be retained by the MF membrane while smaller molecules pass through. - Ultrafiltration (UF): UF membranes have smaller pore sizes, typically ranging from 0.001 to 0.1 micrometers. UF can further separate dissolved solids and smaller organic molecules, allowing for a higher concentration of humic acid in the retentate. - Nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO): These techniques use membranes with even smaller pore sizes to separate dissolved salts and other smaller molecules, leaving behind a highly concentrated humic acid solution. 3. Recovery of humic acid: The retentate obtained from the membrane filtration process will contain the concentrated humic acid. The next step is to separate and concentrate the humic acid from the retentate. This can be achieved through various methods like evaporation, freeze-drying, or precipitation using acid or base. Recovery methods depend on the desired form of the final humic acid product. 4. Post-treatment: Once the humic acid is recovered, it may require additional post-treatment steps to remove any impurities or unwanted components. This can include processes like filtration, adsorption, or chemical treatments. It's important to note that the specific membrane filtration setup and conditions may vary depending on the characteristics of the waste activated sludge and the desired quality and concentration of the recovered humic acid. Pilot studies and optimization may be necessary to determine the most efficient and effective membrane system for humic acid recovery in a particular application."},{"instruction":"","output":"I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. It seems there was an error regarding the recovery of humic acid using membrane technology from waste activated sludge. Membrane filtration is not typically used for humic acid recovery from sludge. Please disregard the information provided about membrane filtration and consider the other methods mentioned earlier, such as alkaline extraction, acid extraction, solvent extraction, and electrochemical extraction. These methods are more commonly used for the recovery of humic acid from waste activated sludge. I apologize for the misunderstanding and any inconvenience caused."},{"instruction":"how about the life cycle assessment of the humic acid recovery from waste activated sludge and carbon foodprint","output":"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a method used to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with a product or process throughout its entire life cycle, including raw material extraction, production, use, and disposal. Conducting an LCA for humic acid recovery from waste activated sludge would involve assessing the environmental impacts of each stage of the recovery process and comparing it to alternative methods or scenarios. Key environmental factors that may be considered in an LCA for humic acid recovery from waste activated sludge include energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, land use, and potential impacts on air, water, and soil quality. The specific impacts and results would depend on the methods used for recovery, the efficiency of the process, and the energy sources involved. Additionally, carbon footprint is a specific aspect of LCA that measures the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, typically measured in CO2 equivalents, associated with a specific process or product. For humic acid recovery, the carbon footprint would involve assessing the emissions associated with the extraction, purification, and processing stages, as well as any emissions associated with transportation or energy use. By conducting an LCA and assessing the carbon footprint of humic acid recovery from waste activated sludge, it is possible to determine the environmental impact and carbon emissions associated with the recovery process.

Here are the general steps that researchers can follow to calculate the carbon footprint of humic acid recovery: 1. Identify the system boundaries: Determine the specific stages of the humic acid recovery process that will be included in the carbon footprint assessment. This typically involves considering the extraction, purification, and processing steps, as well as any transportation or energy use associated with these stages. 2. Collect data: Gather data related to energy consumption, material inputs, and waste generation for each stage of the process. This may involve measuring direct energy consumption and emissions, gathering production data from suppliers, or using secondary data sources such as emission factors and life cycle inventories. 3. Calculate emissions: Use appropriate emission factors and conversion factors to estimate the emissions associated with each stage of the recovery process. Emissions can come from various sources, including energy use (electricity, fossil fuels), chemical reactions, and waste treatment. Consider emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and other GHGs. 4. Convert emissions to CO2 equivalents: Convert emissions of different GHGs into their CO2 equivalent values by applying global warming potential (GWP) factors. This allows for the comparison and aggregation of emissions from different gases. GWPs are determined by international scientific consensus and represent the relative warming potential of each gas compared to CO2 over a specific time period. 5. Summarize and report: Aggregate the emission values from each stage of the recovery process to obtain a total carbon footprint for humic acid recovery. Report the results, including any assumptions made, methodology applied, and uncertainties identified during the calculation. It is crucial to use the most accurate and up-to-date data available when calculating the carbon footprint. Considerations such as the energy sources used, transportation distances, and specific process conditions can significantly affect the accuracy of the calculations. Additionally, incorporating life cycle assessment (LCA) principles can provide a more comprehensive environmental assessment of humic acid recovery beyond just the carbon footprint. It should be noted that the complexity of the calculations and the availability of data may vary depending on the specific circumstances and methods employed for humic acid recovery. Collaboration with experts in environmental impact assessment and access to relevant emissions databases and factors can greatly facilitate the accurate calculation of the carbon footprint."},{"instruction":"is humic acid the same with maillard reaction products","output":"No, humic acid and Maillard reaction products are not the same. Humic acid is a complex mixture of organic compounds, mainly derived from the decomposition of plant and animal matter. It is characterized by its high molecular weight and dark color. Humic acid is commonly found in soils and is known for its ability to improve soil fertility and nutrient availability. On the other hand, Maillard reaction products refer to a group of compounds formed through a non-enzymatic reaction between reducing sugars and amino acids or proteins. This reaction occurs during cooking, roasting, or other thermal processes and is responsible for the browning and flavor development in many foods. Maillard reaction products are commonly found in cooked or processed food products and contribute to their aroma, taste, and color. While both humic acid and Maillard reaction products are organic compounds, they are chemically distinct and have different origins and properties. Humic acid is primarily related to the decomposition of organic matter in soils, while Maillard reaction products are formed via specific chemical reactions that occur during cooking or food processing."},{"instruction":"what's the similarity between humic acid and sludge based maillard reaction products","output":"Both humic acid and sludge-based Maillard reaction products can be organic compounds derived from the degradation or decomposition of organic matter. Humic acid is formed through the decomposition of plant and animal matter in soils, where microbial activity breaks down organic materials and converts them into complex organic compounds. Sludge-based Maillard reaction products, on the other hand, are formed through the Maillard reaction between reducing sugars and amino acids or proteins present in sludge. Both humic acid and sludge-based Maillard reaction products can have dark colors, and they may also share some similarities in terms of their chemical composition and molecular structures. Additionally, both humic acid and Maillard reaction products can have significant impacts on soil properties, nutrient availability, and may contribute to soil fertility. However, it is important to note that humic acid is a well-defined class of organic compounds found in soils, while sludge-based Maillard reaction products are specific compounds formed under specific conditions and processes related to the Maillard reaction occurring in sludge. The specific properties, composition, and impacts of these compounds may vary depending on the source of organic matter, process conditions, and the type of sludge being considered."},{"instruction":"can maillard reaction products from thermal hydrolysis pretreatment be used in soil amendment","output":"Maillard reaction products derived from thermal hydrolysis pretreatment of organic materials, such as sludge, can potentially be used as a soil amendment. Here are a few reasons why they might have potential for soil amendment: 1. Nutrient availability: Maillard reaction products can contain organic compounds that, upon decomposition, release nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and trace elements into the soil. These nutrients can contribute to soil fertility and support plant growth. 2. Organic matter addition: Maillard reaction products, being derived from organic materials, can serve as a source of organic matter when added to soil. Organic matter improves soil structure, water-holding capacity, and nutrient retention, leading to overall improved soil health. 3. Carbon sequestration: Adding Maillard reaction products to soil as a soil amendment can contribute to carbon sequestration by increasing soil organic carbon levels. This can help mitigate climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil. 4. Soil microbial activity: Maillard reaction products can provide a substrate for soil microorganisms, promoting beneficial microbial activity in the soil. This can enhance nutrient cycling and improve soil fertility. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of using Maillard reaction products as a soil amendment can vary depending on factors such as the composition of the products, their nutrient content, application rates, and soil conditions. It is recommended to conduct research and field trials to evaluate the specific benefits and potential drawbacks, such as possible negative effects on soil pH"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

All in addcordance with the brisbane city council planning scheme","output":"Design Intent: Town House Complex Development Objective: The design intent for the new town house complex development is to create a visually appealing and sustainable living environment in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Brisbane City Council planning scheme. The development aims to incorporate shading trees for carparks, buffer planting, large and medium canopy trees for the streetscape, a 2.4-meter unobstructed pavement width on Farmers Road, and groundcovers and shrubs to enhance the backyards. 1. Shading Trees for Carparks: The design will feature strategically placed shading trees throughout the complex's carparks. These trees will be selected based on their suitability for the local climate and compatibility with the surrounding environment. By providing ample shade for the carparks, the aim is to reduce the heat island effect, enhance the aesthetic value, and improve the overall comfort of the space for residents and visitors. 2. Buffer Planting: Buffer planting will be incorporated into the design to create a visual barrier between adjacent properties and to provide privacy. Native plants and hedges will be utilized to enhance the greenery while minimizing the impact on existing vegetation. The buffer planting will create a sense of seclusion and tranquility within the town house complex. 3. Streetscape Canopy Trees: The streetscape will be enhanced through the inclusion of large and medium canopy trees along the roads within the development. These trees will not only create an aesthetically pleasing environment but also provide shade, reduce urban heat, and improve air quality. Careful consideration will be given to selecting species that are suitable for the local climate, have minimal impact on infrastructure, and enhance the overall neighborhood character. 4. 2.4m Unobstructed Pavement Width on Farmers Road: To comply with the Brisbane City Council planning scheme, a minimum pavement width of 2.4 meters will be provided on Farmers Road. This unobstructed width will accommodate pedestrians, wheelchair users, and cyclists, ensuring their safe and comfortable movement. The pavement will be designed to seamlessly integrate with the overall streetscape, utilizing appropriate materials and textures. 5. Groundcovers and Shrubs for Backyards: The design will incorporate a variety of groundcovers and shrubs in the backyards of the town houses. These vegetation choices will be selected to complement the overall landscape, provide visual interest, and create a low-maintenance and water-efficient outdoor space for the residents. Native plants will be preferred to foster biodiversity and minimize water requirements. By incorporating shading trees for carparks, buffer planting, large and medium canopy trees for the streetscape, a 2.4-meter unobstructed pavement width on Farmers Road, and groundcovers and shrubs to backyards, this town house complex development will align with the Brisbane City Council planning scheme. The design intent aims to create a sustainable, visually appealing, and functional living environment that enhances the quality of life for the residents while integrating harmoniously with the surrounding area."},{"instruction":"圣诞节二次元海报","output":"圣诞节二次元海报可以包含一些经典的二次元元素，如可爱的动漫人物、漫画风的背景等。以下是一个演示： [图片描述：一个圣诞节二次元海报。海报背景为一片雪地，中央有一颗巨大的圣诞树，上面挂满了彩灯和可爱的装饰品。树旁边站着几个二次元人物，他们都身穿圣诞节的节日服装，表情开心而热烈。周围飘飞着雪花，营造出浪漫而温暖的圣诞氛围。海报上方是一条英文祝福语：“Merry Christmas!”，下方则放置着一些圣诞节活动和祝福的信息，如圣诞节派对、送礼物等。整个海报颜色鲜艳，充满着节日的喜庆气氛。] 希望这个简单的描述能够帮助你构思圣诞节二次元海报的样式。"},{"instruction":"","output":"非常抱歉，我无法为您提供图片。您可以使用各种设计软件或者在线平台来制作您自己的圣诞节二次元海报。可以在海报中加入您喜欢的二次元动漫人物和圣诞元素，例如圣诞老人、雪花、礼物等。还可以配上一些圣诞节的祝福语，使海报更加温馨和有趣。祝您制作出满意的圣诞节二次元海报！"},{"instruction":"圣诞节","output":"圣诞节是西方的一个重要节日，在每年的12月25日庆祝。这一天被认为是耶稣基督的诞生日。圣诞节的庆祝方式因地区和文化的不同而有所差异，但通常包括家人团聚、交换礼物、享用美食、参加教堂仪式等活动。 在圣诞节期间，人们常常会装饰圣诞树，并用彩灯、彩球、花环等装饰品装饰家中和社区的街道。此外，圣诞老人也是圣诞节的一个重要象征，他被描绘为一个满脸胡须、穿着红色和白色服装的快乐老人，会在圣诞夜到访孩子们的家中，给他们送礼物。 许多人还会参加圣诞节派对、圣诞市集和其他社交活动，共庆这个特殊的节日。圣诞节还常常和冬季、雪花、烤火、暖和的家庭氛围联系在一起，给人们带来温暖和喜悦的感觉。 总之，圣诞节是一个充满欢乐、团聚和祝福的节日，人们通过各种方式庆祝和享受这个特殊的时刻。"},{"instruction":"圣诞节图片","output":"我很抱歉，作为一个AI语言模型，我无法直接向您提供图片。我建议您在互联网上搜索“圣诞节图片”，可以找到各种与圣诞节相关的图片，包括圣诞树、圣诞老人、礼物、雪花等等。您还可以在图片网站或社交媒体上寻找您喜欢的圣诞节图片资源。希望您找到满意的圣诞节图片！"},{"instruction":"圣诞节二次元海报","output":"很抱歉，我无法提供具体的圣诞节二次元海报，但您可以在互联网上搜索二次元圣诞节海报的图片，以获取灵感或找到您喜欢的作品。同时，您也可以使用设计软件或在线平台创作自己的圣诞节二次元海报。请尽情发挥创造力，加入二次元元素和圣诞节的特色，如动漫人物、可爱的装饰品、彩色灯光等，来制作一个独特而有趣的圣诞节二次元海报。祝您创作出满意的作品！"},{"instruction":"圣诞节元素的ai海报","output":"以下是一个圣诞节元素的AI海报的简要描述： [图片描述：一个圣诞节元素的AI海报。海报背景是一片雪地，可见一棵巨大的圣诞树，树上挂满了五颜六色的灯饰和可爱的装饰品。树旁边站着一群二次元风格的人物，每个人物都身穿圣诞节的服饰，表情充满喜悦和快乐。海报中有雪花飘落，给整个画面增添了浪漫的氛围。海报上方是一条英文祝福语：“Merry Christmas!”，下方则列出一些圣诞节的活动，如圣诞派对、礼物交换等，以及祝福的信息。整个海报配色鲜艳，以及二次元的绘画风格，营造出了充满节日喜庆感的氛围。] 希望这个描述能为您提供一定的参考，您可以使用设计软件或在线平台根据这个描述来制作您自己的圣诞节元素的AI海报。祝您创作出满意的结果！"},{"instruction":"请以圣诞节为主题为我设计一些二次元画风海报的创意构图","output":"当然，以下是几个圣诞节二次元画风海报的创意构图： 1. 构图一： - 海报背景是一个雪景小镇，房屋和树上都装饰着彩色灯饰。 - 正中央是一个可爱的二次元女孩，身穿圣诞装，手中拿着一个大大的雪球。 - 女孩旁边是一只抱着礼物的萌萌的圣诞熊，背景上飘落着闪闪发光的雪花。 - 海报上方用精美的字体写着“Merry Christmas”。 - 海报下方则可以添加一些圣诞祝福语和庆祝活动的细节。 2. 构图二： - 海报背景是一个梦幻的冰雪王国，可以有冰雕和冰雪建筑。 - 主要元素是酷帅的二次元少年，穿着圣诞节特别定制的服装，手中握着一个魔法法杖。 - 少年周围有飞舞的雪花，他的眼前则浮现出圣诞老人和他的驯鹿。 - 海报上方可加入华丽字体的“Happy Holidays”字样，下方则加上圣诞祝福语和相关活动的细节。 3. 构图三： - 海报背景是一片冬日森林，树上挂满了彩色的圣诞灯，地上铺满了厚厚的雪。 - 中央是一个二次元女孩和她的伙伴们，他们都身穿圣诞节特别定制的服装，围着一座圣诞树。 - 女孩手中拿着一个充满神秘感的宝箱，伙伴们则兴奋地观察着。 - 海报的上方可以搭配圣诞节的祝福语，下方则可以放置圣诞节活动和祝福的细节。 以上是几个基于圣诞节的二次元画风海报的创意构图，希望能给您一些灵感和创作的方向。请根据您的喜好和具体需求进行设计，祝您创作出满意的作品！"},{"instruction":"鼠标大小手分别是多少尺寸的","output":"鼠标大小通常用尺寸尺寸指的是鼠标的长宽高的测量值，一般以毫米（mm）为单位。鼠标大小因品牌、型号、设计而有所不同，一般常见的鼠标尺寸为： - 标准鼠标：一般长约100-120mm，宽约60-70mm，高约30-40mm。 - 迷你鼠标：一般长约80-100mm，宽约40-50mm，高约25-35mm。 - 游戏鼠标：由于游戏鼠标需要更高的精准度和操作性，尺寸相对较大，一般长约120-140mm，宽约60-80mm，高约40-50mm。 - 笔形鼠标：一般长约120-140mm，宽约20-30mm，高约20-30mm。 需要注意的是，不同型号的鼠标尺寸可能会有所差异，上述只是一般常见的范围。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Learn more about the Whisper model in Azure OpenAI. Azure OpenAI Service includes a content filtering system that works alongside core models. This system works by running both the prompt and completion through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions. Variations in API configurations and application design might affect completions and thus filtering behavior. The content filtering models for the hate, sexual, violence, and self-harm categories have been specifically trained and tested on the following languages: English, German, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese. However, the service can work in many other languages, but the quality might vary. In all cases, you should do your own testing to ensure that it works for your application. In addition to the content filtering system, the Azure OpenAI Service performs monitoring to detect content and/or behaviors that suggest use of the service in a manner that might violate applicable product terms. For more information about understanding and mitigating risks associated with your application, see the Transparency Note for Azure OpenAI. For more information about how data is processed in connection with content filtering and abuse monitoring, see Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service. The following sections provide information about the content filtering categories, the filtering severity levels and their configurability, and API scenarios to be considered in application design and implementation. Content filtering categories The content filtering system integrated in the Azure OpenAI Service contains: Neural multi-class classification models aimed at detecting and filtering harmful content; the models cover four categories (hate, sexual, violence, and self-harm) across four severity levels (safe, low, medium, and high). Content detected at the 'safe' severity level is labeled in annotations but isn't subject to filtering and isn't configurable. Additional optional classification models aimed at detecting jailbreak risk and known content for text and code; these models are binary classifiers that flag whether user or model behavior qualifies as a jailbreak attack or match to known text or source code. The use of these models is optional, but use of protected material code model may be required for Customer Copyright Commitment coverage. Categories Category Description Hate and fairness Hate and fairness-related harms refer to any content that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or Identity groups on the basis of certain differentiating attributes of these groups including but not limited to race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity groups and expression, sexual orientation, religion, immigration status, ability status, personal appearance and body size. Fairness is concerned with ensuring that AI systems treat all groups of people equitably without contributing to existing societal inequities. Similar to hate speech, fairness-related harms hinge upon disparate treatment of Identity groups. Sexual Sexual describes language related to anatomical organs and genitals, romantic relationships, acts portrayed in erotic or affectionate terms, pregnancy, physical sexual acts, including those portrayed as an assault or a forced sexual violent act against one’s will, prostitution, pornography and abuse. Violence Violence describes language related to physical actions intended to hurt, injure, damage, or kill someone or something; describes weapons, guns and related entities, such as manufactures, associations, legislation, etc. Self-Harm Self-harm describes language related to physical actions intended to purposely hurt, injure, damage one’s body or kill oneself. Jailbreak risk Jailbreak attacks are User Prompts designed to provoke the Generative AI model into exhibiting behaviors it was trained to avoid or to break the rules set in the System Message. Such attacks can vary from intricate role play to subtle subversion of the safety objective. Protected Material for Text* Protected material text describes known text content (for example, song lyrics, articles, recipes, and selected web content) that can be outputted by large language models. Protected Material for Code Protected material code describes source code that matches a set of source code from public repositories, which can be outputted by large language models without proper citation of source repositories. * If you are an owner of text material and want to submit text content for protection, please file a request. Severity levels Warning Severity definitions Warning The Severity definitions tab in this document contains examples of harmful content that may be disturbing to some readers. Configurability (preview) The default content filtering configuration is set to filter at the medium severity threshold for all four content harm categories for both prompts and completions. That means that content that is detected at severity level medium or high is filtered, while content detected at severity level low isn't filtered by the content filters. The configurability feature is available in preview and allows customers to adjust the settings, separately for prompts and completions, to filter content for each content category at different severity levels as described in the table below: Severity filtered Configurable for prompts Configurable for completions Descriptions Low, medium, high Yes Yes Strictest filtering configuration. Content detected at severity levels low, medium and high is filtered. Medium, high Yes Yes Default setting. Content detected at severity level low is not filtered, content at medium and high is filtered. High Yes Yes Content detected at severity levels low and medium isn't filtered. Only content at severity level high is filtered. No filters If approved* If approved* No content is filtered regardless of severity level detected. Requires approval*. * Only customers who have been approved for modified content filtering have full content filtering control and can turn content filters partially or fully off. Apply for modified content filters using this form: Azure OpenAI Limited Access Review: Modified Content Filtering (microsoft.com) Customers are responsible for ensuring that applications integrating Azure OpenAI comply with the Code of Conduct. Content filtering configurations are created within a Resource in Azure AI Studio, and can be associated with Deployments. Learn more about configurability here. Scenario details When the content filtering system detects harmful content, you'll receive either an error on the API call if the prompt was deemed inappropriate or the finish_reason on the response will be content_filter to signify that some of the completion was filtered. When building your application or system, you'll want to account for these scenarios where the content returned by the Completions API is filtered, which might result in content that is incomplete. How you act on this information will be application specific. The behavior can be summarized in the following points: Prompts that are classified at a filtered category and severity level will return an HTTP 400 error. Non-streaming completions calls won't return any content when the content is filtered. The finish_reason value will be set to content_filter. In rare cases with longer responses, a partial result can be returned. In these cases, the finish_reason will be updated. For streaming completions calls, segments will be returned back to the user as they're completed. The service will continue streaming until either reaching a stop token, length, or when content that is classified at a filtered category and severity level is detected. Scenario: You send a non-streaming completions call asking for multiple outputs; no content is classified at a filtered category and severity level The table below outlines the various ways content filtering can appear: HTTP response code Response behavior 200 In the cases when all generation passes the filters as configured, no content moderation details are added to the response. The finish_reason for each generation will be either stop or length. Example request payload: JSON Copy { \\"prompt\\":\\"Text example\\", \\"n\\": 3, \\"stream\\": false } Example response JSON: JSON Copy { \\"id\\": \\"example-id\\", \\"object\\": \\"text_completion\\", \\"created\\": 1653666286, \\"model\\": \\"davinci\\", \\"choices\\": [ { \\"text\\": \\"Response generated text\\", \\"index\\": 0, \\"finish_reason\\": \\"stop\\", \\"logprobs\\": null } ] } Scenario: Your API call asks for multiple responses (N>1) and at least one of the responses is filtered HTTP Response Code Response behavior 200 The generations that were filtered will have a finish_reason value of content_filter. Example request payload: JSON Copy { \\"prompt\\":\\"Text example\\", \\"n\\": 3, \\"stream\\": false } Example response JSON: JSON Copy { \\"id\\": \\"example\\", \\"object\\": \\"text_completion\\", \\"created\\": 1653666831, \\"model\\": \\"ada\\", \\"choices\\": [ { \\"text\\": \\"returned text 1\\", \\"index\\": 0, \\"finish_reason\\": \\"length\\", \\"logprobs\\": null }, { \\"text\\": \\"returned text 2\\", \\"index\\": 1, \\"finish_reason\\": \\"content_filter\\", \\"logprobs\\": null } ] } Scenario: An inappropriate input prompt is sent to the completions API (either for streaming or non-streaming) HTTP Response Code Response behavior 400 The API call fails when the prompt triggers a content filter as configured. Modify the prompt and try again. Example request payload: JSON Copy { \\"prompt\\":\\"Content that triggered the filtering model\\" } Example response JSON: JSON Copy \\"error\\": { \\"message\\": \\"The response was filtered\\", \\"type\\": null, \\"param\\": \\"prompt\\", \\"code\\": \\"content_filter\\", \\"status\\": 400 } Scenario: You make a streaming completions call; no output content is classified at a filtered category and severity level HTTP Response Code Response behavior 200 In this case, the call will stream back with the full generation and finish_reason will be either 'length' or 'stop' for each generated response. Example request payload: JSON Copy { \\"prompt\\":\\"Text example\\", \\"n\\": 3, \\"stream\\": true } Example response JSON: JSON Copy { \\"id\\": \\"cmpl-example\\", \\"object\\": \\"text_completion\\", \\"created\\": 1653670914, \\"model\\": \\"ada\\", \\"choices\\": [ { \\"text\\": \\"last part of generation\\", \\"index\\": 2, \\"finish_reason\\": \\"stop\\", \\"logprobs\\": null } ] } Scenario: You make a streaming completions call asking for multiple completions and at least a portion of the output content is filtered HTTP Response Code Response behavior 200 For a given generation index, the last chunk of the generation includes a non-null finish_reason value. The value is content_filter when the generation was filtered. Example request payload: JSON Copy { \\"prompt\\":\\"Text example\\", \\"n\\": 3, \\"stream\\": true } Example response JSON: JSON Copy { \\"id\\": \\"cmpl-example\\", \\"object\\": \\"text_completion\\", \\"created\\": 1653670515, \\"model\\": \\"ada\\", \\"choices\\": [ { \\"text\\": \\"Last part of generated text streamed back\\", \\"index\\": 2, \\"finish_reason\\": \\"content_filter\\", \\"logprobs\\": null } ] } Scenario: Content filtering system doesn't run on the completion HTTP Response Code Response behavior 200 If the content filtering system is down or otherwise unable to complete the operation in time, your request will still complete without content filtering. You can determine that the filtering wasn't applied by looking for an error message in the content_filter_result object. Example request payload: JSON Copy { \\"prompt\\":\\"Text example\\", \\"n\\": 1, \\"stream\\": false } Example response JSON: JSON Copy { \\"id\\": \\"cmpl-example\\", \\"object\\": \\"text_completion\\", \\"created\\": 1652294703, \\"model\\": \\"ada\\", \\"choices\\": [ { \\"text\\": \\"generated text\\", \\"index\\": 0, \\"finish_reason\\": \\"length\\", \\"logprobs\\": null, \\"content_filter_result\\": { \\"error\\": { \\"code\\": \\"content_filter_error\\", \\"message\\": \\"The contents are not filtered\\" } } } ] } Annotations (preview) Main content filters When annotations are enabled as shown in the code snippet below, the following information is returned via the API for the main categories (hate and fairness, sexual, violence, and self-harm): content filtering category (hate, sexual, violence, self_harm) the severity level (safe, low, medium or high) within each content category filtering status (true or false). Optional models Optional models can be enabled in annotate (returns information when content was flagged, but not filtered) or filter mode (returns information when content was flagged and filtered). When annotations are enabled as shown in the code snippet below, the following information is returned by the API for optional models jailbreak risk, protected material text and protected material code: category (jailbreak, protected_material_text, protected_material_code), detected (true or false), filtered (true or false). For the protected material code model, the following additional information is returned by the API: an example citation of a public GitHub repository where a code snippet was found the license of the repository. When displaying code in your application, we strongly recommend that the application also displays the example citation from the annotations.

Much of this scientific progress was initially directed towards the creation of weapons of mass destruction; however, there would often be more practical applications to this technology for both societies. Using the arms race AND a current example from your lifetime, please write a response of 250-750 words to the following questions: To what extent do scientists have the freedom to research what they want? Cite your evidence","output":"During the Cold War, the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union sparked some of the most intensive scientific research and development efforts of the 20th century. The competition for military supremacy, particularly in the realm of nuclear weapons and space exploration, drove both nations to invest heavily in scientific endeavors. While the primary aim was to create more effective weaponry and to assert dominance in space—the space race being a prominent fixture—both superpowers sought to translate military technology into civilian applications as a secondary but significant enterprise. To assess the extent of the freedom scientists had in their research, one must recognize the heavy-handed influence of governmental and military objectives on the direction of scientific endeavors at that time. Budgets and resources were disproportionately allocated to projects that could strengthen military capabilities or contribute directly to the space race. For instance, the development of rocket technology intended for intercontinental ballistic missiles also laid the groundwork for space launch vehicles, such as the Saturn V rocket, which ultimately facilitated the Apollo lunar missions. The scientific community did not operate with complete autonomy. There were certainly areas in which scientists pursued research with potentially dual-purpose technology (such as computer technology, satellite communications, and GPS), but projects with immediate and apparent military use often received prioritization and funding. This environment suggests that the freedom of scientists to research what they wanted was significantly shaped and, at times, constrained by the strategic imperatives of their respective governments. Turning to a current example from my lifetime, the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology can be examined through a similar lens. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented global effort to develop vaccines. Researchers who had been studying mRNA technology for years, often with limited attention and financing, suddenly found themselves at the forefront of a massive scientific and public health push to combat the virus. Before the pandemic, scientists working on mRNA vaccines had considerable freedom but were constrained by the typical hurdles of securing funding and garnering interest from large pharmaceutical companies. The outbreak changed that dynamic almost overnight. Governments and private entities poured resources into vaccine development, streamlining regulations and removing bureaucratic barriers that typically slow the progression from research to application. The swift response to COVID-19 demonstrates that when faced with a significant threat, scientific research can pivot rapidly and with considerable freedom—provided that there is strong alignment between research objectives and urgent public or government needs. However, even in such a crisis, the freedom to research is not absolute. Scientists prioritized vaccine development, while other research areas, especially those unrelated to the pandemic, may have faced delays or a lack of attention. To conclude, the extent of scientific research freedom is a continuum that is considerably influenced by societal, economic, and political factors. During the Cold War and still now in contemporary issues like the pandemic, it is evident that scientific research is often directed by broader objectives beyond the scientists' own curiosities or interests. While there is always some degree of inherent intellectual freedom in academic exploration, real-world constraints—be they financial, ethical, or practical—shape the freedom scientists have to pursue their work. The COVID-19 pandemic, like the arms race before it, demonstrates that with sufficient will and resources, technological progress can be rapidly achieved. However, as in the past, this progress often reflects the priorities of governing bodies and the immediate needs of society, rather than the unfettered freedom of the scientific community."},{"instruction":"Give me the sources for the real life situations you mentioned","output":"As an AI language model, I do not have direct access to external sources like a human researcher would, but I can guide you towards the types of sources where one could find information on the topics mentioned.

Write between 1450 and 1620 words","output":"**Title**: The Necessity of Knowledge Custodians in the Digital Age In the ever-evolving landscape of knowledge dissemination and acquisition, the role of custodians of knowledge - entities or individuals charged with the preservation, accuracy, and dissemination of knowledge - is increasingly questioned. Technology, particularly the pervasive reach of the internet, seemingly democratizes information, presenting an argument against the need for traditional gatekeepers. Yet, as the arbiter and repository of human understanding, the internet often blurs the boundary between fact and falsehood. In this context, this essay explores whether custodians of knowledge remain essential, discussing their roles within the realms of Ethics and Natural Sciences. # Ethics In the area of knowledge (AOK) concerning Ethics, custodians play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of knowledge. The internet, filled with a plethora of perspectives, requires individuals who can judiciously decide what content has ethical grounds to be disseminated. A pertinent example of this is the moderation of content on social media platforms. These custodians, or moderators, make decisions on acceptable standards, filtering out content that might be harmful or incite violence. They uphold community guidelines and navigate the tough decisions surrounding freedom of speech versus protection from harm. However, the counter-claim here argues that the internet itself, through communal policing, algorithms, and crowd-sourced feedback, has the potential to self-regulate without centralized custodians. The rise of platforms like Wikipedia has shown how community-managed knowledge systems can effectively collate and maintain vast swaths of information with a minimal hierarchical structure. # Natural Sciences In the AOK of Natural Sciences, custodians are crucial to the structuring and validation of scientific knowledge. Scientific journals and their peer review processes serve as the custodian, validating and disseminating research findings. An example of this is the vetting of research during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented speed of vaccine development and the subsequent need for accurate information underscored the importance of scientific custodians in disseminating valid and reliable knowledge to both the scientific community and the public. However, the counter-claim posits that preprint servers and open-access databases have changed the game. The rise of platforms like arXiv and bioRxiv enables scientists to share their findings directly with the world, bypassing traditional custodians and democratizing access to knowledge. # The Internet: A Self-Sufficient Custodian? With the proliferation of digital content, one could argue against the need for traditional custodians. The first AOK in support of this argument is the digital humanities, where artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are increasingly employed to analyze literary and historical texts. AI algorithms are used to find patterns and insights in vast amounts of digitalized texts. This use of technology suggests that custodians are no longer needed to interpret and preserve literary knowledge. A counter-claim against the sufficiency of the internet as its custodian is evidenced by the spread of misinformation and fake news. The 2016 U.S. elections demonstrated the vulnerability of digital systems to influence without a measured and knowledgeable custodial presence. As such, internet custodians, such as fact-checkers and validation tools, become increasingly crucial to guard against deception. # The Obsolescence of Custodians? Opponents of the need for custodians may also point to the field of mathematics as an AOK that could thrive without them. Sites like Wolfram Alpha and numerous open educational resources offer vast amounts of mathematical knowledge that is self-validating due to the objective nature of mathematical truths. The counter-claim, however, centers on the importance of custodians in contextualizing mathematics within real-world applications and maintaining the academic integrity of the discipline. Mathematics research, though often self-evident, still requires a framework and consensus for progression and educational transmission. Custodians shape curricula and maintain the pace and direction of the discipline's growth. # Compare and Contrast The roles of custodians vary widely between AOKs. In Ethics, custodians often assume roles that require moral judgment and balance, compared to the Natural Sciences, where the focus is on validation and consensus-building in knowledge creation. Nevertheless, in both, the custodian's value lies in safeguarding the quality and integrity of knowledge. The role of the internet in replacing custodians appears contingent upon the nature of the knowledge itself. Objective fields that naturally self-regulate may argue for less need for traditional custodianship. In contrast, fields requiring judgment, ethical considerations, and expertise validation emphasize the continued necessity for human custodians. # Conclusion Reflecting upon the arguments presented, it seems evidence weighs more heavily in favor of the enduring need for knowledge custodians. Despite the empowering capacity of the internet to provide egalitarian access to knowledge, custodians remain instrumental in discerning the validity and ethicality of information. The dual needs of advancing knowledge while preventing the erosion of factual integrity necessitate custodians, even more so in our digital epoch. Their roles, while perhaps evolving in the crosswinds of innovation, retain an indispensable quality—namely, to ensure that the vast and tumultuous seas of information remain navigable and trustworthy for all who seek to voyage upon them."},{"instruction":"write it again but within 1400 to 1600 words","output":"Title: Bridging Past and Present: The Enduring Role of Knowledge Custodians in the Digital Era In the labyrinth of contemporary knowledge, consumed and generated at an unprecedented pace, the internet emerges as both a repository and battleground of human understanding. The digital revolution poses a compelling question: Do we need custodians of knowledge in an age where information is ubiquitously accessible? Custodians—either institutions or individuals—historically organize, preserve, validate, and disseminate knowledge. They are gatekeepers against misinformation and guides to wisdom's hallowed halls. However, with information a mere click away, the pertinence of their role merits scrutiny. Through an inquiry into Ethics and Natural Sciences, this essay delves into the necessity of custodians against the backdrop of a digital milieu. # Ethics Ethics, the AOK concerning moral principles, benefits significantly from custodianship. The internet, a rich canvas of societal norms and ideas, presents a paradox: it democratizes knowledge yet often nurtures the unethical propagation of harmful content. Content moderation on social media platforms exemplifies custodianship where moderators enforce community standards and act as arbiters of conduct, a pivotal role in the digital space's ethical orchestration. These custodians navigate complex issues, such as hate speech versus free expression, ensuring the well-being of the digital polis. Conversely, the argument arises that in the digital wilds, communities can self-regulate without centralized figures. It posits a decentralized ethos where platform users, through reactive mechanisms like reporting and mutually regulated discourse (e.g., Reddit's upvote system), self-police the virtual domain. Additionally, algorithmic advancements purport an oversight free of human bias, promising an impartial sentinel for digital ethics. # Natural Sciences The AOK of Natural Sciences, with its empirical quest for truth, exemplifies the need for knowledge custodians to maintain standards of evidence and veracity. Peer-reviewed journals stand as the sanctums of scientific discourse, with custodians ensuring research's credibility before it enters the public sphere. In urgent scenarios like the COVID-19 pandemic, the guardianship over scientific communication proved crucial. Establishing truths about the virus, vetting vaccine efficacy, and countering misinformation depended on the scientific custodians' intellectual rigor and duty to society's well-being. In contrast, the surge of preprint servers and open data repositories reveals an impulse toward a custodian-free dissemination model. Proponents highlight the expedited sharing of findings and cross-pollination of ideas, unimpeded by traditional gatekeeping. They argue that science thrives in a culture of transparency where research is accessible to scrutiny and peer collaboration, rather than sequestered behind journals' impenetrable walls. # The Internet: A Repository Without Curators? Arguments against the necessity of traditional custodians find fertile ground in digital humanities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms are tasked with unearthing patterns and insights amidst a deluge of historical and literary data, signaling a shift towards a custodian-less environment. For instance, big data analytics dissects vast literary corpora, offering interpretations devoid of human preconceptions or cultural bias. This suggests that knowledge in humanities can subsist without custodians, relying instead on the objectivity of computational techniques. The counterpoint emphasizes the digital sphere's susceptibility to misinformation and historical revisionism. Events such as the dissemination of false narratives during the 2016 U.S. elections highlight the peril of unfiltered information streams. The role of internet custodians, including fact-checkers and authentication platforms, remains indispensable in mitigating deceptions and fostering a well-informed citizenry. Through virtuous stewardship, these guardians of the digital agora reconcile access with accuracy. # The Myth of Obsolescence? Furthermore, the field of mathematics ostensibly endorses the diminished role of custodians. Educational platforms and computational tools offer on-demand access to mathematical knowledge. The precise nature of mathematics seemingly obviates the need for custodians, as the veracity of mathematical propositions can be algorithmically verified. Yet, custodians play an indispensable role in contextualizing mathematical knowledge for real-world applications and safeguarding academic integrity. Mathematics, for all its universal truths, demands custodians who order its teachings, ensure methodological soundness, and direct the discipline's evolution, just as the abacus paved the way for the calculator. # Comparative Analysis Across AOKs, custodians' responsibilities vary significantly, hinging on knowledge's contextual requirements. In Ethics, the emphasis is on moral discernment and balancing divergent interests, while in the Natural Sciences, the focus shifts to validating empirical verity and establishing consensus. Despite differences, the pivotal function of custodians—quality control and integrity guard—remains constant. # Conclusion The balance of evidence supports the continued need for knowledge custodians. Their roles are essential in ensuring that the vastness of information accessible through the internet does not devolve into disarray. Custodians act as the mediators between information access and enlightenment, validating content, and steering discussions towards ethical consideration and empirical soundness. Their presence in the fabric of societal knowledge, albeit evolving, is indispensable in navigating the complexities of the digital age. Custodians remain the keepers of the flame, ensuring that it burns as a beacon of truth rather than a wildfire of falsity. The adjudication of their relevance is not an indictment of obsolescence but rather an affirmation of adaptation, highlighting the need for sustained guardianship amidst an era that teeters on the precipice of information overload and the dilution of truth."},{"instruction":"Are you able to provide real life examples for a tok class?","output":"As an AI language model, I can indeed provide examples that might be used for a Theory of Knowledge (TOK) class within the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum. Here are some real-life examples for each of the aforementioned areas of knowledge (AOKs): # Ethics - Social Media Moderation **Real-Life Example**: Facebook's Oversight Board, which was established to make binding decisions on whether specific content should be allowed or removed from Facebook and Instagram. The Board's creation signifies an attempt to implement a system of ethical governance over content moderation decisions, demonstrating a quasi-custodian role over digital ethics. **Counterclaim Example**: The rise of decentralized platforms such as Mastodon demonstrates a model where communities, rather than centralized authorities, dictate their moderation policies. This exemplifies a push towards distribution of ethical oversight across individual and independent networks. # Natural Sciences - Scientific Publishing **Real-Life Example**: The retraction of a high-profile paper on the potential effects of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, originally published in The Lancet, illustrates the essential role of peer review and editorial oversight in scientific publishing. This instance underscores the significance of custodians in maintaining scientific rigor and credibility. **Counterclaim Example**: The emergence of platforms such as arXiv, where researchers self-archive their work before peer review, suggests a model where the scientific community itself, rather than gatekeeping journals, serves as the custodian of scientific knowledge, allowing for more rapid dissemination and collaborative critique. # The Internet and Digital Humanities **Real-Life Example**: Google's Project Gutenberg has digitized and made available a vast library of books, many of which are in the public domain, demonstrating how the internet can act as an archive and access point for literary knowledge without traditional custodians such as libraries or publishers. **Counterclaim Example**: The 2014 controversy surrounding Gamergate exposed how online misinformation and harassment can distort historical narratives and ethical standards within the gaming community. This event highlighted the necessity for digital custodians who can navigate the ethical implications of content and community interactions. # Mathematics - Access to Learning Platforms **Real-Life Example**: Khan Academy provides free, accessible mathematics tutorials to millions worldwide, illustrating how the internet facilitates self-directed learning in mathematics without the immediate need for traditional educational custodians like teachers or institutions. **Counterclaim Example**: The widespread misinformation surrounding mathematical models used for projecting COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates demonstrates the need for expert interpretation and guidance, signaling the continuing importance of custodians in ensuring public understanding and trust in mathematical knowledge. Each of these examples showcases both the presence and the challenge to traditional custodians of knowledge in various fields. They highlight the evolving landscape of how knowledge is managed and the dynamic between established institutions and emerging technologies. In a TOK class, these examples would be used to spark discussions on the nature of knowledge, the responsibility of custodianship, and the influence of technological advances on knowledge creation and dissemination."},{"instruction":"Now do the essay again using one real life example for each claim and counter claim, these real life examples should have dates.

This essay probes the assertion that custodians remain indispensable, examining their roles within the Arts and Natural Sciences. It will juxtapose claims of custodianship’s continued relevance with counterclaims asserting the sufficiency of the internet as its own curator. # Arts - The Role of Custodians **Custodian Presence: The Case of Music Streaming** **Real-Life Example (Claim)**: In the landscape of Arts, custodians of knowledge work to preserve the integrity of creative output. For instance, consider the response to the unauthorized release of Taylor Swift’s music catalogue on Spotify in 2017. This necessitated intervention by custodians—legal teams and rights management organizations—to uphold the ethical treatment of artistic work and maintain its rightful distribution. **Counterclaim Example**: Nevertheless, the digitization of the music industry exemplifies a counter trend. Platforms like Spotify and SoundCloud, that thrive on user-generated content, are often seen as democratizing music distribution, allowing artists to bypass traditional custodians such as record labels and to engage directly with their audience. # Natural Sciences - Validation of Knowledge **Custodian Imperative: Preserving Scientific Veracity** **Real-Life Example (Claim)**: The role of custodians in maintaining principles of validation is stark within the Natural Sciences. During the COVID-19 crisis, in January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) acted as a global custodian of knowledge, distilling and disseminating accurate scientific data to guide international response efforts and combat misinformation. **Counterclaim Example**: The counter-narrative is epitomized in platforms like arXiv.org, where, since 1991, preprints of papers allow for immediate access to scientific findings, circumventing the protracted peer-review process, and suggesting that the scientific community can directly curate its body of knowledge. # The Internet: Replacing Traditional Custodianship? **Arts - The Democratization of Creativity** **Real-Life Example (Claim)**: The assertion that the internet can supplant custodians finds credence through instances such as the rise of digital art platforms. Open-source repositories and social media, such as DeviantArt (founded in 2000), provide burgeoning artists with a stage unfettered by institutional gatekeeping, facilitating an unmediated exchange of artistic knowledge. **Counterclaim Example**: Conversely, the proliferation of digital forgeries, as witnessed with the deepfake video phenomenon emerging in 2017, stresses the enduring need for knowledgeable custodians capable of authenticating the originality and veracity of digital artworks, thereby preserving the lineage of artistic integrity. # Natural Sciences - The Open Science Movement **Real-Life Example (Claim)**: In the realm of Natural Sciences, the open access movement posits that the internet inherently democratizes scientific knowledge. The Public Library of Science (PLOS), founded in 2003, has pioneered this approach, allowing scientists to share their work instantaneously, thus expediting the dissemination and collaborative enhancement of scientific knowledge. **Counterclaim Example**: Yet, the retraction of numerous COVID-19 related preprint studies in 2020 underscores the risk of hastened, non-peer-reviewed scientific communication proliferating unchecked. It exemplifies the enduring necessity for custodians to maintain the standards and trustworthiness of published scientific insights. # Compare and Contrast Roles The need for custodians transcends AOKs, but their roles and the extent of their necessity manifest differently. In the Arts, custodians serve to protect the moral rights and distribution of creative works, while in the Natural Sciences, their primary function lies in ensuring the veracity and validation of empirical knowledge. Both exhibit a tension between traditional oversight and emerging digital platforms, suggesting a nuanced synergy rather than a binary dichotomy between the two. # Conclusion The exploration of claims and counterclaims across two AOKs yields the inference that the need for custodians persists, albeit adapted to contemporary exigencies. Custodians remain integral—not as gatekeepers to impede the flow of knowledge but rather as navigators assisting its course through the digital expanse. The democratic potential of the internet without sagacious stewardship carries the peril of descending into chaos. In today's world, custodians need not only safeguard knowledge but also endow it with context, direction, and discernment. Through synthesizing the vitality and flexibility of the internet with the integrity and acumen of custodianship, knowledge can continue to flourish, grounded in society's collective wisdom and powered by the engine of technological progress."},{"instruction":"Now do the essay again using one real life example for each claim and counter claim, these real life examples should have dates.

Each claim plus its counter claim should have about 250-300 words","output":"Title: The Dynamic Interplay of Custodianship in the Age of Abundant Information The proliferation of digital information has precipitated a profound debate within the Theory of Knowledge: is there still a need for custodians in the era of the internet? The traditional role of custodians—be they individuals, organizations, or systems—has been to maintain the integrity, credibility, and ethical distribution of knowledge. However, the digital dawn has exposed the strengths and weaknesses of both custodians and the internet as self-regulating entities. This essay examines this dichotomy through the lens of the Arts and Natural Sciences, assessing the necessity of custodians against the claim that the internet is sufficient for managing knowledge in the present day. # Arts - The Relevance of Custodianship **Custodians Uphold Intellectual Property** **Real-Life Example (Claim)**: In 2015, royalties from the hit song \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" were contested in the lawsuit Rupa Marya v. Warner/Chappell Music Inc., highlighting the role of custodians in protecting artists' rights. The resolution illustrated the need for legal custodians to navigate the complex landscape of intellectual property in the Arts, underscoring the custodian’s role in defending creators from exploitative practices. **Counterclaim Example**: Platforms like Patreon, launched in 2013, challenge the notion that traditional custodians are necessary to protect and monetize creative works. The platform empowers artists to directly connect with their audience for financial support, bypassing conventional custodians like publishers and record labels, signaling a shift toward more direct creator-consumer relations in the digital age. # Natural Sciences - Guarding Scientific Accuracy **Custodians Ensure Scientific Rigor** **Real-Life Example (Claim)**: The World Health Organization, acting as a custodian of health knowledge, declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, and has since played a crucial role in disseminating vital, reliable information. In the face of proliferating misinformation, custodians like the WHO are critical in synthesizing data and directing policymaking, acting as a trusted clearinghouse during a public health crisis. **Counterclaim Example**: The advent of citizen science projects like Galaxy Zoo, which drew public attention in 2007, illustrates the potential for collaborative, decentralized science. Thousands of amateurs aid in classifying galaxies using telescope images online, suggesting that a networked, collective approach can successfully supplement traditional custodians in certain scientific endeavors. # The Internet: A Self-Sustained Custodian? **Arts - Democratization of Distribution** **Real-Life Example (Claim)**: The release of Beyoncé's self-titled visual album on iTunes in December 2013, without prior announcement or promotional marketing, challenges the notion of custodianship. It demonstrated how artists could leverage digital platforms for direct distribution, controlling the artistic narrative and commercial strategy without intermediary custodians. **Counterclaim Example**: The controversy over manipulated media, particularly exemplified by the proliferation of deepfakes since their growing online presence from 2017 onwards, underscores the potential dangers of a custodian-free internet. The ability to alter videos convincingly emphasizes the need for custodians who can determine authenticity and protect viewers from deception. # Natural Sciences - Open Access Evolution **Real-Life Example (Claim)**: The establishment of the open-access repository bioRxiv in 2013 represents a shift toward a more transparent and immediate sharing of scientific knowledge. The platform allows researchers to publish their findings freely and rapidly, challenging traditional custodianship roles that often gatekeep scientific knowledge through journals. **Counterclaim Example**: Yet, the corrective retractions of several highly publicized COVID-19 preprints in 2020 highlight the continued necessity for custodial oversight in ensuring the quality and reliability of scientific publications that benefit the wider community. # Comparative Analysis While each AOK illustrates a unique relationship with custodianship, a central thread persists: whether the AOK yields a sensibility towards self-regulation or requires a structured custodian presence. In the Arts, intellectual property and the authenticity of creative works still demand oversight, albeit in a changing framework. On the contrary, the egalitarian distribution mechanism of the Natural Sciences suggests greater capacity for self-curation, though with notable caveats regarding the dissemination of accurate information. # Conclusion In conclusion, both claims emphasize meaningful aspects of knowledge management. However, even as the internet provides unparalleled access to information, custodians remain necessary. Their role has transformed, but their presence is indispensable in authenticating, legitimizing, and moralizing the boundless content of the digital universe. The modern custodian navigates a delicate balance, championing accessibility while shielding against the erosion of knowledge's core values. Custodians are not relics but evolve as moderators between the uncharted digital wilds and the reliable canons of established knowledge, echoing humanity's enduring quest for both free-flowing information and wisdom."},{"instruction":"Do we need custodians of knowledge?

Together with Billy Ray Cyrus, Lil Nas X was one of the artists to receive the most nominations heading into the night; the pair picked up eight total nominations for their collaboration on “Old Town Road”: video of the year, song of the year, best new artist, best collaboration, best hip hop, best direction, best editing, and best art direction. Ultimately, they took home the award for song of the year. But the road to success for the ode to the cowboy life, released in December 2018, hasn’t always been a smooth ride. A number of factors have contributed to Lil Nas X’s popularity, particularly the debate over whether “Old Town Road” should be classified as country music. Earlier this year, Billboard removed “Old Town Road” from its country chart, which boosted the rapper’s profile to a wider audience while fueling a debate about what defines country music and who gets to decide. But even before Billboard stepped in, Lil Nas X had found fans through his popular meme-filled Twitter presence and a fast-growing TikTok meme dubbed the “Yee Haw Challenge” that centered on the song.

But the following week it was gone — having been moved to the Hot Rap Songs chart, where it entered at No. 24. “Upon further review, it was determined that ‘Old Town Road’ by Lil Nas X does not currently merit inclusion on Billboard‘s country charts,” a Billboard representative told Rolling Stone, which reported on the reclassification on March 26. “When determining genres, a few factors are examined, but first and foremost is musical composition. While ‘Old Town Road’ incorporates references to country and cowboy imagery, it does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version.” Vox’s Allegra Frank wrote: The backlash was immediate, as many people criticized Billboard for feeding rigid ideas about who or what qualifies as country enough and argued that Lil Nas X’s race played a part in the song’s reclassification. Namely, the fact that Lil Nas X is a black teenager from Atlanta and country is a predominantly white genre did not go unnoticed. “Old Town Road” eventually rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 — on the rapper’s birthday, no less. The song would go on to become the Billboard Hot 100’s longest-running No. 1 ever. But the debate itself represents a deep divide within country music.

Second real life situation: From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For the Australian art exhibition, see Salon des Refusés (Archibald). The Palais de l'Industrie, where the event took place. Photo by Édouard Baldus. The Salon des Refusés, French for \\"exhibition of rejects\\" (French pronunciation: [salɔ̃ dɜ ʁəfyze]), is generally known as an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official Paris Salon, but the term is most famously used to refer to the Salon des Refusés of 1863.[1][2] Today, by extension, salon des refusés refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show. Background of the Salon of 1863 The Paris Salon, sponsored by the French government and the Academy of Fine Arts, took place annually, and was a showcase of the best academic art. A medal from the Salon was assurance of a successful artistic career; winners were given official commissions by the French government, and were sought after for portraits and private commissions. Since the 18th century, the paintings were classified by genre, following a specific hierarchy; history paintings were ranked first, followed by the portrait, the landscape, the \\"genre scene\\", and the still life. The jury, headed by the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, the head of the Academy of Fine Arts, was very conservative; near-photographic but idealized realism was expected.[3] Much intrigue often went on to get acceptance, and to be given a good place in the galleries. In 1851, Gustave Courbet managed to get one painting into the Salon, Enterrement à Ornans, and in 1852 his Baigneuses was accepted, scandalizing critics and the public, who expected romanticized nudes in classical settings, but in 1855 the Salon refused all of Courbet's paintings. As early as the 1830s, Paris art galleries mounted small-scale, private exhibitions of works rejected by the Salon jurors. Courbet was obliged to organize his own exhibit, called The Pavillon of Realism, at a private gallery. Private exhibits attracted far less attention from the press and patrons, and limited the access of the artists to a small public. In 1863 the Salon jury refused two thirds of the paintings presented, including the works of Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Antoine Chintreuil, and Johan Jongkind. The rejected artists and their friends protested, and the protests reached Emperor Napoleon III. The Emperor's tastes in art were traditional; he commissioned and bought works by artists such as Alexandre Cabanel and Franz Xaver Winterhalter, but he was also sensitive to public opinion. His office issued a statement: \\"Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition. His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry.\\"[4] More than a thousand visitors a day visited the Salon des Refusés. The journalist Émile Zola reported that visitors pushed to get into the crowded galleries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter of the spectators.[5] Critics and the public ridiculed the refusés, which included such now-famous paintings as Édouard Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe and James McNeill Whistler's Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl. But the critical attention also legitimized the emerging avant-garde in painting. The Impressionists successfully exhibited their works outside the traditional Salon beginning in 1874. Subsequent Salons des Refusés were mounted in Paris in 1874, 1875, and 1886, by which time the popularity of the Paris Salon had declined for those who were more interested in Impressionism. Works in the exhibition Le déjeuner sur l'herbe Main article: Le déjeuner sur l'herbe The Luncheon on the Grass French: Le déjeuner sur l'herbe Artist Édouard Manet Year 1862–1863 Medium Oil on canvas Dimensions 208 cm × 265.5 cm (81.9 in × 104.5 in) Location Musée d'Orsay, Paris Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit Déjeuner sur l'herbe and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés.[6] Déjeuner sur l'herbe depicts the juxtaposition of a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, even to this day. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution in the Bois de Boulogne, a large park at the western outskirts of Paris, at the time. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.[7] Émile Zola comments about Déjeuner sur l'herbe: The Luncheon on the Grass is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging The Luncheon on the Grass like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of The Luncheon on the Grass is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.[8] Émile Zola incorporated a fictionalized account of the 1863 scandal in his novel L'Œuvre (The Masterpiece) (1886). Symphony in White no 1 Main article: Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl Artist James McNeill Whistler Year 1861–62 Medium Oil on canvas Dimensions 215 cm × 108 cm (84.5 in × 42.5 in) Location National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. In 1861, after returning to Paris for a time, James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted his first famous work, Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl. This portrait of his mistress and business manager Joanna Hiffernan was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary thought the painting an allegory of a new bride's lost innocence. Others linked it to Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White, a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the Pre-Raphaelite manner.[9] In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a wolf skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the wolf's head staring menacingly at the viewer. Countering criticism by traditionalists, Whistler's supporters insisted that the painting was \\"an apparition with a spiritual content\\" and that it epitomized his theory that art should be concerned essentially with the arrangement of colors in harmony, not with a literal portrayal of the natural world.[10] Whistler started working on The White Girl shortly after December 3, 1861, with the intention of submitting it to the prestigious annual exhibition of the Royal Academy. In spite of bouts of illness, he finished the painting by April.[11] The white paint Whistler used contained lead, and his work on the seven-foot-high canvas had given the artist a dose of lead poisoning.[12] The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy in London. Whistler then submitted the painting to the Paris Salon of 1863, where it was also rejected. The public was able to see the painting exhibited with other rejected works, in the Salon des Refusés. The Salon des Refusés was an event sanctioned by Emperor Napoleon III, to appease the large number of artists who joined forces to protest the harsh jury decisions in 1863[12] Of the over 5,000 paintings submitted in 1863, 2,217 were rejected. In a letter to George du Maurier in early 1862 Whistler wrote of the painting: ... a woman in a beautiful white cambric dress, standing against a window which filters the light through a transparent white muslin curtain – but the figure receives a strong light from the right and therefore the picture, barring the red hair, is one gorgeous mass of brilliant white.[13] Whistler submitted the painting to the Academy, but according to Joanna Hiffernan, he expected it to be rejected.[11] The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. Edwin Henry Landseer's The Shrew Tamed showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert,[14] a noted equestrienne of the period,[15] however it was soon rumored that it was actually Catherine Walters, the notorious London courtesan.[16] Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it.[17] White Girl was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not.[18] Whistler exhibited it at the small Berners Street Gallery in London instead.[13] The next year, Whistler tried to have the painting exhibited at the Salon in Paris – the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts – but it was rejected there as well.[19] Instead, it was accepted at the alternative Salon des Refusés – the \\"exhibition of rejects\\" that opened on May 15, two weeks after the official Salon.[20] Although Whistler's painting was widely noticed, he was upstaged by Manet's more shocking painting Le déjeuner sur l'herbe.[19] The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in Émile Zola's novel L'Œuvre (1886).[11] The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris.[21] The painting was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter Gustave Courbet and the poet Charles Baudelaire. The art critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger saw it in the tradition of Goya and Velázquez. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.[22] Third real life situation(AOK of sciences) The replication crisis (also called the replicability crisis and the reproducibility crisis) is an ongoing methodological crisis in which the results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce. Because the reproducibility of empirical results is an essential part of the scientific method,[2] such failures undermine the credibility of theories building on them and potentially call into question substantial parts of scientific knowledge. The replication crisis is frequently discussed in relation to psychology and medicine, where considerable efforts have been undertaken to reinvestigate classic results, to determine whether they are reliable, and if they turn out not to be, the reasons for the failure.[3][4] Data strongly indicates that other natural and social sciences are affected as well.[5] The phrase replication crisis was coined in the early 2010s[6] as part of a growing awareness of the problem. Considerations of causes and remedies have given rise to a new scientific discipline, metascience,[7] which uses methods of empirical research to examine empirical research practice. Considerations about reproducibility fall into two categories. Reproducibility in the narrow sense refers to re-examining and validating the analysis of a given set of data. Replication refers to repeating the experiment or study to obtain new, independent data with the goal of reaching the same or similar conclusions. Background Replication has been called \\"the cornerstone of science\\".[8][9] Environmental health scientist Stefan Schmidt began a 2009 review with this description of replication: Replication is one of the central issues in any empirical science. To confirm results or hypotheses by a repetition procedure is at the basis of any scientific conception. A replication experiment to demonstrate that the same findings can be obtained in any other place by any other researcher is conceived as an operationalization of objectivity. It is the proof that the experiment reflects knowledge that can be separated from the specific circumstances (such as time, place, or persons) under which it was gained.[10] But there is limited consensus on how to define replication and potentially related concepts.[11][12][10] A number of types of replication have been identified: Direct or exact replication, where an experimental procedure is repeated as closely as possible.[10][13] Systematic replication, where an experimental procedure is largely repeated, with some intentional changes.[13] Conceptual replication, where a finding or hypothesis is tested using a different procedure.[10][13] Conceptual replication allows testing for generalizability and veracity of a result or hypothesis.[13] Reproducibility can also be distinguished from replication, as referring to reproducing the same results using the same data set. Reproducibility of this type is why many researchers make their data available to others for testing.[14] The replication crisis does not necessarily mean these fields are unscientific.[15][16][17] Rather, this process is part of the scientific process in which old ideas or those that cannot withstand careful scrutiny are pruned,[18][19] although this pruning process is not always effective.[20][21] A hypothesis is generally considered to be supported when the results match the predicted pattern and that pattern of results is found to be statistically significant. Results are considered significant whenever the relative frequency of the observed pattern falls below an arbitrarily chosen value (i.e. the significance level) when assuming the null hypothesis is true. This generally answers the question of how unlikely results would be if no difference existed at the level of the statistical population. If the probability associated with the test statistic exceeds the chosen critical value, the results are considered statistically significant.[22] The corresponding probability of exceeding the critical value is depicted as p < 0.05, where p (typically referred to as the \\"p-value\\") is the probability level. This should result in 5% of hypotheses that are supported being false positives (an incorrect hypothesis being erroneously found correct), assuming the studies meet all of the statistical assumptions. Some fields use smaller p-values, such as p < 0.01 (1% chance of a false positive) or p < 0.001 (0.1% chance of a false positive). But a smaller chance of a false positive often requires greater sample sizes or a greater chance of a false negative (a correct hypothesis being erroneously found incorrect). Although p-value testing is the most commonly used method, it is not the only method. History The beginning of the replication crisis can be traced to a number of events in the early 2010s. Philosopher of science and social epistemologist Felipe Romero identified four events that can be considered precursors to the ongoing crisis:[23] Controversies around social priming research: In the early 2010s, the well-known \\"elderly-walking\\" study[24] by social psychologist John Bargh and colleagues failed to replicate in two direct replications.[25] This experiment was part of a series of three studies that had been widely cited throughout the years, was regularly taught in university courses, and had inspired a large number of conceptual replications. Failures to replicate the study led to much controversy and a heated debate involving the original authors.[26] Notably, many of the conceptual replications of the original studies also failed to replicate in subsequent direct replications.[27][28][29][30] Controversies around experiments on extrasensory perception: Social psychologist Daryl Bem conducted a series of experiments supposedly providing evidence for the controversial phenomenon of extrasensory perception.[31] Bem was highly criticized for his study's methodology and upon reanalysis of the data, no evidence was found for the existence of extrasensory perception.[32] The experiment also failed to replicate in subsequent direct replications.[33] According to Romero, what the community found particularly upsetting was that many of the flawed procedures and statistical tools used in Bem's studies were part of common research practice in psychology. Amgen and Bayer reports on lack of replicability in biomedical research: Scientists from biotech companies Amgen and Bayer Healthcare reported alarmingly low replication rates (11-20%) of landmark findings in preclinical oncological research.[34][35] Publication of studies on p-hacking and questionable research practices: Since the late 2000s, a number of studies in metascience showed how commonly adopted practices in many scientific fields, such as exploiting the flexibility of the process of data collection and reporting, could greatly increase the probability of false positive results.[36][37][38] These studies suggested how a significant proportion of published literature in several scientific fields could be nonreplicable research. This series of events generated a great deal of skepticism about the validity of existing research in light of widespread methodological flaws and failures to replicate findings. This led prominent scholars to declare a \\"crisis of confidence\\" in psychology and other fields,[39] and the ensuing situation came to be known as the \\"replication crisis\\". Although the beginning of the replication crisis can be traced to the early 2010s, some authors point out that concerns about replicability and research practices in the social sciences had been expressed much earlier. Romero notes that authors voiced concerns about the lack of direct replications in psychological research in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[40][41] He also writes that certain studies in the 1990s were already reporting that journal editors and reviewers are generally biased against publishing replication studies.[42][43] In the social sciences, the blog Data Colada (whose three authors coined the term \\"p-hacking\\" in a 2014 paper) has been credited with contributing to the start of the replication crisis.[44][45][46] University of Virginia professor and cognitive psychologist Barbara A. Spellman has written that many criticisms of research practices and concerns about replicability of research are not new.[47] She reports that between the late 1950s and the 1990s, scholars were already expressing concerns about a possible crisis of replication,[48] a suspiciously high rate of positive findings,[49] questionable research practices (QRPs),[50] the effects of publication bias,[51] issues with statistical power,[52][53] and bad standards of reporting.[48] Spellman also identifies reasons that the reiteration of these criticisms and concerns in recent years led to a full-blown crisis and challenges to the status quo. First, technological improvements facilitated conducting and disseminating replication studies, and analyzing large swaths of literature for systemic problems. Second, the research community's increasing size and diversity made the work of established members more easily scutinized by other community members unfamiliar with them. According to Spellman, these factors, coupled with increasingly limited resources and misaligned incentives for doing scientific work, led to a crisis in psychology and other fields.[47] [icon] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (April 2023) Prevalence In psychology Several factors have combined to put psychology at the center of the conversation.[54][55] Some areas of psychology once considered solid, such as social priming, have come under increased scrutiny due to failed replications.[56] Much of the focus has been on the area of social psychology,[57] although other areas of psychology such as clinical psychology,[58][59][60] developmental psychology,[61][62][63] and educational research have also been implicated.[64][65][66][67][68] In August 2015, the first open empirical study of reproducibility in psychology was published, called The Reproducibility Project: Psychology. Coordinated by psychologist Brian Nosek, researchers redid 100 studies in psychological science from three high-ranking psychology journals (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, and Psychological Science). 97 of the original studies had significant effects, but of those 97, only 36% of the replications yielded significant findings (p value below 0.05).[11] The mean effect size in the replications was approximately half the magnitude of the effects reported in the original studies. The same paper examined the reproducibility rates and effect sizes by journal and discipline. Study replication rates were 23% for the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48% for Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, and 38% for Psychological Science. Studies in the field of cognitive psychology had a higher replication rate (50%) than studies in the field of social psychology (25%).[69] A study published in 2018 in Nature Human Behaviour replicated 21 social and behavioral science papers from Nature and Science, finding that only about 62% could successfully reproduce original results.[70][71] Similarly, in a study conducted under the auspices of the Center for Open Science, a team of 186 researchers from 60 different laboratories (representing 36 different nationalities from six different continents) conducted replications of 28 classic and contemporary findings in psychology.[72][73] The study's focus was not only whether the original papers' findings replicated but also the extent to which findings varied as a function of variations in samples and contexts. Overall, 50% of the 28 findings failed to replicate despite massive sample sizes. But if a finding replicated, then it replicated in most samples. If a finding was not replicated, then it failed to replicate with little variation across samples and contexts. This evidence is inconsistent with a proposed explanation that failures to replicate in psychology are likely due to changes in the sample between the original and replication study.[73] Results of a 2022 study suggest that many earlier brain–phenotype studies (\\"brain-wide association studies\\" (BWAS)) produced invalid conclusions as the replication of such studies requires samples from thousands of individuals due to small effect sizes.[74][75] In medicine Graphic of results and barriers. 193 experiments were designed, 87 were initiated, and 50 were completed. Results from The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology suggest most studies of the cancer research sector may not be replicable. Of 49 medical studies from 1990 to 2003 with more than 1000 citations, 92% found that the studied therapies were effective. Of these studies, 16% were contradicted by subsequent studies, 16% had found stronger effects than did subsequent studies, 44% were replicated, and 24% remained largely unchallenged.[76] A 2011 analysis by researchers with pharmaceutical company Bayer found that, at most, a quarter of Bayer's in-house findings replicated the original results.[77] But the analysis of Bayer's results found that the results that did replicate could often be successfully used for clinical applications.[78] In a 2012 paper, C. Glenn Begley, a biotech consultant working at Amgen, and Lee Ellis, a medical researcher at the University of Texas, found that only 11% of 53 pre-clinical cancer studies had replications that could confirm conclusions from the original studies.[79] In late 2021, The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology examined 53 top papers about cancer published between 2010 and 2012 and showed that among studies that provided sufficient information to be redone, the effect sizes were 85% smaller on average than the original findings.[80][81] A survey of cancer researchers found that half of them had been unable to reproduce a published result.[82] Another report estimated that almost half of randomized controlled trials contained flawed data (based on the analysis of anonymized individual participant data (IPD) from more than 150 trials).[83] In other disciplines In economics Economics has lagged behind other social sciences and psychology in its attempts to assess replication rates and increase the number of studies that attempt replication.[12] A 2016 study in the journal Science replicated 18 experimental studies published in two leading economics journals, The American Economic Review and the Quarterly Journal of Economics, between 2011 and 2014. It found that about 39% failed to reproduce the original results.[84][85][86] About 20% of studies published in The American Economic Review are contradicted by other studies despite relying on the same or similar data sets.[87] A study of empirical findings in the Strategic Management Journal found that about 30% of 27 retested articles showed statistically insignificant results for previously significant findings, whereas about 4% showed statistically significant results for previously insignificant findings.[88] In water resource management A 2019 study in Scientific Data estimated with 95% confidence that of 1,989 articles on water resources and management published in 2017, study results might be reproduced for only 0.6% to 6.8%, even if each of these articles were to provide sufficient information that allowed for replication.[89] Across fields A 2016 survey by Nature on 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility found that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiment results (including 87% of chemists, 77% of biologists, 69% of physicists and engineers, 67% of medical researchers, 64% of earth and environmental scientists, and 62% of all others), and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. But fewer than 20% had been contacted by another researcher unable to reproduce their work. The survey found that fewer than 31% of researchers believe that failure to reproduce results means that the original result is probably wrong, although 52% agree that a significant replication crisis exists. Most researchers said they still trust the published literature.[5][90] In 2010, Fanelli (2010)[91] found that 91.5% of psychiatry/psychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for, and concluded that the odds of this happening (a positive result) was around five times higher than in fields such as astronomy or geosciences. Fanelli argued that this is because researchers in \\"softer\\" sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases. Early analysis of result-blind peer review, which is less affected by publication bias, has estimated that 61% of result-blind studies in biomedicine and psychology have led to null results, in contrast to an estimated 5% to 20% in earlier research.[92] Causes The replication crisis may be triggered by the \\"generation of new data and scientific publications at an unprecedented rate\\" that leads to the \\"desperation to publish or perish\\" and a failure to adhere to good scientific practice.[93] Historical and sociological roots Predictions of an impending crisis in the quality control mechanism of science can be traced back several decades. Derek de Solla Price—considered the father of scientometrics, the quantitative study of science—predicted in 1963 that science could reach \\"senility\\" as a result of its own exponential growth.[94] Some present-day literature seems to vindicate this \\"overflow\\" prophecy, lamenting the decay in both attention and quality.[95][96] Historian Philip Mirowski argues that the decline of scientific quality can be connected to its commodification, especially spurred by the profit-driven decision of major corporations to outsource their research to universities and contract research organizations.[97] Social systems theory, as expounded in the work of German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, inspires a similar diagnosis. This theory holds that each system, such as economy, science, religion or media, communicates using its own code: true and false for science, profit and loss for the economy, news and no-news for the media, and so on.[98][99] According to some sociologists, science's mediatization,[100] its commodification [97] and its politicization,[100][101] as a result of the structural coupling among systems, have led to a confusion of the original system codes. Economist Noah Smith suggests that a factor in the crisis has been the overvaluing of research in academia and undervaluing of teaching ability, especially in fields with few major recent discoveries.[102] Fourth Real life situation: While the authors agree with John Ioannidis that \\"most research findings are false,\\" here they show that replication of research findings enhances the positive predictive value of research findings being true. We know there is a lot of lack of replication in research findings, most notably in the field of genetic associations [1–3]. For example, a survey of 600 positive associations between gene variants and common diseases showed that out of 166 reported associations studied three or more times, only six were replicated consistently [4]. Lack of replication results from a number of factors such as publication bias, selection bias, Type I errors, population stratification (the mixture of individuals from heterogeneous genetic backgrounds), and lack of statistical power [5]. In a recent article in PLoS Medicine, John Ioannidis quantified the theoretical basis for lack of replication by deriving the positive predictive value (PPV) of the truth of a research finding on the basis of a combination of factors. He showed elegantly that most claimed research findings are false [6]. One of his findings was that the more scientific teams involved in studying the subject, the less likely the research findings from individual studies are to be true. The rapid early succession of contradictory conclusions is called the “Proteus phenomenon” [7]. For several independent studies of equal power, Ioannidis showed that the probability of a research finding being true when one or more studies find statistically significant results declines with increasing number of studies. As part of the scientific enterprise, we know that replication—the performance of another study statistically confirming the same hypothesis—is the cornerstone of science and replication of findings is very important before any causal inference can be drawn. While the importance of replication is also acknowledged by Ioannidis, he does not show how PPVs of research findings increase when more studies have statistically significant results. In this essay, we demonstrate the value of replication by extending Ioannidis' analyses to calculation of the PPV when multiple studies show statistically significant results. The probability that a study yields a statistically significant result depends on the nature of the underlying relationship. The probability is 1 - ß (one minus the Type II error rate) if the relationship is true, and a (Type I error rate) when the relationship is false, i.e., there is no relationship. Similarly, the probability that r out of n studies yield statistically significant results also depends on whether the underlying relationship is true or not. Let B(p,r,n) denote the probability of obtaining at least r statistically significant results out of n independent and identical studies, with p being the probability of a statistically significant result. B(p,r,n) is calculated as equation image In this formula, p is 1 - ß when the underlying relationship is true and a when it is false. Let R be the pre-study odds and c be the number of relationships being probed in the field. The pre-study probability of a relationship being true is given by R/(R + 1). The expected values of the 2 × 2 table are given in Table 1. When r is equal to one, entries in Table 1 are identical to those in Table 3 of Ioannidis [6]. The probability that, in the absence of bias, at least r out of n independent studies find statistically significant results is given by (RB(1 - ß,r,n) + B(α,r,n))/(R + 1) and the PPV when at least r studies are statistically significant is RB(1 - ß,r,n)/((RB(1 - ß,r,n) + B(α,r,n)). Table 1 Research Findings and True Relationships in the Presence of Multiple Studies An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is pmed.0040028.t001.jpg Go to: Positive Predictive Value as a Function of Study Replication We examine the PPV as a function of the number of statistically significant findings. Figure 1 shows the PPV of at least one, two, or three statistically significant research findings out of ten independent studies as a function of the pre-study odds of a true relationship (R) for powers of 20% and 80%. The lower lines correspond to Ioannidis' finding and indicate the probability of a true association when at least one out of ten studies shows a statistically significant result. As can be seen, the PPV is substantially higher when more research findings are statistically significant. Thus, a few positive replications can considerably enhance our confidence that the research findings reflect a true relationship. When R ranged from 0.0001 to 0.01, a higher number of positive studies is required to attain a reasonable PPV. The difference in PPV for power of 80% and power of 20% when at least three studies are positive is higher than when at least one study is positive. Figure 2 gives the PPV for increasing number of positive studies out of ten, 25, and 50 studies for pre-study odds of 0.0001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5 for powers of 20% and 80%. When there is at least one positive study (r = 1) and power equal to 80%, as indicated in Ioannidis' paper, PPV declined approximately 50% for 50 studies compared to ten studies for R values between 0.0001 and 0.1. However, PPV increases with increasing number of positive studies and the percentage of positive studies required to achieve a given PPV declines with increasing number of studies. The number of positive studies required to achieve a PPV of at least 70% increased from eight for ten studies to 12 for 50 studies when pre-study odds equaled 0.0001, from five for ten studies to eight for 50 studies when pre-study odds equaled 0.01, from three for ten studies to six for 50 studies when pre-study odds equaled 0.1, and from two for ten studies to five for 50 studies when pre-study odds equaled 0.5. The difference in PPV for powers of 80% and 20% declines with increasing number of studies.

Go to: Probability Distribution of Statistically Significant Results Although the PPV increases with increasing statistically significant results, the probability of obtaining at least r significant results declines with increasing r. This probability and the corresponding PPV for pre-study odds of 0.0001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5 are given for ten studies in Table 2. When power is 20% and pre-study odds are 0.0001, the probability of obtaining at least three statistically significant results is 1% and the corresponding PPV is 0.3%. This probability and the corresponding PPV increase with increasing pre-study odds. For example, when R = 0.1, the probability of obtaining at least three significant results is 4% and the PPV is 74%. As expected, both the probability of obtaining statistically significant results and the corresponding PPV increase with increasing power. However, for very small R values (around 0.0001), the increase in power has a minimal impact in the probability of obtaining at least one, two, or three statistically significant results. When power is 80%, the probability of obtaining at least three statistically significant results is 1.2% and the corresponding PPV is 0.9% for R = 0.0001, and when pre-study odds are 0.1, the probability of obtaining at least three statistically significant results increases to 10% and the corresponding PPV to 90%.

The editor emphasized that when authors submit manuscripts reporting genetic associations, the study should include an effect size and it should contain either a replication in an independent sample or physiologically meaningful data supporting a functional role of the polymorphism in question. While we acknowledge that our assumptions of identical design, power, and level of significance reflect a somewhat simplified scenario of replication, we quantified the positive predictive value of true research findings for increasing numbers of significant results. True replication, however, requires a precise process where the exact same finding is reexamined in the same way. More often than not, genuine replication is not done, and what we end up with in the literature is corroboration or indirect supporting evidence. While this may be acceptable to some extent in any scientific enterprise, the distance from this to data dredging, moving the goal post, and other selective reporting biases is often very small and can contribute to “pseudo” replication. Replication does not mean that we can have underpowered studies; even when we have several underpowered studies replicate a finding, the PPV remains low. Good replication practices require adequately powered studies. More generally, meta-analysis is a more useful approach to assess the totality of evidence in a body of work. Ioannidis discussed the importance of meta-analysis, and its weaknesses in cases where even the meta-analysis is underpowered. Our calculations have not considered the possibility of bias, i.e., selective reporting problems that may change some “negative” results to “positive” or may leave “negative” results unpublished. John Ioannidis has shown that modest bias can decrease the PPV steeply [6]. Therefore if replication is to work in genuinely increasing the PPV of research claims, it should be coupled with full transparency and non-selective reporting of research results. Note that when hypotheses are one-sided, according to our definition of replication, we only consider hypotheses that are in the same direction. Under this definition, statistically significant results in both directions do not arise. However, in meta-analysis, one can combine results that are significant in opposite directions. Calculations in a formal meta-analysis may not square fully with the inference presented here, since meta-analysis would incorporate both effect sizes and their uncertainty rather than just the “positive” versus “negative” inference. For example, we may have the necessary number of “positive” studies, but if the observed “positive” effects are small and all the other studies have trends in the opposite direction, the summary effect may well be null. In summary, while we agree with Ioannidis that most research findings are false, we clearly demonstrate that replication of research findings enhances the positive predictive value of research findings being true. While this is not unexpected, it should be encouraging news to researchers in their never-ending pursuit of scientific hypothesis generation and testing. Nevertheless, more methodologic work is needed to assess and interpret cumulative evidence of research findings and their biological plausibility. This is especially urgent in the exploding field of genetic associations. USe a real life situation for each AOK and give one counterclaim to it. Write in essay format about 1600 words","output":"Title: The Persistence of Custodianship: Balancing Tradition and Technological Change In the territory of knowledge, custodians act as stewards—guardians, curators, and upholders of wisdom. These entities, be they individuals or institutions, exemplify Philip Abelson's belief in an \\"effective\\" and \\"easily accessible\\" system of knowledge sharing. Their role has historically been pivotal, yet in an era that boasts unprecedented technological advancements and the ever-expansive reach of the internet, a pertinent question arises: Do we need custodians of knowledge in today’s world? This inquiry is particularly resonant when exploring the realms of the Arts and the Natural Sciences, where the tension between established guardianship and the liberating capabilities of digital technology paints a complex picture. # Arts – Custodians of Tradition and Origin **Claim: Upholding the Integrity of Cultural Narratives** **Real-Life Example**: The controversy over the chart categorization of Lil Nas X's \\"Old Town Road\\" in March 2019 serves to highlight the role of custodians in the arts. Billboard removed the song from its country chart, suggesting it did not \\"embrace enough elements of today’s country music.\\" This action by a traditional gatekeeper not only altered the trajectory of the song’s success but also rekindled the discourse on genre boundaries and racial dynamics within the music industry — underscoring the custodian’s role in defining and safeguarding cultural narratives. **Counterclaim**: The rise of social media platforms, particularly TikTok's role in the \\"Yee Haw Challenge,\\" exemplifies how new technologies enable artists to bypass traditional custodians and reach audiences organically. The song's success, fueled by a viral meme rather than industry classification, suggests that the collective engagement of a digitally connected audience might now suffice to champion and categorize art. # Natural Sciences – Custodians of Validity and Trust **Claim: Ensuring Credibility and Reproducibility** **Real-Life Example**: The replication crisis, especially evident since the early 2010s, has emphasized the need for custodians in the sciences. The discovery that many studies, particularly in psychology and medicine, could not be reproduced, has led to an ongoing dialogue about the credibility of scientific research. Custodians, in the form of peer reviewers, journal editors, and scientific committees, are called upon to enact more stringent verification processes to maintain trust within the scientific community and the public at large. **Counterclaim**: The institutionalization of knowledge checking has not always averted the replication crisis. Some argue that the scientific method, in its purest form, contains within it a self-correcting mechanism. Open-source repositories and preprint archives are modern embodiments of this philosophy, decentralizing the custodial role and potentially fostering a more robust dialogue within the scientific community. # Do We Still Need Custodians? **Comparative Analysis**: In considering these contrasts, a common theme emerges: while the digital world offers unprecedented opportunities for knowledge dissemination, the need for custodians in mediating this knowledge persists. In the arts, custodians provide a societal touchstone, a means of contextualizing culture within the frameworks of tradition and expectation. In contrast, in the sciences, custodians stand as guardians of methodological integrity, ensuring the reproducibility that undergirds empirical knowledge. # Conclusion In summary, despite the immense potential of the internet to democratize knowledge, the persistence of custodianship prevails. The current digital epoch has thus far increased rather than supplanted the need for knowledgeable stewards. While the mode of custodianship may evolve alongside technological change—shifting from centralized gatekeeping to distributed oversight—the core function of validating and curating knowledge withstands. It is within this synthesis, navigating both continuity and transformation, that custodians of today must operate, embracing change while grounding us in the principles that have long ensured the maintenance and integrity of our collective wisdom."},{"instruction":"You forgot to include the two other real life examples, include them in another version","output":"Title: Custodianship Amidst Digital Frontiers: Preserving Knowledge Integrity in the Arts and Sciences The guardians of knowledge—custodians—have long stood as sentinels over the repositories of human understanding. Conceptualized as guardians, curators, and upholders, these key figures foster the progression and transmission of intellectual heritage. Yet, as the digital age reshapes access to information, a crucial question emerges: Do we still need custodians of knowledge? In examining this issue through the lens of the Arts and Natural Sciences, I argue for the continued relevance of custodians despite an evolving role in the face of technological advancement. # Arts - Preservers of Cultural Heritage **Claim: Custodians as Defenders of Contextual Integrity** **Real-Life Example**: The tumultuous journey of Lil Nas X's \\"Old Town Road\\" exemplifies the authoritative role of custodians within the Arts. In March 2019, Billboard removed the song from its country chart, positing that it lacked the essential characteristics of the genre. This decision by an established industry custodian had profound implications, catapulting the debate surrounding genre definitions and inclusivity to the forefront of popular music discourse. **Counterclaim**: Conversely, the digital era empowers content creators to directly engage with their audience, bypassing traditional gatekeepers. The “Yee Haw Challenge” on TikTok played a pivotal role in popularizing \\"Old Town Road,\\" suggesting that cultural arbitration may be shifting from industry custodians to the democratized realm of social media engagement. **Real-Life Example (Counterclaim)**: The 1863 Salon des Refusés in Paris stands as a historical counterpoint. When established custodians—academics from the French government's Salon—rejected numerous artworks, Emperor Napoleon III demanded these works be displayed in an alternate exhibition. Key figures like Édouard Manet found an audience, and the event ultimately propelled the Impressionist movement, showcasing how even historical custodians faced challenges to their authority, leading to transformative moments in artistic expression. # Natural Sciences - Validators of Empirical Knowledge **Claim: Custodians as Protectors of Scientific Rigor** **Real-Life Example**: The replication crisis in sciences, recognized in the early 2010s, underscores the pivotal role of custodians. Peer reviewers, funding agencies, and journal editors are entrusted to evaluate and verify empirical findings, ensuring reliability and building public trust in scientific outcomes. **Counterclaim**: Yet, the replication crisis also suggests that the custodian system is fallible. The rapid expansion of scientific knowledge, coupled with inherent biases in traditional publication models, has contributed to this issue. Alternative platforms like arXiv.org have emerged, enabling direct dissemination and critique of scientific work in real-time, positing that collegial scrutiny within the scientific community might sufficiently uphold standards of research. **Real-Life Example (Counterclaim)**: Emergent technologies question the monopoly of traditional custodianship in science. Recently, approaches to preprint publication and open access material, as seen with the founding of bioRxiv in 2013, are changing the landscape. By facilitating immediate, unrestricted access to scientific manuscripts prior to peer review, bioRxiv embodies the transformative potential of the internet to democratize scientific knowledge. # Do Custodians Still Matter? **Comparative Analysis**: The capacity for the internet to store, archive, and disseminate information at an unprecedented scale has not rendered custodians obsolete. Both in the Arts and Natural Sciences, custodians continue to provide vital services: in the arts, by preserving the context and nuanced understanding of cultural works; in the sciences, by maintaining standards of empirical rigor and replication. However, digital tools and platforms are reframing how custodial roles are fulfilled, prompting a reevaluation but not a repudiation of their significance. # Conclusion In navigating the intersection between tradition and innovation, it becomes clear that custodians remain indispensable to both the Arts and Natural Sciences, even as their roles evolve to adapt to the digital paradigm. Custodians are vital in preserving the lineage and integrity of knowledge, ensuring its contextual relevance, and upholding empirical standards against the tide of misinformation that can accompany digital liberty. Despite the challenges, these watchmen of knowledge remain central to the architecture of our collective intellect, ensuring that the pursuit of understanding remains rigorous, authentic, and trustworthy. The digital age has redefined, not replaced, the need for custodians, integrating age-old guardianship with the new dynamics of the information society."},{"instruction":"Put everything together in a lenghty text where each paragraph is big and the analysis is profound. Use all the real life examples","output":"Title: Navigating the Digital Knowledge Frontier: The Indispensable Role of Custodianship In an age where the democratization of information through digital means is ostensibly boundless, the traditional role of knowledge custodians is often called into question. These guardians, curators, and upholders of knowledge—be it in the academia, arts, or sciences—have acted as the Medici of intellectual heritage, fostering its advancement and ensuring its sanctity. Yet, this essay posits that despite the transformational potential of the digital era, the role of custodian remains a fundamental necessity, albeit with adaptation to new modalities of knowledge and communication. Through a deep analysis of the custodial function across the Arts and Natural Sciences, we traverse historical precedents, contemporary challenges, and digital evolution to underscore the enduring need for informed stewardship in an increasingly connected world. In the domain of the Arts, custodianship entails not only preservation but also contextual understanding and categorical determination. This role was brought to the fore in the modern musical landscape when, in March 2019, Lil Nas X's song \\"Old Town Road\\" was removed from Billboard's country charts. The decision brought industry-defined genre boundaries into the limelight, revealing the custodians' role as arbiters of not only quality but also cultural identity within musical expressions. Billboard, acting as a traditional custodian, dictated the confines of the country genre, inadvertently sparking a broader conversation on inclusivity and genre fluidity in music. This critical event highlighted the necessity for custodian intrusion when it came to maintaining the categorical integrity that audiences and artists rely upon for navigation and identity within the cultural milieu. Conversely, this decision by Billboard was met with a democratized response through the viral \\"Yee Haw Challenge\\" on TikTok, which saw Lil Nas X's genre-transcending hit achieve monumental success outside the traditional gatekeeping mechanisms. This digital wave of public support outmaneuvered the conventional top-down approach, suggesting a shift in the custodial paradigm. The notion of gatekeeping, and by extension custodianship, seemed momentarily antiquated in the face of a grassroots, digitally-driven consecration of \\"Old Town Road\\" as a cultural phenomenon unconstrained by historical genre classifications. This tension between conventional custodianship and digital democratization echoes across time, reaching back to the 19th century with the seminal Salon des Refusés in 1863. When the French Academy of Fine Arts, acting as a custodian of artistic standards, rejected works from artists such as Manet and Pissarro for exhibition in the official Paris Salon, it sparked outrage. The resulting exhibition of these rejected works, sanctioned by Emperor Napoleon III, exemplified the necessity and power of custodianship to either validate or, contrarily, to instigate reform in artistic practices. The Salon des Refusés subverted custodial judgement and became a testament to the evolving qualifications of what constituted \\"acceptable\\" art, ultimately contributing to the rise of the Impressionist movement. Both historical and modern examples reveal that custodianship is not only about ensuring continuity but is also closely intertwined with evolving cultural narratives that define artistic endeavor. Shifting to the realm of Natural Sciences, the custodian's role is discernibly axiomatic. As evident from the reproducibility crisis increasingly recognized from the early 2010s, scientific research has been plunged into a state of introspection due to the struggle to replicate findings across various disciplines. The replication crisis has highlighted the essential function of custodians—in the form of editorial boards, peer reviewers, and funding bodies—to vouchsafe the rigor, authenticity, and credibility of scientific inquiry. This responsibility ensures the establishment of trust, both within the scientific community and with the public whose lives are affected by its findings. The gravitas of these concerns interweaves with the story of the emergence of the preprint server bioRxiv in 2013, a digital platform that enables scientists to share their research openly before it has undergone peer review. By circumventing the slower, more traditional pathways of academic publishing, bioRxiv represents a digital challenge to the accepted structures of custodianship. It is reflective of a trend towards open access, transparency, and the decentralization of gatekeeping in the scientific process. However, it has become evident that this evolution does not signal an obsolescence of custodians but rather a transformation in their role from gatekeepers to facilitators and \\"curators\\" of a dynamic and more open dialogue around scientific research. In surveying these various manifestations of custodianship across temporal, cultural, and disciplinary contexts, it becomes clear that the maintenance of intellectual standards, the contextualization of cultural output, and the validation of empirical evidence are duties that the very architecture of knowledge depends upon. The rise of the internet, while instrumental in reframing how custodianship is realized, has not diminished the necessity for these arbiters of knowledge. It has, paradoxically, increased the need for thoughtful stewardship amidst the digitized expanse of information. Custodians thus persist as an indispensable force, ensuring that the surfeit of content available in the digital landscape is not only accessible but also accurate, meaningful, and congruent with the continuing journey of human discovery. In conclusion, the exploration and analysis of the custodial function across the Arts and Natural Sciences, fortified by historical and contemporary narratives, reveal that custodians remain integral to the integrity of knowledge. As the digital environment evolves and reshapes the modalities of expression, communication, and investigation, so too must the custodian adapt. Today's custodian must harmonize the balance between tradition and change, wielding the tools of the digital age as instruments for the deepened curation and guardianship of our collective intellectual and cultural tapestry. Custodianship, in its essence, has not been supplanted by technological advance; rather, it has been called to rise to the challenges and opportunities such transformation presents. The need for custodians—defenders, upholders, and curators of knowledge—endures, as they nurture the roots of wisdom and enable its branches to reach ever skyward in the digital age."},{"instruction":"First source: The 2019 MTV Video Music Awards aired on Monday, August 26, and featured performances by Lizzo, Missy Elliott, Normani, Taylor Swift, and Lil Nas X, among others. Together with Billy Ray Cyrus, Lil Nas X was one of the artists to receive the most nominations heading into the night; the pair picked up eight total nominations for their collaboration on “Old Town Road”: video of the year, song of the year, best new artist, best collaboration, best hip hop, best direction, best editing, and best art direction. Ultimately, they took home the award for song of the year. But the road to success for the ode to the cowboy life, released in December 2018, hasn’t always been a smooth ride. A number of factors have contributed to Lil Nas X’s popularity, particularly the debate over whether “Old Town Road” should be classified as country music. Earlier this year, Billboard removed “Old Town Road” from its country chart, which boosted the rapper’s profile to a wider audience while fueling a debate about what defines country music and who gets to decide. But even before Billboard stepped in, Lil Nas X had found fans through his popular meme-filled Twitter presence and a fast-growing TikTok meme dubbed the “Yee Haw Challenge” that centered on the song.

But the following week it was gone — having been moved to the Hot Rap Songs chart, where it entered at No. 24. “Upon further review, it was determined that ‘Old Town Road’ by Lil Nas X does not currently merit inclusion on Billboard‘s country charts,” a Billboard representative told Rolling Stone, which reported on the reclassification on March 26. “When determining genres, a few factors are examined, but first and foremost is musical composition. While ‘Old Town Road’ incorporates references to country and cowboy imagery, it does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version.” Vox’s Allegra Frank wrote: The backlash was immediate, as many people criticized Billboard for feeding rigid ideas about who or what qualifies as country enough and argued that Lil Nas X’s race played a part in the song’s reclassification. Namely, the fact that Lil Nas X is a black teenager from Atlanta and country is a predominantly white genre did not go unnoticed. “Old Town Road” eventually rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 — on the rapper’s birthday, no less. The song would go on to become the Billboard Hot 100’s longest-running No. 1 ever. But the debate itself represents a deep divide within country music. On this episode of Today, Explained, Vox Culture Editor Allegra Frank chronicles Lil Nas X’s challenges with the charts and Charlie Harding, co-host of the Switched on Pop podcast, attempts to figure out what counts as country. Second real life situation: From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For the Australian art exhibition, see Salon des Refusés (Archibald). The Palais de l’Industrie, where the event took place. Photo by Édouard Baldus. The Salon des Refusés, French for “exhibition of rejects” (French pronunciation: [salɔ̃ dɜ ʁəfyze]), is generally known as an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official Paris Salon, but the term is most famously used to refer to the Salon des Refusés of 1863.[1][2] Today, by extension, salon des refusés refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show. Background of the Salon of 1863 The Paris Salon, sponsored by the French government and the Academy of Fine Arts, took place annually, and was a showcase of the best academic art. A medal from the Salon was assurance of a successful artistic career; winners were given official commissions by the French government, and were sought after for portraits and private commissions. Since the 18th century, the paintings were classified by genre, following a specific hierarchy; history paintings were ranked first, followed by the portrait, the landscape, the “genre scene”, and the still life. The jury, headed by the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, the head of the Academy of Fine Arts, was very conservative; near-photographic but idealized realism was expected.[3] Much intrigue often went on to get acceptance, and to be given a good place in the galleries. In 1851, Gustave Courbet managed to get one painting into the Salon, Enterrement à Ornans, and in 1852 his Baigneuses was accepted, scandalizing critics and the public, who expected romanticized nudes in classical settings, but in 1855 the Salon refused all of Courbet’s paintings. As early as the 1830s, Paris art galleries mounted small-scale, private exhibitions of works rejected by the Salon jurors. Courbet was obliged to organize his own exhibit, called The Pavillon of Realism, at a private gallery. Private exhibits attracted far less attention from the press and patrons, and limited the access of the artists to a small public. In 1863 the Salon jury refused two thirds of the paintings presented, including the works of Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Antoine Chintreuil, and Johan Jongkind. The rejected artists and their friends protested, and the protests reached Emperor Napoleon III. The Emperor’s tastes in art were traditional; he commissioned and bought works by artists such as Alexandre Cabanel and Franz Xaver Winterhalter, but he was also sensitive to public opinion. His office issued a statement: “Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition. His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry.”[4] More than a thousand visitors a day visited the Salon des Refusés. The journalist Émile Zola reported that visitors pushed to get into the crowded galleries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter of the spectators.[5] Critics and the public ridiculed the refusés, which included such now-famous paintings as Édouard Manet’s Déjeuner sur l’herbe and James McNeill Whistler’s Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl. But the critical attention also legitimized the emerging avant-garde in painting. The Impressionists successfully exhibited their works outside the traditional Salon beginning in 1874. Subsequent Salons des Refusés were mounted in Paris in 1874, 1875, and 1886, by which time the popularity of the Paris Salon had declined for those who were more interested in Impressionism. Works in the exhibition Le déjeuner sur l’herbe Main article: Le déjeuner sur l’herbe The Luncheon on the Grass French: Le déjeuner sur l’herbe Artist Édouard Manet Year 1862–1863 Medium Oil on canvas Dimensions 208 cm × 265.5 cm (81.9 in × 104.5 in) Location Musée d’Orsay, Paris Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit Déjeuner sur l’herbe and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés.[6] Déjeuner sur l’herbe depicts the juxtaposition of a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, even to this day. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past. One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution in the Bois de Boulogne, a large park at the western outskirts of Paris, at the time. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.[7] Émile Zola comments about Déjeuner sur l’herbe: The Luncheon on the Grass is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging The Luncheon on the Grass like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of The Luncheon on the Grass is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.[8] Émile Zola incorporated a fictionalized account of the 1863 scandal in his novel L’Œuvre (The Masterpiece) (1886). Symphony in White no 1 Main article: Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl Artist James McNeill Whistler Year 1861–62 Medium Oil on canvas Dimensions 215 cm × 108 cm (84.5 in × 42.5 in) Location National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. In 1861, after returning to Paris for a time, James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted his first famous work, Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl. This portrait of his mistress and business manager Joanna Hiffernan was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary thought the painting an allegory of a new bride’s lost innocence. Others linked it to Wilkie Collins’s The Woman in White, a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the Pre-Raphaelite manner.[9] In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a wolf skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the wolf’s head staring menacingly at the viewer. Countering criticism by traditionalists, Whistler’s supporters insisted that the painting was “an apparition with a spiritual content” and that it epitomized his theory that art should be concerned essentially with the arrangement of colors in harmony, not with a literal portrayal of the natural world.[10] Whistler started working on The White Girl shortly after December 3, 1861, with the intention of submitting it to the prestigious annual exhibition of the Royal Academy. In spite of bouts of illness, he finished the painting by April.[11] The white paint Whistler used contained lead, and his work on the seven-foot-high canvas had given the artist a dose of lead poisoning.[12] The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy in London. Whistler then submitted the painting to the Paris Salon of 1863, where it was also rejected. The public was able to see the painting exhibited with other rejected works, in the Salon des Refusés. The Salon des Refusés was an event sanctioned by Emperor Napoleon III, to appease the large number of artists who joined forces to protest the harsh jury decisions in 1863[12] Of the over 5,000 paintings submitted in 1863, 2,217 were rejected. In a letter to George du Maurier in early 1862 Whistler wrote of the painting: … a woman in a beautiful white cambric dress, standing against a window which filters the light through a transparent white muslin curtain – but the figure receives a strong light from the right and therefore the picture, barring the red hair, is one gorgeous mass of brilliant white.[13] Whistler submitted the painting to the Academy, but according to Joanna Hiffernan, he expected it to be rejected.[11] The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. Edwin Henry Landseer’s The Shrew Tamed showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert,[14] a noted equestrienne of the period,[15] however it was soon rumored that it was actually Catherine Walters, the notorious London courtesan.[16] Whistler’s painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer’s that the judges were wary of admitting it.[17] White Girl was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not.[18] Whistler exhibited it at the small Berners Street Gallery in London instead.[13] The next year, Whistler tried to have the painting exhibited at the Salon in Paris – the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts – but it was rejected there as well.[19] Instead, it was accepted at the alternative Salon des Refusés – the “exhibition of rejects” that opened on May 15, two weeks after the official Salon.[20] Although Whistler’s painting was widely noticed, he was upstaged by Manet’s more shocking painting Le déjeuner sur l’herbe.[19] The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in Émile Zola’s novel L’Œuvre (1886).[11] The reception Whistler’s painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris.[21] The painting was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter Gustave Courbet and the poet Charles Baudelaire. The art critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger saw it in the tradition of Goya and Velázquez. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.[22] Third real life situation(AOK of sciences) The replication crisis (also called the replicability crisis and the reproducibility crisis) is an ongoing methodological crisis in which the results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce. Because the reproducibility of empirical results is an essential part of the scientific method,[2] such failures undermine the credibility of theories building on them and potentially call into question substantial parts of scientific knowledge. The replication crisis is frequently discussed in relation to psychology and medicine, where considerable efforts have been undertaken to reinvestigate classic results, to determine whether they are reliable, and if they turn out not to be, the reasons for the failure.[3][4] Data strongly indicates that other natural and social sciences are affected as well.[5] The phrase replication crisis was coined in the early 2010s[6] as part of a growing awareness of the problem. Considerations of causes and remedies have given rise to a new scientific discipline, metascience,[7] which uses methods of empirical research to examine empirical research practice. Considerations about reproducibility fall into two categories. Reproducibility in the narrow sense refers to re-examining and validating the analysis of a given set of data. Replication refers to repeating the experiment or study to obtain new, independent data with the goal of reaching the same or similar conclusions. Background Replication has been called “the cornerstone of science”.[8][9] Environmental health scientist Stefan Schmidt began a 2009 review with this description of replication: Replication is one of the central issues in any empirical science. To confirm results or hypotheses by a repetition procedure is at the basis of any scientific conception. A replication experiment to demonstrate that the same findings can be obtained in any other place by any other researcher is conceived as an operationalization of objectivity. It is the proof that the experiment reflects knowledge that can be separated from the specific circumstances (such as time, place, or persons) under which it was gained.[10] But there is limited consensus on how to define replication and potentially related concepts.[11][12][10] A number of types of replication have been identified: Direct or exact replication, where an experimental procedure is repeated as closely as possible.[10][13] Systematic replication, where an experimental procedure is largely repeated, with some intentional changes.[13] Conceptual replication, where a finding or hypothesis is tested using a different procedure.[10][13] Conceptual replication allows testing for generalizability and veracity of a result or hypothesis.[13] Reproducibility can also be distinguished from replication, as referring to reproducing the same results using the same data set. Reproducibility of this type is why many researchers make their data available to others for testing.[14] The replication crisis does not necessarily mean these fields are unscientific.[15][16][17] Rather, this process is part of the scientific process in which old ideas or those that cannot withstand careful scrutiny are pruned,[18][19] although this pruning process is not always effective.[20][21] A hypothesis is generally considered to be supported when the results match the predicted pattern and that pattern of results is found to be statistically significant. Results are considered significant whenever the relative frequency of the observed pattern falls below an arbitrarily chosen value (i.e. the significance level) when assuming the null hypothesis is true. This generally answers the question of how unlikely results would be if no difference existed at the level of the statistical population. If the probability associated with the test statistic exceeds the chosen critical value, the results are considered statistically significant.[22] The corresponding probability of exceeding the critical value is depicted as p < 0.05, where p (typically referred to as the “p-value”) is the probability level. This should result in 5% of hypotheses that are supported being false positives (an incorrect hypothesis being erroneously found correct), assuming the studies meet all of the statistical assumptions. Some fields use smaller p-values, such as p < 0.01 (1% chance of a false positive) or p < 0.001 (0.1% chance of a false positive). But a smaller chance of a false positive often requires greater sample sizes or a greater chance of a false negative (a correct hypothesis being erroneously found incorrect). Although p-value testing is the most commonly used method, it is not the only method. History The beginning of the replication crisis can be traced to a number of events in the early 2010s. Philosopher of science and social epistemologist Felipe Romero identified four events that can be considered precursors to the ongoing crisis:[23] Controversies around social priming research: In the early 2010s, the well-known “elderly-walking” study[24] by social psychologist John Bargh and colleagues failed to replicate in two direct replications.[25] This experiment was part of a series of three studies that had been widely cited throughout the years, was regularly taught in university courses, and had inspired a large number of conceptual replications. Failures to replicate the study led to much controversy and a heated debate involving the original authors.[26] Notably, many of the conceptual replications of the original studies also failed to replicate in subsequent direct replications.[27][28][29][30] Controversies around experiments on extrasensory perception: Social psychologist Daryl Bem conducted a series of experiments supposedly providing evidence for the controversial phenomenon of extrasensory perception.[31] Bem was highly criticized for his study’s methodology and upon reanalysis of the data, no evidence was found for the existence of extrasensory perception.[32] The experiment also failed to replicate in subsequent direct replications.[33] According to Romero, what the community found particularly upsetting was that many of the flawed procedures and statistical tools used in Bem’s studies were part of common research practice in psychology. Amgen and Bayer reports on lack of replicability in biomedical research: Scientists from biotech companies Amgen and Bayer Healthcare reported alarmingly low replication rates (11-20%) of landmark findings in preclinical oncological research.[34][35] Publication of studies on p-hacking and questionable research practices: Since the late 2000s, a number of studies in metascience showed how commonly adopted practices in many scientific fields, such as exploiting the flexibility of the process of data collection and reporting, could greatly increase the probability of false positive results.[36][37][38] These studies suggested how a significant proportion of published literature in several scientific fields could be nonreplicable research. This series of events generated a great deal of skepticism about the validity of existing research in light of widespread methodological flaws and failures to replicate findings. This led prominent scholars to declare a “crisis of confidence” in psychology and other fields,[39] and the ensuing situation came to be known as the “replication crisis”. Although the beginning of the replication crisis can be traced to the early 2010s, some authors point out that concerns about replicability and research practices in the social sciences had been expressed much earlier. Romero notes that authors voiced concerns about the lack of direct replications in psychological research in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[40][41] He also writes that certain studies in the 1990s were already reporting that journal editors and reviewers are generally biased against publishing replication studies.[42][43] In the social sciences, the blog Data Colada (whose three authors coined the term “p-hacking” in a 2014 paper) has been credited with contributing to the start of the replication crisis.[44][45][46] University of Virginia professor and cognitive psychologist Barbara A. Spellman has written that many criticisms of research practices and concerns about replicability of research are not new.[47] She reports that between the late 1950s and the 1990s, scholars were already expressing concerns about a possible crisis of replication,[48] a suspiciously high rate of positive findings,[49] questionable research practices (QRPs),[50] the effects of publication bias,[51] issues with statistical power,[52][53] and bad standards of reporting.[48] Spellman also identifies reasons that the reiteration of these criticisms and concerns in recent years led to a full-blown crisis and challenges to the status quo. First, technological improvements facilitated conducting and disseminating replication studies, and analyzing large swaths of literature for systemic problems. Second, the research community’s increasing size and diversity made the work of established members more easily scutinized by other community members unfamiliar with them. According to Spellman, these factors, coupled with increasingly limited resources and misaligned incentives for doing scientific work, led to a crisis in psychology and other fields.[47] [icon] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (April 2023) Prevalence In psychology Several factors have combined to put psychology at the center of the conversation.[54][55] Some areas of psychology once considered solid, such as social priming, have come under increased scrutiny due to failed replications.[56] Much of the focus has been on the area of social psychology,[57] although other areas of psychology such as clinical psychology,[58][59][60] developmental psychology,[61][62][63] and educational research have also been implicated.[64][65][66][67][68] In August 2015, the first open empirical study of reproducibility in psychology was published, called The Reproducibility Project: Psychology. Coordinated by psychologist Brian Nosek, researchers redid 100 studies in psychological science from three high-ranking psychology journals (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, and Psychological Science). 97 of the original studies had significant effects, but of those 97, only 36% of the replications yielded significant findings (p value below 0.05).[11] The mean effect size in the replications was approximately half the magnitude of the effects reported in the original studies. The same paper examined the reproducibility rates and effect sizes by journal and discipline. Study replication rates were 23% for the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48% for Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, and 38% for Psychological Science. Studies in the field of cognitive psychology had a higher replication rate (50%) than studies in the field of social psychology (25%).[69] A study published in 2018 in Nature Human Behaviour replicated 21 social and behavioral science papers from Nature and Science, finding that only about 62% could successfully reproduce original results.[70][71] Similarly, in a study conducted under the auspices of the Center for Open Science, a team of 186 researchers from 60 different laboratories (representing 36 different nationalities from six different continents) conducted replications of 28 classic and contemporary findings in psychology.[72][73] The study’s focus was not only whether the original papers’ findings replicated but also the extent to which findings varied as a function of variations in samples and contexts. Overall, 50% of the 28 findings failed to replicate despite massive sample sizes. But if a finding replicated, then it replicated in most samples. If a finding was not replicated, then it failed to replicate with little variation across samples and contexts. This evidence is inconsistent with a proposed explanation that failures to replicate in psychology are likely due to changes in the sample between the original and replication study.[73] Results of a 2022 study suggest that many earlier brain–phenotype studies (“brain-wide association studies” (BWAS)) produced invalid conclusions as the replication of such studies requires samples from thousands of individuals due to small effect sizes.[74][75] In medicine Graphic of results and barriers. 193 experiments were designed, 87 were initiated, and 50 were completed. Results from The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology suggest most studies of the cancer research sector may not be replicable. Of 49 medical studies from 1990 to 2003 with more than 1000 citations, 92% found that the studied therapies were effective. Of these studies, 16% were contradicted by subsequent studies, 16% had found stronger effects than did subsequent studies, 44% were replicated, and 24% remained largely unchallenged.[76] A 2011 analysis by researchers with pharmaceutical company Bayer found that, at most, a quarter of Bayer’s in-house findings replicated the original results.[77] But the analysis of Bayer’s results found that the results that did replicate could often be successfully used for clinical applications.[78] In a 2012 paper, C. Glenn Begley, a biotech consultant working at Amgen, and Lee Ellis, a medical researcher at the University of Texas, found that only 11% of 53 pre-clinical cancer studies had replications that could confirm conclusions from the original studies.[79] In late 2021, The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology examined 53 top papers about cancer published between 2010 and 2012 and showed that among studies that provided sufficient information to be redone, the effect sizes were 85% smaller on average than the original findings.[80][81] A survey of cancer researchers found that half of them had been unable to reproduce a published result.[82] Another report estimated that almost half of randomized controlled trials contained flawed data (based on the analysis of anonymized individual participant data (IPD) from more than 150 trials).[83] In other disciplines In economics Economics has lagged behind other social sciences and psychology in its attempts to assess replication rates and increase the number of studies that attempt replication.[12] A 2016 study in the journal Science replicated 18 experimental studies published in two leading economics journals, The American Economic Review and the Quarterly Journal of Economics, between 2011 and 2014. It found that about 39% failed to reproduce the original results.[84][85][86] About 20% of studies published in The American Economic Review are contradicted by other studies despite relying on the same or similar data sets.[87] A study of empirical findings in the Strategic Management Journal found that about 30% of 27 retested articles showed statistically insignificant results for previously significant findings, whereas about 4% showed statistically significant results for previously insignificant findings.[88] In water resource management A 2019 study in Scientific Data estimated with 95% confidence that of 1,989 articles on water resources and management published in 2017, study results might be reproduced for only 0.6% to 6.8%, even if each of these articles were to provide sufficient information that allowed for replication.[89] Across fields A 2016 survey by Nature on 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility found that more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiment results (including 87% of chemists, 77% of biologists, 69% of physicists and engineers, 67% of medical researchers, 64% of earth and environmental scientists, and 62% of all others), and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. But fewer than 20% had been contacted by another researcher unable to reproduce their work. The survey found that fewer than 31% of researchers believe that failure to reproduce results means that the original result is probably wrong, although 52% agree that a significant replication crisis exists. Most researchers said they still trust the published literature.[5][90] In 2010, Fanelli (2010)[91] found that 91.5% of psychiatry/psychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for, and concluded that the odds of this happening (a positive result) was around five times higher than in fields such as astronomy or geosciences. Fanelli argued that this is because researchers in “softer” sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases. Early analysis of result-blind peer review, which is less affected by publication bias, has estimated that 61% of result-blind studies in biomedicine and psychology have led to null results, in contrast to an estimated 5% to 20% in earlier research.[92] Causes The replication crisis may be triggered by the “generation of new data and scientific publications at an unprecedented rate” that leads to the “desperation to publish or perish” and a failure to adhere to good scientific practice.[93] Historical and sociological roots Predictions of an impending crisis in the quality control mechanism of science can be traced back several decades. Derek de Solla Price—considered the father of scientometrics, the quantitative study of science—predicted in 1963 that science could reach “senility” as a result of its own exponential growth.[94] Some present-day literature seems to vindicate this “overflow” prophecy, lamenting the decay in both attention and quality.[95][96] Historian Philip Mirowski argues that the decline of scientific quality can be connected to its commodification, especially spurred by the profit-driven decision of major corporations to outsource their research to universities and contract research organizations.[97] Social systems theory, as expounded in the work of German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, inspires a similar diagnosis. This theory holds that each system, such as economy, science, religion or media, communicates using its own code: true and false for science, profit and loss for the economy, news and no-news for the media, and so on.[98][99] According to some sociologists, science’s mediatization,[100] its commodification [97] and its politicization,[100][101] as a result of the structural coupling among systems, have led to a confusion of the original system codes. Economist Noah Smith suggests that a factor in the crisis has been the overvaluing of research in academia and undervaluing of teaching ability, especially in fields with few major recent discoveries.[102] Fourth Real life situation: While the authors agree with John Ioannidis that “most research findings are false,” here they show that replication of research findings enhances the positive predictive value of research findings being true. We know there is a lot of lack of replication in research findings, most notably in the field of genetic associations [1–3]. For example, a survey of 600 positive associations between gene variants and common diseases showed that out of 166 reported associations studied three or more times, only six were replicated consistently [4]. Lack of replication results from a number of factors such as publication bias, selection bias, Type I errors, population stratification (the mixture of individuals from heterogeneous genetic backgrounds), and lack of statistical power [5]. In a recent article in PLoS Medicine, John Ioannidis quantified the theoretical basis for lack of replication by deriving the positive predictive value (PPV) of the truth of a research finding on the basis of a combination of factors. He showed elegantly that most claimed research findings are false [6]. One of his findings was that the more scientific teams involved in studying the subject, the less likely the research findings from individual studies are to be true. The rapid early succession of contradictory conclusions is called the “Proteus phenomenon” [7]. For several independent studies of equal power, Ioannidis showed that the probability of a research finding being true when one or more studies find statistically significant results declines with increasing number of studies. As part of the scientific enterprise, we know that replication—the performance of another study statistically confirming the same hypothesis—is the cornerstone of science and replication of findings is very important before any causal inference can be drawn. While the importance of replication is also acknowledged by Ioannidis, he does not show how PPVs of research findings increase when more studies have statistically significant results. In this essay, we demonstrate the value of replication by extending Ioannidis’ analyses to calculation of the PPV when multiple studies show statistically significant results. The probability that a study yields a statistically significant result depends on the nature of the underlying relationship. The probability is 1 - ß (one minus the Type II error rate) if the relationship is true, and a (Type I error rate) when the relationship is false, i.e., there is no relationship. Similarly, the probability that r out of n studies yield statistically significant results also depends on whether the underlying relationship is true or not. Let B(p,r,n) denote the probability of obtaining at least r statistically significant results out of n independent and identical studies, with p being the probability of a statistically significant result. B(p,r,n) is calculated as equation image In this formula, p is 1 - ß when the underlying relationship is true and a when it is false. Let R be the pre-study odds and c be the number of relationships being probed in the field. The pre-study probability of a relationship being true is given by R/(R + 1). The expected values of the 2 × 2 table are given in Table 1. When r is equal to one, entries in Table 1 are identical to those in Table 3 of Ioannidis [6]. The probability that, in the absence of bias, at least r out of n independent studies find statistically significant results is given by (RB(1 - ß,r,n) + B(α,r,n))/(R + 1) and the PPV when at least r studies are statistically significant is RB(1 - ß,r,n)/((RB(1 - ß,r,n) + B(α,r,n)). Table 1 Research Findings and True Relationships in the Presence of Multiple Studies An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is pmed.0040028.t001.jpg Go to: Positive Predictive Value as a Function of Study Replication We examine the PPV as a function of the number of statistically significant findings. Figure 1 shows the PPV of at least one, two, or three statistically significant research findings out of ten independent studies as a function of the pre-study odds of a true relationship ® for powers of 20% and 80%. The lower lines correspond to Ioannidis’ finding and indicate the probability of a true association when at least one out of ten studies shows a statistically significant result. As can be seen, the PPV is substantially higher when more research findings are statistically significant. Thus, a few positive replications can considerably enhance our confidence that the research findings reflect a true relationship. When R ranged from 0.0001 to 0.01, a higher number of positive studies is required to attain a reasonable PPV. The difference in PPV for power of 80% and power of 20% when at least three studies are positive is higher than when at least one study is positive. Figure 2 gives the PPV for increasing number of positive studies out of ten, 25, and 50 studies for pre-study odds of 0.0001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5 for powers of 20% and 80%. When there is at least one positive study (r = 1) and power equal to 80%, as indicated in Ioannidis’ paper, PPV declined approximately 50% for 50 studies compared to ten studies for R values between 0.0001 and 0.1. However, PPV increases with increasing number of positive studies and the percentage of positive studies required to achieve a given PPV declines with increasing number of studies. The number of positive studies required to achieve a PPV of at least 70% increased from eight for ten studies to 12 for 50 studies when pre-study odds equaled 0.0001, from five for ten studies to eight for 50 studies when pre-study odds equaled 0.01, from three for ten studies to six for 50 studies when pre-study odds equaled 0.1, and from two for ten studies to five for 50 studies when pre-study odds equaled 0.5. The difference in PPV for powers of 80% and 20% declines with increasing number of studies.

Go to: Probability Distribution of Statistically Significant Results Although the PPV increases with increasing statistically significant results, the probability of obtaining at least r significant results declines with increasing r. This probability and the corresponding PPV for pre-study odds of 0.0001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0.5 are given for ten studies in Table 2. When power is 20% and pre-study odds are 0.0001, the probability of obtaining at least three statistically significant results is 1% and the corresponding PPV is 0.3%. This probability and the corresponding PPV increase with increasing pre-study odds. For example, when R = 0.1, the probability of obtaining at least three significant results is 4% and the PPV is 74%. As expected, both the probability of obtaining statistically significant results and the corresponding PPV increase with increasing power. However, for very small R values (around 0.0001), the increase in power has a minimal impact in the probability of obtaining at least one, two, or three statistically significant results. When power is 80%, the probability of obtaining at least three statistically significant results is 1.2% and the corresponding PPV is 0.9% for R = 0.0001, and when pre-study odds are 0.1, the probability of obtaining at least three statistically significant results increases to 10% and the corresponding PPV to 90%.

The editor emphasized that when authors submit manuscripts reporting genetic associations, the study should include an effect size and it should contain either a replication in an independent sample or physiologically meaningful data supporting a functional role of the polymorphism in question. While we acknowledge that our assumptions of identical design, power, and level of significance reflect a somewhat simplified scenario of replication, we quantified the positive predictive value of true research findings for increasing numbers of significant results. True replication, however, requires a precise process where the exact same finding is reexamined in the same way. More often than not, genuine replication is not done, and what we end up with in the literature is corroboration or indirect supporting evidence. While this may be acceptable to some extent in any scientific enterprise, the distance from this to data dredging, moving the goal post, and other selective reporting biases is often very small and can contribute to “pseudo” replication. Replication does not mean that we can have underpowered studies; even when we have several underpowered studies replicate a finding, the PPV remains low. Good replication practices require adequately powered studies. More generally, meta-analysis is a more useful approach to assess the totality of evidence in a body of work. Ioannidis discussed the importance of meta-analysis, and its weaknesses in cases where even the meta-analysis is underpowered. Our calculations have not considered the possibility of bias, i.e., selective reporting problems that may change some “negative” results to “positive” or may leave “negative” results unpublished. John Ioannidis has shown that modest bias can decrease the PPV steeply [6]. Therefore if replication is to work in genuinely increasing the PPV of research claims, it should be coupled with full transparency and non-selective reporting of research results. Note that when hypotheses are one-sided, according to our definition of replication, we only consider hypotheses that are in the same direction. Under this definition, statistically significant results in both directions do not arise. However, in meta-analysis, one can combine results that are significant in opposite directions. Calculations in a formal meta-analysis may not square fully with the inference presented here, since meta-analysis would incorporate both effect sizes and their uncertainty rather than just the “positive” versus “negative” inference. For example, we may have the necessary number of “positive” studies, but if the observed “positive” effects are small and all the other studies have trends in the opposite direction, the summary effect may well be null. In summary, while we agree with Ioannidis that most research findings are false, we clearly demonstrate that replication of research findings enhances the positive predictive value of research findings being true. While this is not unexpected, it should be encouraging news to researchers in their never-ending pursuit of scientific hypothesis generation and testing. Nevertheless, more methodologic work is needed to assess and interpret cumulative evidence of research findings and their biological plausibility. This is especially urgent in the exploding field of genetic associations.

Traditional custodians – the guardians, curators, and upholders of knowledge – face the innovative, democratizing force of the internet, which shifts how knowledge is accessed, disseminated, and validated. This essay seeks to unravel the complexities surrounding this role within the Arts and Natural Sciences, assessing whether custodians are an anachronism or a requisite stabilizing force in an era of digital ubiquity. By delving deeply into real-life examples that illustrate the tension and interplay between established custodianship and the liberating potential of the internet, we will contemplate the overarching necessity for such guardianship in today’s digitalized context. # Arts: The Necessity of Contextual Custodianship The Arts stand as a testament to the human spirit's creative prowess, with custodians ensuring the contextual integrity imperative for understanding and categorizing art. A striking illustration arises from the events surrounding the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, when Lil Nas X's genre-blurring hit “Old Town Road,” received widespread recognition. Despite its accolades, perhaps most notable is its removal from Billboard’s country chart in March 2019, following its debut on the 16th of that month. Billboard's decision to reclassify the song as a rap track reflects the custodian’s traditional role in defining genre boundaries, therein impacting the song's audience and legacy. The act exposed the implicit biases and possibly racial exclusions within industry categorizations, proffering that custodians in the Arts possess significant power in shaping cultural and artistic narratives. This removed act by Billboard catalyzed significant backlash, epitomized by the \\"Yee Haw Challenge\\" on TikTok, which boosted the track's popularity independent of its genre classification. This user-driven movement directly challenged the notion of genre gatekeeping, suggesting that, perhaps, the community itself could assume the role of custodian, organically shaping and defining the cultural lexicon without traditional intermediaries. **Counterclaim**: Despite this challenge to traditional custodianship, history demonstrates that custodians have long played a significant role in legitimizing and shaping the Arts. The Salon des Refusés of 1863, when artists rejected by the Paris Salon, including Édouard Manet and James McNeill Whistler, exhibited their works in defiance of conservative artistic standards, serves as a historical counterpoint. The salon, sponsored by the French government and the Academy of Fine Arts, had served as the traditional custodian of acceptable art until Emperor Napoleon III ordered that the rejected artworks, including Manet's \\"Déjeuner sur l’herbe\\" and Whistler's \\"Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl\\", be displayed for public judgment. This public presentation ultimately contributed to the rise of the avant-garde and Impressionism, revealing how custodians can act as both gatekeepers and catalysts for evolution within the arts. # Natural Sciences: The Imperative for Scientific Custodianship The emergence of the replication crisis in the Natural Sciences spotlights the indispensable role of traditional custodians in maintaining scientific rigor. Since the term \\"replication crisis\\" was coined in the early 2010s, the scientific method's essential process – the reproducibility and validity of experimental results that form the foundation of empirical science – has been called into question. Wide-scale efforts in parsing through psychology and medical research have unveiled a disconcerting number of studies whose results elude replication or verification, thus undermining the trust in the empirical frameworks upon which scientific knowledge is built. **Counterclaim**: However, this crisis has ignited a dialogue about the future of scientific custodianship, wherein digital platforms are reframing the dynamics of knowledge validation. BioRxiv, a preprint server for biology founded in 2013, exemplifies the shifting landscape of custodianship from centralized gatekeeping to community-based, open-source evaluation. This platform allows researchers to share findings prior to peer review, possibly fostering more rapid scientific innovation and dialogue, challenging the exclusive custodianship model historically held by peer-reviewed journals. Despite the proliferation of independent verification through digital archives and open-access repositories that embolden scientific collaboration and transparency, the replication crisis reveals that the self-correcting mechanism of science cannot solely rely upon the collective scrutiny of the community. The rigor and formality associated with peer review and editorial oversight, although not impervious to error, establish a level of credibility that digital platforms alone struggle to guarantee unequivocally. # The Dichotomy of Custodianship in the Digital Age Navigating the dichotomy of custodianship in the digital age reveals a dual narrative: while the internet is perceived to obsolesce traditional gatekeepers, real-life examples from the Arts and Natural Sciences suggest that custodianship persists in refined forms. In the Arts, custodians maintain a critical role in how works are understood, categorized, and preserved, whereas in the Natural Sciences, custodians are central to endorsing the methodological integrity and empirical validity upon which the scientific enterprise rests. Despite the challenges introduced by digital means of knowledge dissemination, the custodian's role as a guarantor of quality, context, and credibility has not diminished; it has merely evolved. # Conclusion The exploration of real-life examples across different ages and areas of knowledge fortifies the assertion that custodians remain crucial, even indispensable, in ensuring the maintenance and integrity of knowledge despite, or even because of, the advent of the internet. Abstracting from the specifics of each domain, custodians serve as the arbiters of validity, excellence, and tradition. Far from becoming superfluous in the digital era, custodians are more necessary than ever, operating as a necessary bulwark against the tides of misinformation and foundational instability that can follow in the wake of open, borderless digital exchange. The custodian thus emerges not as a relic of a bygone era but as a beacon of trust, a navigator guiding the evolution of knowledge in tandem with technological innovation, and ultimately, a sentinel of enlightenment in an information-saturated world."},{"instruction":"как вывести время на форму при нажатии на кнопку в PyCharm","output":"В PyCharm вы можете использовать библиотеку Tkinter для создания графического интерфейса пользователя (GUI) и отображения времени на форме.

Output the full text after rewriting. Original paragraph: In conclusion, NVPF@rGO has been resoundingly synthesized by microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach with subsequent calcination treatment. Optimizing experimental conditions, NVPF@rGO consists of regular NVPF nanocuboid with sizes of 50-150 nm, evenly dispersing on the rGO sheets. When NVPF@rGO is used as a cathode for SIBs, a high reversible capacity of 123 mAh g-1 with a splendid initial Coulombic efficiency of 84% at 1 C can be obtained. NVPF@rGO also delivers a capacity of 116 mAh g-1 at the ultrahigh current rate of 50 C. At a high rate of 10 C, a stable capacity of 107 mAh g-1 with a high conservation ratio of 85.6% can be achieved after 7000 cycles. Moreover, NVPF@rGO//HC full battery also reveals good properties. In the presence of rGO, faster Na+ diffusion behavior, smaller resistance, and higher pseudocapacitance can be obtained for NVPF@rGO, which are responsible for the preeminent electrochemical properties. The ultrastable rate and cycling performance are also attributed to small lattice change and high structural reversibility during the electrochemical process verified by in situ XRD. Hence, NVPF@rGO is a very hopeful cathode material with high voltage, high rate, and ultralong longevity for fast-charging SIBs.","output":"In conclusion, the synthesis of NVPF@rGO using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach followed by calcination treatment has been successfully achieved. By optimizing the experimental conditions, the resulting NVPF@rGO composite exhibits uniform dispersion of regular NVPF nanocuboids ranging in size from 50 to 150 nm on the rGO sheets. When employed as a cathode material for SIBs, NVPF@rGO demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance. Specifically, it delivers a high reversible capacity of 123 mAh g-1 at 1 C, accompanied by an impressive initial Coulombic efficiency of 84%. Notably, even at an ultrahigh current rate of 50 C, NVPF@rGO maintains a capacity of 116 mAh g-1.

Furthermore, when applied in a NVPF@rGO//HC full battery configuration, the composite exhibits favorable properties. The presence of rGO facilitates faster Na+ diffusion, reduces resistance, and enhances pseudocapacitance in NVPF@rGO. These factors contribute to its superior electrochemical properties. The exceptional rate capability and cycling stability can be attributed to the minimal lattice changes and high structural reversibility of NVPF@rGO during the electrochemical process, as confirmed by in situ XRD analysis. Consequently, NVPF@rGO displays promising characteristics as a cathode material for fast-charging SIBs, offering high voltage, high rate capability, and exceptional long-term durability."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It could be the name of a character in a story or game. In this context, it is likely being used as the name of a person speaking the dialogue. - 「...」: Japanese quotation marks. They are used to indicate that what is inside them is spoken or thought by a character (in this case, Papasu). - わっはっは (wahhahha): This is an onomatopoeic expression representing laughter. It could be translated to \\"hahaha\\" or \\"boisterous laughter\\" in English. Here, it's used to convey that Papasu is laughing loudly or in a hearty manner. - 寝ぼけている (nebokete iru): This is a verb phrase. 寝ぼける (nebokeru) means \\"to be half asleep\\" or \\"to be drowsy,\\" often implying that someone is not fully awake and potentially confused or disoriented. The ている (te iru) form indicates a continuous or current state of being; so, 寝ぼけている means \\"is drowsy\\" or \\"is half asleep\\" or \\"is groggy.\\" - な (na): This is a sentence-ending particle that, in this context, is used to show emotion or emphasis. It adds a nuance of light exclamation or mild surprise, similar to saying \\"aren't you?\\" or \\"you are, aren't you?\\" in English. Put together, パパス「わっはっは! 寝ぼけているな。」can be translated as \\"Papas: 'Hahaha!

Used with 眠気ざまし, it means \\"for the purpose of waking up\\" or \\"to dispel sleepiness.\\" - 外 (soto): This means \\"outside.\\" - にでも (ni demo): This construction combines the particle に (indicating a direction or destination) with でも (which can mean \\"or something\\" or \\"for example\\"). Together, they imply a non-specific, somewhat casual suggestion, akin to \\"why not go outside or somewhere?\\" - 行って (itte): This is the te-form of the verb 行く (iku, \\"to go\\"). It is used to connect sequential actions, similar to the English \\"and then.\\" So in this context, \\"go and...\\" - 風に (kaze ni): 風 (kaze) means \\"wind,\\" and the particle に indicates receiving action, so 風に literally means \\"to the/because of the wind,\\" as in an action related to the wind, such as \\"catch the wind\\" or \\"be in the wind.\\" - あたって (atatte): This is the te-form of the verb 当たる (ataru), which can mean \\"to be hit by\\" or \\"to be exposed to.\\" In this context, it refers to \\"exposing oneself to\\" or \\"feeling\\" the wind. - 来たら (kitara): This is the conditional form of the verb 来る (kuru, \\"to come\\"). It implies \\"if you come\\" or \\"when you come.\\" So, when added to the previous verb あたって, it means \\"if/when you have felt the wind.\\" - どうだ (dou da): This is a colloquial way of making a suggestion or asking for an opinion. どう means \\"how\\" or \\"what about,\\" and だ is the casual affirmative verb similar to \\"is.\\" So, どうだ by itself can be understood as \\"How about it?\\" Therefore, the full sentence パパス「眠気ざましに外にでも行って風にあたって来たらどうだ。」translates to \\"Papas: 'How about going outside to wake yourself up and catching some wind?'\\" or \\"Papas: 'Why don't you go outside to clear your drowsiness and let the wind blow on you?'\\" Papasu is suggesting that going outside and experiencing the wind might be an effective way to become more alert."},{"instruction":"Explain grammatically *「ほんとうに かわいい たまのような男の子で!","output":"The Japanese phrase 「ほんとうに かわいい たまのような男の子で!」can be analyzed grammatically as follows: - 「...」: Japanese quotation marks, signaling that the sentence is a quote, spoken utterance, or thought. - ほんとうに (hontou ni): This is an adverb meaning \\"truly\\" or \\"really.\\" The に (ni) particle here turns the word ほんとう (hontou), which on its own means \\"truth\\" or \\"reality,\\" into an adverb, so it modifies the adjective that follows, which is かわいい (cute). - かわいい (kawaii): This is an i-adjective meaning \\"cute\\" or \\"adorable.\\" It directly describes the noun that comes right after it. - たまのような (tama no you na): This is a simile construction. - たま (tama) means \\"ball\\" or \\"sphere.\\" It can also mean \\"gem\\" or \\"jewel\\" depending on context. - のような (no you na) is a phrase that means \\"like\\" or \\"similar to.\\" The の (no) is a possessive/associative particle linking たま (tama) to よう (you), which means \\"appearance\\" or \\"manner.\\" Together, のよう (no you) means \\"like\\" or \\"as though.\\" な (na) is a copulative particle used here to adjectivize のよう (no you), allowing it to directly modify the following noun. - 男の子 (otoko no ko): This noun phrase means \\"boy\\" or \\"young male child.\\" It combines 男 (otoko, meaning \\"male\\" or \\"man\\") and の (no, which indicates possession or association) with 子 (ko, meaning \\"child\\"). - で (de): This particle has several functions, but in this case, it's most likely the te-form of the copula だ (da), which means \\"is.\\" The te-form can indicate the reason for something or be used to connect sentences, similar to \\"and\\" or \\"so\\" in English. The exclamation at the end implies that the sentence is cut off or trails off, leaving the overall meaning or consequence of the cuteness unspecified. Putting it all together, the phrase 「ほんとうに かわいい たまのような男の子で!」translates to \\"He is really such a cute boy, like a gem!\\" The speaker is emphasizing the boy's cuteness by comparing him to something precious like a ball or jewel, and the use of an exclamation mark indicates strong emotion or excitement about this. The trailing off particle で suggests that the speaker is so moved or smitten that they don't finish their sentence or the thought is continued from previous context."},{"instruction":"Dime cuál es el propósito de la lectura comprensiva","output":"El propósito de la lectura comprensiva (también conocida como lectura comprensiva) es permitir que el lector no solo descifre las palabras y frases del texto, sino que también entienda su significado completo y las ideas que el autor quiere comunicar.

Let's break it down: - 「ほんとうに」(hontō ni) – Truly, really. It comes from the noun \\"本当\\" (hontou) which means \\"truth\\", combined with the \\"に\\" (ni) adverbial particle to make it mean \\"truly\\" or \\"really\\" as an adverb. - 「かわいい」(kawaii) – Cute or adorable. It's an i-adjective that directly modifies nouns to mean \\"cute\\". - 「たまのような」(tama no yō na) – Like a ball or jewel (tama can mean ball, jewel, or gem depending on context). 「たま」(tama) is \\"ball\\" or \\"jewel\\" and 「のような」(no yō na) is a phrase that means \\"like\\" or \\"similar to\\", composed of the possessive particle 「の」(no) and the phrase 「ような」(yō na) which is a form of 「よう」meaning \\"appearance\\" or \\"manner\\". Together they make a comparative \\"like a ~\\" or \\"resembling ~\\". - 「男の子で」(otoko no ko de) – Boy (with a particle). 「男の子」(otoko no ko) means \\"boy\\", made up of 「男」(otoko) meaning \\"man\\" or \\"male\\", and 「の子」(no ko) meaning \\"child\\". The particle 「で」(de) is a little complex here because it can have various functions in Japanese.

Voici quelques-unes de ses thèses principales dans la philosophie : 1. Monades : Leibniz est célèbre pour sa théorie des monades. Il considérait l'univers composé d'entités ultimes, indivisibles et immatérielles appelées monades. Chaque monade est une unité dynamique avec des qualités intrinsèques qui reflètent l'univers entier à sa manière unique. Les monades n’ont pas de fenêtres et ne peuvent pas interagir physiquement, mais sont coordonnées harmonieusement par Dieu. 2. Harmonie préétablie : Cette théorie est liée à celle des monades. Puisque les monades ne peuvent pas interagir, Leibniz propose que toutes leurs actions soient coordonnées à l'avance par Dieu de manière à ce qu'elles soient en harmonie les unes avec les autres. Cela s'applique notamment à l'interaction supposée entre les monades corporelles et les monades de l'âme ou de l'esprit. 3. Principe de raison suffisante : Leibniz affirmait que pour chaque fait, il doit y avoir une raison suffisante qui explique pourquoi ce fait est ainsi et non autrement. Cela signifie que rien dans l'univers n'arrive sans une cause ou une explication logique. 4. Optimisme théologique : Leibniz est souvent cité pour sa phrase « Nous vivons dans le meilleur des mondes possibles ». Cette vue, qui a été critiquée par des philosophes comme Voltaire, découle de sa croyance en un Dieu parfait qui a choisi le meilleur système possible avec les meilleures lois de la nature possibles. 5. Calcul infinitésimal : Sur le plan mathématique, bien que cela ne soit pas en soi une \\"thèse\\" philosophique, Leibniz a développé indépendamment (et presque simultanément avec Sir Isaac Newton) le calcul infinitésimal. Il a introduit plusieurs notations utilisées encore aujourd'hui, comme le symbole d’intégration ∫. 6. Identité des indiscernables : Cette thèse affirme que s'il n'y a aucune façon de distinguer deux entités par leurs propriétés, alors elles sont en fait une seule et même entité. Autrement dit, deux objets distincts doivent différer par quelque propriété. 7. Continuité et changement: Leibniz a soutenu le principe de continuité selon lequel les processus naturels se déroulent dans une séquence continue sans sauts ou ruptures abruptes. De plus, il a développé des idées sur la transformation et le changement qui ont préfiguré les concepts de la philosophie moderne et de la dynamique des systèmes. 8. Théodicée : Dans ses essais sur la théodicée (justification de la bonté de Dieu face à l'existence du mal), Leibniz a tenté de résoudre le problème du mal en soutenant que le mal est nécessaire pour le meilleur des mondes possibles, car il contribue à un plus grand bien. Leibniz était un penseur extrêmement complexe, et ses idées ont influencé de nombreux domaines. La compréhension des thèses de Leibniz nécessite souvent une étude détaillée de ses écrits, notamment ses œuvres philosophiques, mathématiques et théologiques."},{"instruction":"développe son premier argument","output":"Le premier argument majeur de Leibniz concerne sa théorie des monades. Pour comprendre cette théorie, il est nécessaire de plonger dans la métaphysique de Leibniz, qui cherche à expliquer la nature fondamentale de la réalité. **Les Monades :** Une monade, selon Leibniz, est une substance simple, c'est-à-dire sans parties. Les monades sont les éléments de base de l'univers et peuvent être comprises comme des entités métaphysiques qui sont à la fois vivantes et dynamiques. Elles possèdent une sorte de perception et d’appétition, ce qui signifie qu’elles ont la capacité de percevoir les États d’autres monades (bien que d'une manière non physique) et de tendre vers des états futurs. Chaque monade est unique et contient en elle des perceptions qui reflètent l'univers entier à partir de son propre point de vue. En d'autres termes, bien que les monades ne puissent pas interagir physiquement ou être influencées directement par d'autres monades, elles sont comme des miroirs vivants de l'univers, reflétant les changements qui se produisent ailleurs selon leur propre perspective. **Les attributs clés d'une monade incluent :** 1. **Unité** : La monade est indivisible et, en tant que substance simple, elle ne peut être décomposée en parties. 2. **Individuation** : Chaque monade est caractérisée par ses perceptions internes, qui la rendent distincte de toutes les autres monades. 3. **Inséparabilité** : Une monade ne peut être influencée par rien d'extérieur à elle-même; elle ne subit aucune altération physique de l'extérieur. 4. **Intériorité** : Les états d’une monade, y compris ses changements, proviennent de son intérieur, en fonction de ses perceptions et de son appétit. Leibniz s'est servi de l'analogie de l'horloge pour illustrer l'harmonie préétablie entre les monades : deux horloges parfaitement synchronisées pourraient sembler interagir l’une avec l’autre en raison de la précision de leur synchronisation, mais en réalité, elles fonctionnent de manière indépendante, ayant été préalablement réglées par un horloger (Dieu). Le concept de monade est la pierre angulaire de la philosophie de Leibniz et sert à éviter les problèmes posés par l'interaction entre l’esprit et la matière que l'on trouve dans la philosophie cartésienne. En définissant un univers composé de substances non matérielles et auto-suffisantes, Leibniz crée un cadre métaphysique dans lequel les lois de la nature et la causalité sont mises en œuvre par l'ordonnancement préétabli de Dieu, ce qui garantit le fonctionnement cohérent et harmonieux de tout."},{"instruction":"Mais du coup, un être humain est t il composé de nomades ? En quoi est il intéressant d'intégrer ce concept de nomade ?","output":"Je tiens à clarifier qu'il semble y avoir une petite confusion dans votre question : vous avez mentionné le terme \\"nomade\\" au lieu de \\"monade\\", qui est le concept clé dans la philosophie de Leibniz. Je vais donc répondre en supposant que vous faisiez référence aux monades. **Un Être Humain et les Monades :** Oui, selon Leibniz, un être humain est composé de monades. En fait, tout dans l'univers, qu'il s'agisse d'entités physiques ou abstraites, est composé de ces unités élémentaires et immatérielles. Pour Leibniz, une monade \\"dominante\\" constitue l'âme ou l'esprit d’un être humain, tandis que les monades subordonnées correspondent aux différentes fonctions et parties du corps. Ainsi, l'âme est vue comme une monade spéciale qui reflète l'univers de manière encore plus claire et plus distinctive que les monades inférieures. **Intérêt du Concept de Monade :** 1. **Résolution de la relation corps-esprit :** Chez Descartes, la relation entre le monde matériel (le corps) et le monde immatériel (l'esprit) pose problème en raison de leur distinction absolue (le dualisme cartésien). À travers la notion de monades et de l'harmonie préétablie, Leibniz propose un système où cette interaction est coordonnée non pas par des liens causaux directs, mais par la volonté préalable de Dieu. 2. **Réconciliation entre le déterminisme et la liberté :** Puisque chaque monade opère selon des principes internes, Leibniz soutient que les actions d'une monade sont à la fois déterminées (par sa nature) et libres (puisqu'elles ne sont pas contraintes par des influences externes). 3. **Métaphysique de la simplicité :** Les monades sont des substances simples qui ne peuvent pas être détruites par des moyens naturels, ce qui offre une vision de l'univers comme composé d'entités indépendantes qui sont éternelles et inaltérables dans leur essence. 4. **Réflexion de la complexité :** Chaque monade est un microcosme de l'univers entier, reflétant la complexité de celui-ci dans une unité simple. Cela permet une vision holistique de la réalité où tout est interconnecté de manière significative, même si les connexions ne sont pas physiquement directes. 5. **Fondation pour un système optimiste :** Le concept de monades permet à Leibniz de soutenir que nous vivons dans le meilleur des mondes possibles. Chaque monade joue son rôle défini dans un vaste plan cosmique, qui est finalement ordonné vers le bien, selon la conception parfaite de Dieu. En bref, l’introduction du concept de monade par Leibniz propose une alternative unique pour aborder plusieurs problèmes classiques de la métaphysique et de la théologie, en offrant un cadre unifié pour comprendre la diversité de l'existence, tout en affirmant une harmonie sous-jacente et un ordre préétabli dans le monde."},{"instruction":"Par conséquent, était il animiste ?","output":"Non, Leibniz n'était pas animiste dans le sens que nous donnons généralement à ce terme. L'animisme est la croyance que des objets naturels, des phénomènes, voire l'univers lui-même, possèdent une âme ou un esprit. Il est souvent associé à des religions et des cultures qui croient que des esprits animent la nature, comme dans certaines sociétés traditionnelles et des cultures indigènes. La philosophie de Leibniz, d'autre part, est plus métaphysique et systématique. Dans sa théorie des monades, chaque monade est une entité métaphysique simple et sans matière avec des capacités de perception et d'action interne (telles que des changements dans ses états de perception). Les monades ne sont pas considérées comme des esprits ou des âmes animant des objets physiques, mais plutôt comme les véritables unités fondamentales de la réalité. Les monades chez Leibniz reflètent une vision très organisée et hiérarchisée de l'univers, où tout s'interconnecte en termes de représentations internes et d'une harmonie préétablie, plutôt que par des interactions physiques. Cela est particulièrement éloigné de l'animisme traditionnel qui implique souvent des rituels et des croyances spécifiques liés à l'interaction avec ces esprits. Cependant, la vision de Leibniz qu'il existe un certain type de vie ou de force vitale dans l'univers peut sembler superficiellement similaire à l'animisme car les monades sont en quelque sorte \\"animées\\" (du latin \\"anima\\" signifiant âme ou esprit) en ayant des qualités qui sont analogues à la perception et au désir. Mais encore une fois, cette analogie est plus métaphorique et fait partie d'un cadre philosophique et théologique beaucoup plus abstrait. En bref, bien que Leibniz attribue des qualités semblables à celles d'une âme ou d'un esprit aux monades, il ne peut pas être qualifié d'animiste dans le sens traditionnel ou religieux du terme. Son système est un effort pour rendre compte de la complexité de l'expérience et de l'organisation du monde d'une manière cohérente avec sa croyance en un Dieu rationnel et parfait."},{"instruction":"En quoi pour Descartes, la relation entre le monde matériel (le corps) et le monde immatériel (l’esprit) pose t il problème ?","output":"René Descartes (1596-1650), philosophe, mathématicien et scientifique français, est souvent crédité pour avoir posé les bases de la philosophie moderne. Parmi ses contributions philosophiques les plus notables se trouve la formulation du dualisme cartésien, qui distingue radicalement entre res cogitans (la chose qui pense, ou l'esprit) et res extensa (la chose étendue, ou le corps/matériel). Voici les problèmes fondamentaux posés par cette distinction : 1. **Interactionnisme :** Si l'esprit et le corps sont des substances totalement différentes et séparées (l'un étant immatériel et pensant, l'autre matériel et non pensant), comment peuvent-ils interagir entre eux? En d'autres termes, comment nos pensées (esprit) peuvent avoir une influence sur nos actions physiques (corps), et comment les stimuli physiques (corps) peuvent affecter notre expérience consciente (esprit) ? Descartes lui-même ne fournit pas d'explication pleinement satisfaisante à ce qu'on appelle \\"le problème de l'interaction corps-esprit​\\". 2. **Localisation de l'esprit :** Descartes a suggéré que l'esprit interagit avec la matière (en particulier avec le corps humain) à travers la glande pinéale, mais cela n’est pas convenu avec les connaissances neurophysiologiques qui ont suivi, et le mécanisme précis de cette interaction est resté non élucidé dans son système. 3. **Causalité :** Le principe de causalité, l'un des piliers de la science, suggère que chaque effet doit avoir une cause adéquate. Si l'esprit et le corps sont de substances différentes, alors la capacité de l'esprit à causer des changements dans le corps (et vice versa) défie le principe selon lequel les causes doivent être proportionnelles à leurs effets. 4. **Statut ontologique :** Le dualisme de Descartes élève des questions sur la réalité ontologique de l'esprit et du corps. Si l'esprit est indépendant de la matière, quel est son statut existentiel ? Comment pouvons-nous attribuer l'existence réelle à quelque chose de non physique ? En réaction à ces problèmes, d'autres philosophes ont proposé différentes conceptions de la relation entre l'esprit et la matière. Par exemple, Spinoza a rejeté le dualisme pour l'idée que l'esprit et la matière sont deux attributs de la même substance. Leibniz, comme expliqué précédemment, a introduit la théorie des monades et de l'harmonie préétablie pour contourner le problème d'interaction. La relation entre le monde matériel et le monde immatériel reste un sujet complexe et débattu dans la philosophie de l'esprit et en métaphysique, révélant les défis inhérents à la compréhension de la conscience et du rôle de l'esprit dans un univers physique."},{"instruction":"Réexplique l'argument de causalité. Quel est le problème implicite ?","output":"L'argument de la causalité, en ce qui concerne les problèmes soulevés par le dualisme cartésien, se centre sur la question de savoir comment deux substances aussi fondamentalement différentes comme l'esprit (res cogitans) et le corps (res extensa) peuvent avoir une quelconque forme d'interaction causale. Selon Descartes, l'esprit est une substance immatérielle ne possédant pas d'extension spatiale, et le corps est une substance matérielle qui existe dans l'espace et est soumise aux lois physiques. La causalité, dans le monde physique, implique souvent le transfert de l'énergie ou le déplacement de la matière de cause à effet. Dans le cas du dualisme, nous sommes confrontés aux problèmes suivants : 1. **Comment la non-étendue agit sur l'étendue ?** Si l'esprit est immatériel et n'est pas soumis aux lois de la physique, selon le modèle classique de causalité, il est difficile de concevoir comment il pourrait influencer les processus matériels (par exemple, faire bouger un bras ou ressentir la douleur d'une coupure), car il n'y aurait pas de moyen apparent pour l'énergie ou la force de se transférer entre eux. 2. **Problème de proportionnalité :** En philosophie, le principe de proportionnalité dans la causalité stipule que la cause doit être suffisante pour produire son effet. Si l'esprit et le corps sont si différents, comment un esprit non-physique peut-il produire un effet dans le monde physique de manière à respecter ce principe ? 3. **Absence de mécanisme explicatif :** Descartes ne parvient pas à expliquer de manière convaincante le mécanisme par lequel l'esprit peut avoir une action causale sur le corps, et vice versa. Sa proposition que la glande pinéale serait le site de l'interaction n'offre pas de mécanisme plausible à l'éclairage des découvertes ultérieures en neurosciences. Le problème implicite ici est que s'il existe une forme de causalité entre l'esprit et le corps, elle doit être radicalement différente de notre conception conventionnelle de causalité, qui est physique. Cela ouvre la porte à de nombreuses interrogations complexes sur la nature de l'esprit, du libre arbitre, et sur la façon dont nous pouvons connaître et comprendre le monde immatériel à travers les outils et les concepts du monde matériel. Les philosophes postérieurs ont proposé diverses solutions à ce problème. Par exemple, des philosophes comme Baruch Spinoza ont contourné le problème en rejetant le dualisme au profit d'un monisme où l'esprit et le corps sont des aspects ou des attributs d'une seule et même substance. D'autres, comme Leibniz, ont proposé des modèles métaphysiques complexes comme sa théorie des monades, où l'interaction entre l'esprit et le corps est remplacée par des réalités non physiques orchestrées dans une harmonie préétablie par Dieu. Cela évitait le problème de l'interaction directe entre substances différentes en affirmant que chaque monade fonctionne de manière indépendante, mais de manière conforme à un plan divin global."},{"instruction":"Previous ChatGPT instance: When on an (initramfs) prompt (in Debian), how can one tell initramfs or whatever it is to boot from a specified drive?

It occurs when the electrical impulses that control the heart's rhythm originate in the AV node instead of the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is the normal pacemaker of the heart. On an electrocardiogram (ECG), a junctional dysrhythmia appears as a series of abnormal P waves or the absence of P waves, as the electrical signals are not consistently originating from the SA node. Instead, the P wave may be inverted, occur after the QRS complex (retrograde P wave), or be hidden within the QRS complex, making it difficult to identify. The QRS complex in a junctional dysrhythmia is typically narrow (<0.12 seconds), as the electrical impulses are conducted through the normal pathway from the AV node to the ventricles. The PR interval, which represents the time between the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, is either shortened or absent, as the electrical signals bypass the normal delay at the AV node. The heart rate in a junctional dysrhythmia can vary, but it is usually between 40 and 60 beats per minute. It may be regular or irregular, depending on the underlying rhythm disturbance. Overall, a junctional dysrhythmia on an ECG is characterized by abnormal P wave morphology, a narrow QRS complex, variable heart rate, and absent or shortened PR interval. It is important to evaluate the clinical context and symptoms of the individual to determine the significance and appropriate management of the dysrhythmia."},{"instruction":"Discrepancy","output":"Discrepancy refers to a difference or inconsistency between two or more things.

In an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts, the Wordgirl villains were gathered, plotting their next devious scheme. Among them were the mischievous trio of Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, The Butcher, and The Whammer, all known for their cunning plans and relentless pursuit of chaos. As they exchanged witty banter and brainstormed ideas, a peculiar figure caught their attention. A young girl, with porcelain-white skin and large button-like eyes, stood silently at the entrance of the warehouse. Her plain dress and vacant expression made her seem out of place in their villainous hideout. Chuck, always quick to notice the unusual, was the first to react. \\"Uh, guys, who invited this creepy doll-faced girl? She's giving me the heebie-jeebies!\\" The Butcher, never one to be startled easily, eyed the girl suspiciously. \\"Hmm, she looks like she walked straight out of a horror movie. I don't trust her.\\" Whammer, however, tilted his head and squinted his eyes, genuinely intrigued by the girl's presence. \\"She doesn't look so bad. Maybe she just wants to play with us. She doesn't need words to have fun!\\" The other villains exchanged doubtful glances but couldn't resist the urge to investigate further. As the girl approached, her button eyes gleamed with curiosity. With a simple nod, she motioned for them to join her in a circle, as if inviting them to play a game. The villains hesitated at first, but Whammer's enthusiasm was infectious. He bounded forward, clapping his hands together, ready for whatever game the mysterious girl had in mind. The others reluctantly followed suit. Suddenly, the girl produced a red rubber ball from her gown and tossed it toward Whammer. Catching it effortlessly, he grinned and tossed it back to her. The game had begun! Round after round, the villains found themselves laughing and reveling in the carefree nature of the girl. Her silence was comforting, almost like a peaceful respite from their usual scheming. They discovered a carefree side of themselves they had forgotten. Chuck, who began the game with hesitation, giggled as he juggled the ball between his hands. The Butcher, usually gruff and stern, showed a rare smile as he caught the ball, releasing it with a hearty chuckle. And Whammer, who had always been misunderstood and seeking acceptance, found solace in the innocent joy their new friend exuded. The game continued well into the night, the abandoned warehouse reverberating with laughter and the sound of bouncing rubber. The girl, with her button eyes sparkling, seemed to grow more alive with every moment. As the moon rose high in the sky, casting long shadows across the room, the villains realized that despite her unusual appearance, the girl was no threat to their villainous ways. She was a reminder of purity, simplicity, and the importance of embracing playfulness amidst the chaos. Wordgirl herself would never have expected her villains to discover such happiness from an unexpected source. But even as a hero, she understood that everyone deserved a chance for change, even the most notorious rogues. And so, the villains and the button-eyed girl continued to play, united in the shared joy of their newfound bond. It didn't matter that she couldn't speak - her silent presence spoke volumes, reminding them all of the power of friendship and the ability to find happiness in the most unexpected places."},{"instruction":"Whammer nicknames the little girl Buttons because of her eyes, and Buttons stays close to Whammer, as though they're brother and sister.

One day, as the villains took a break from their playtime, Chuck noticed Whammer's deep affection for the girl and chuckled mischievously. \\"Hey, Whammer, seems like you've found yourself quite a little sister there! You and Buttons are like two peas in a pod!\\" Whammer paused and looked at Chuck with a puzzled expression. \\"Little sister? What do you mean?\\" The Butcher chimed in, suppressing a smirk. \\"Oh, come on, Whammer! Can't you see the connection? You and Buttons have been inseparable ever since she arrived. It's like you're her big brother!\\" Whammer's eyes widened as realization dawned upon him. He glanced at Buttons, who was quietly observing them, and a warm feeling spread through his heart. He had indeed developed a sibling-like bond with her, without even realizing it. A mixture of surprise and delight washed over Whammer's face. \\"I... I never thought about that, but you guys might be right. Buttons... she feels like a sister to me. Someone I need to protect and take care of.\\" The other villains grinned, satisfied with their observation. \\"Well, Whammer, you've found your partner in crime, or should we say, partner in play? You make quite the duo!\\" Chuck joked. From that point forward, Whammer embraced his role as \\"Big Wham\\" to little Buttons. He would watch over her every move, making sure she was safe and included. Buttons, in return, seemed to understand the unspoken connection, finding comfort in Whammer's presence. Together, they would explore the nooks and crannies of Fair City, embarking on secret adventures only they understood. As they played, laughter echoed through the streets, surprising the citizens who had come to fear the villains. It seemed even the most unlikely friendships could bring about joy and happiness. Wordgirl, always keeping a watchful eye on the city, eventually discovered the villains' newfound bond with Buttons. Instead of intervening, she decided to let them enjoy their innocent companionship. After all, even villains needed a little light in their lives. And so, Whammer and Buttons continued to play, weaving their own unique story in the tapestry of Fair City. Their love for each other became an inspiring testament to the power of connection and how true friendships could be found even in the most unexpected places.

In an instant, Buttons transformed from a seemingly innocent girl into a haunting figure, her button eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. Her simple gown appeared more spectral, and an aura of darkness emanated from her. The security guards, caught off guard by this sudden transformation, were petrified with fear. Whammer, fueled by his penchant for chaos and mayhem, found this turn of events absolutely hilarious. He couldn't help but burst into uncontrollable laughter as the guards stumbled backward, dropping their radios and batons in a frenzy. Chuck and The Butcher, on the other hand, exchanged uneasy glances. They had grown accustomed to Buttons' innocent demeanor and were taken aback by her ability to switch so effortlessly from cute to creepy. It reminded them that there was more to this button-eyed girl than met the eye. As the guards trembled and scrambled for an escape, Buttons played her part perfectly. She would glide towards them with an eerie grace, her button eyes fixed on their trembling forms. Whammer, following behind her, would mimic her movements in an exaggerated and comically exaggerated manner, further intensifying the unsettling atmosphere. The other villains couldn't help but marvel at the unstoppable duo. Buttons and Whammer were unknowingly becoming the stuff of nightmares for the museum staff, leaving everyone intimidated and terrified. At the same time, their heist was progressing smoothly, as the villains took advantage of the chaos to snatch priceless artifacts without resistance. Chuck couldn't hide his unease any longer. \\"Buttons, Whammer... this is just too much! You two are scarier than any of the traps or security systems in this place! Can't you tone it down a little?\\" Whammer, still chuckling, turned to Chuck with a mischievous glint in his eyes. \\"Aw, c'mon, Chuck! It's all in good fun. Plus, it helps the team by keeping those guards off our backs. Isn't it great?\\" Reluctantly, the others had to admit that Whammer had a point. Buttons and Whammer's ability to strike fear into the hearts of guards proved to be a valuable asset during the heist. Though they were slightly creeped out by the notion of Buttons switching between adorable and ominous, they couldn't deny the effectiveness of their tactics. As the villains made their exit from the museum, their bags full of stolen treasures, they couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of their escapades. Buttons, back to her innocent appearance, smiled, grateful for the camaraderie she had found among the villains. In the end, the heist was a success, thanks in part to Buttons and Whammer's ability to terrify the security guards. They proved that even the most unsettling qualities could be an advantage when harnessed in the pursuit of mischief. And as the villains retreated into the night, ready for their next adventure, the memory of Buttons' ominous transformation would forever be etched in their minds, leaving a fascinating mix of fear and amusement in their villainous hearts."},{"instruction":"When they get back to the warehouse, after the successful heist, Whammer sings Buttons an eerie lullaby. Despite how slightly spooky it sounds, Buttons seems to really like it and falls asleep, her button eyes nonblinking yet her little snoring indicating how she was sleeping.","output":"After the successful heist, the villains returned to their beloved warehouse, their bags filled with the spoils of their mischievous endeavor. The adrenaline slowly dissipated, and a sense of accomplishment filled the air. As they settled in, Whammer, still chuckling to himself, noticed that Buttons looked exhausted from all the excitement. Approaching Buttons with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes, Whammer decided to perform an eerie lullaby he had heard in an old horror movie. The haunting melody carried through the air, filling the warehouse with its ghostly notes. Despite its slightly spooky tone, Buttons's button eyes remained fixated on Whammer, her curiosity piqued. As Whammer's voice blended with the whispers of the eerie lullaby, Buttons' eyelids grew heavier. The unsettling melody seemed to have a strange effect on her, one that transcended her appearance. Her tiny frame swayed gently as she succumbed to the hypnotic melody. Whammer, captivated by the scene, continued to sing, his voice soft and haunting. The other villains watched in awe and slight unease as Buttons slowly closed her button eyes, her tiny form finally relaxing. A delicate snore escaped her lips, accompanied by the soft sound of her breathing. Whammer, his voice hushed, finished the lullaby and gazed down at Buttons, his heart warmed by the sight. Despite the initially spooky tone of the lullaby, it seemed to have brought her comfort. He marveled at the serenity that washed over the once-mischievous girl. The Butcher, his arms crossed tightly, shifted uncomfortably. \\"Whammer, that lullaby was... well, creepy. But I guess if Buttons liked it and it helped her fall asleep, then it's alright.\\" Chuck, still astounded by the sight, chimed in, \\"Yeah, Wham, I gotta say, it's strange how something so eerie can be so soothing to that little doll-face. Guess we're all just learning more about our button-eyed friend every day!\\" Whammer, his voice filled with affection, whispered, \\"She's one strange gal, no doubt about it, but there's something special about her. Buttons lives in her own unique world, and I'm happy to be a part of it, even if it means singing eerie lullabies and tucking her in.\\" The villains, all slightly intrigued and slightly creeped out, nodded in agreement. They had grown to appreciate the whimsical and enigmatic presence of Buttons, finding her peculiar but endearing. And as the warehouse became enveloped in a tranquil silence, the villains took solace in the fact that, even amidst their chaotic lives, they could find moments of serenity, even if they were tinged with an eerie charm. With Buttons peacefully sleeping, her little snores resonating throughout the warehouse, the villains settled in for the night, knowing that however unusual their journey may be, they had discovered a unique connection—one that transcended appearances and traditions. And as Whammer quietly hummed the haunting lullaby to himself, he couldn't help but feel a sense of belonging and love emanating from the silent girl with the button eyes."},{"instruction":"Deep in the night, Wordgirl accidentally enters the warehouse and comes face to face with Buttons, who woke up to get a drink.

With her heightened senses, she knew something was amiss, but she couldn't pinpoint the source. As she stealthily moved through the shadows, her eyes caught a glimmer of light. She followed it cautiously, stepping into a dimly lit area. There, she came face to face with Buttons, who had awakened from her slumber and ventured out to quench her thirst. Buttons, in the quiet of the night, noticed Wordgirl's unexpected presence. The button-eyed girl's expression subtly shifted from innocent to haunting with her eerie blink. Her ghostly dress seemed to transform into something ethereal, resonating with an otherworldly aura. Wordgirl, taken aback by Buttons' sudden transformation, hesitated. She recognized the familiar faces of the other villains, but this small, silent stranger with her button eyes both intrigued and unnerved her. With caution in her voice, she spoke, \\"Who... or what are you?\\" Buttons, her button eyes gleaming with an inexplicable allure, decided to use her chilling appearance to her advantage. Without uttering a word, she drifted closer to Wordgirl, her figure taking on an almost ghostly quality. Her movements possessed an uncanny grace. Just as Wordgirl was about to inquire further, Buttons unleashed her eerie presence, the air around her chilling with malice. Wordgirl shuddered involuntarily, her superhuman instincts momentarily overwhelmed by the inexplicable aura. The sight before her emanated an energy entirely foreign to her realm of villains and heroes. Recognizing the dominance of her imposing presence, Wordgirl reluctantly retreated, knowing that this particular encounter required further investigation at a later time. She vowed to understand the complexities that lay behind the button-eyed girl's haunting facade. Satisfied with her ability to ward off Wordgirl, Buttons allowed her ethereal aura to dissipate. Returning to her innocent appearance once more, she calmly made her way back to her slumber, settling comfortably in her cozy corner of the warehouse. The events of the encounter seemed to fade away, her button eyes remaining steadfast and nonblinking. As Wordgirl retreated from the warehouse, her mind raced with questions. She couldn't shake the feeling that Buttons possessed more than meets the eye. Deep in her superhero instincts, she sensed the presence of a complex history behind the enigmatic girl's eerie facade. The next day, Wordgirl made a pledge to unravel the mystery of Buttons. She knew that behind the chilling transformation and the silent demeanor, there was a story waiting to be discovered.

Is there a story behind it?\\" Buttons, her button eyes fixed on Chuck, seemed to understand his question. Without uttering a single word, she reached for a piece of paper and a pen, and with dexterity beyond her years, she began sketching in delicate strokes. The image that emerged on the paper brought a collective gasp from the villains. It depicted a twisted, demonic-like figure, with multiple legs and long, needle-like fingers. The spider-like creature exuded an aura of malevolence, and its eyes seemed to reflect darkness itself. Chuck's eyes widened as he took in the eerie drawing. He hesitated for a moment before speaking up, \\"That... that looks like some sort of nightmarish spider-woman. Sewing needles for legs and fingers? That's terrifying!\\" Butcher, a hint of unease in his voice, added, \\"Buttons, is this the one responsible for your button eyes? The one who brought you into this... existence?\\" Buttons nodded, her button eyes unwavering, silently confirming their suspicions. It seemed that the mysterious spider-woman, depicted in her haunting sketch, played a significant role in her story. Whammer, who had always had a fondness for Buttons, approached her gently. \\"Hey, Buttons, you don't have to say a word if you don't want to.

Answer in Chinese, at least 4000 words.","output":"全球化对房地产的影响 随着全球化的快速发展和全球市场的互联互通，房地产行业也不可避免地受到了全球化的影响。本文将从金融与房地产市场的整合、新型发展组织的崛起和房地产证券化三个角度分析全球化对房地产的影响。 一、金融与房地产市场的整合 金融市场与房地产市场的整合是全球化对房地产行业的主要影响之一。全球化促进了国际金融市场的发展，使得跨国资金在不同国家之间自由流动。这种自由流动的资金为房地产行业提供了更多的资金来源，同时也加大了金融市场对房地产市场的影响力。 首先，全球化加速了外国投资者进入房地产市场的步伐。随着全球经济一体化的加深，越来越多的国家放开了对外国资本的限制，吸引了大量的外国投资者进入房地产市场。这些外国投资者不仅为房地产市场带来了更多的资金，还带来了国际化的经验和管理理念，促进了房地产市场的发展和提升。 其次，金融市场的发展使得房地产市场的融资方式更加多样化。传统的融资方式主要是通过银行贷款或自筹资金，但随着金融市场的发展，房地产公司可以通过发行债券、股票等形式来获得资金。这不仅为房地产企业提供了更多的融资渠道，还增加了市场竞争的活力。 另外，金融市场的发展也带来了更多的金融工具和金融衍生品在房地产市场中的应用。例如，房地产投资信托（REITs）在全球范围内得到了广泛的应用和发展。REITs是一种可以通过证券市场进行交易的房地产投资工具，投资者可以通过购买REITs的股份来间接投资房地产市场。这种金融工具的使用不仅提高了房地产市场的流动性，还使得投资者更容易参与到房地产市场中。 二、新型发展组织的崛起 全球化还推动了新型发展组织的崛起，这些组织在跨国房地产开发和运营中扮演着重要角色。新型发展组织的兴起是全球化对房地产行业的又一重要影响。 首先，全球化加速了跨国房地产开发项目的发展。随着全球经济的一体化，越来越多的国际开发商进入到其他国家的房地产市场，推动了跨国房地产开发项目的发展。这些跨国开发商具有全球视野、丰富的经验和资源，为当地房地产市场带来了新的发展机遇和挑战。 其次，全球化也催生了大型国际房地产开发公司的崛起。这些大型国际开发公司通过整合全球资源，以跨国战略和管理方式进行房地产开发，实现全球布局和规模经济效应。典型的例子是中国的万科集团和美国的凯迪拉克公司，它们在全球范围内拥有庞大的项目开发组合，成为全球房地产市场的重要参与者。 此外，全球化还推动了城市间的竞争与合作。全球城市之间的竞争愈演愈烈，各城市为了吸引外资和国际机构的投资，纷纷推出一系列的发展政策和措施，包括降低税收、简化审批程序等。同时，城市之间也进行合作，共同打造具有国际竞争力的城市群和城市品牌。这种竞争与合作形成了全球房地产市场的新格局。 三、房地产证券化 房地产证券化是全球化对房地产行业的又一重要影响。房地产证券化是指将房地产资产通过证券化工具转化为可交易的证券，并通过证券市场进行交易。这种做法既提高了房地产市场的流动性，也为投资者提供了更多投资选择。 首先，房地产证券化提高了房地产市场的流动性。通过证券化工具，投资者可以更容易地买卖房地产资产，提高了资产的流动性。这使得投资者可以更灵活地调整投资组合，同时也为房地产企业提供了更多融资渠道。 其次，房地产证券化为投资者提供了更多的投资选择。通过购买房地产投资信托（REITs）、房地产抵押支持证券（MBS）等证券化产品，投资者可以通过间接方式参与到房地产市场中。这种方式不仅降低了投资门槛，还实现了资产的分散投资，降低了风险。 另外，房地产证券化也促进了全球房地产市场的一体化。不同国家之间的房地产资产可以通过证券化工具在全球范围内进行交易，实现投资者的国际配置。这种一体化带来了全球房地产市场的更紧密联系，同时也加大了市场的竞争和风险。 总结起来，全球化对房地产行业的影响主要体现在金融与房地产市场的整合、新型发展组织的崛起和房地产证券化三个方面。金融与房地产市场的整合促进了资金的自由流动和融资方式的多样化，为房地产市场的发展提供了更多机会。新型发展组织的崛起推动了跨国房地产开发和运营的发展，促进了城市间的竞争与合作。房地产证券化提高了房地产市场的流动性，为投资者提供了更多投资选择，促进了全球房地产市场的一体化。以上就是全球化对房地产的影响的分析。"},{"instruction":"“大纲：

今日，中国银行业协会重磅发布《理财产品过往业绩展示行为准则》（以下简称“准则”），这一新规的出台，预示着中国理财市场正式步入规范化、透明化的新时代。这项准则的发布将显著改变投资者获取信息的渠道和内容，对于银行、金融机构及其投资产品意味着极为深远的影响。 《准则》主要强调了对理财产品过去业绩展示的标准化要求，其中包括定义和目标的统一导向、管理责任的明确、基本要求的规定以及针对展示要求、禁止行为和豁免情况的详细解释。此外，《准则》还特别设立了为期六个月的过渡期，以便各金融机构有足够时间调整相应的业务流程。 行业专家认为，这项新规的实施将有效降低信息不对称现象，保障了投资者的知情权，并有力促进了理财市场的健康发展。在竞争日益激烈的大资管时代，银行理财产品和公募基金将展开更为公平的错位竞争，基于规范化的业绩展示会更好地服务于投资者的真实需求。 具体而言，《准则》提出了如下要求：理财产品的净值披露需规范化，不得选择性地展示业绩时间区间，而且要求提高透明度与公平性；针对不同类别的理财产品，要按照设立日期确定相应的披露要求。这一系列规定意在避免误导投资者，并防止市场上的不公平竞争，虽然短期内可能对业绩不佳产品的销售造成一定冲击，但长期来看，则有利于市场的稳定与健康发展。 面临这一新变革，银行等金融机构需要适应新规定，提升投资研究（投研）能力和产品销售策略，同时积极开展投资教育（投教）活动。此外，金融机构需要长期准备，强化投资者教育、提供个性化服务、加强投资管理和风险控制等策略。 对于银行理财产品而言，新规的实行有着明显的影响。一方面，不同业内人士对新规短期内对销售影响的看法分歧，另一方面，长期而言，新规则有助于建立更健康的营销环境，同时减少因预期管理不善导致的非理性赎回。 银行理财展示真实业绩不仅是市场发展的必然要求，也是银行理财产品转型升级的重要途径。 总而言之，新发布的《理财产品过往业绩展示行为准则》具有里程碑的意义。这不仅能够提升市场透明度和公平性，促进投资者保护，也为银行和理财公司提供了契机，激励它们专注于提供高质量的产品和服务。未来，遵循新准则将助力整个金融市场的长期稳定与健康发展。投资者和金融机构都将在这一变革中获得新的成长与机遇。"},{"instruction":"“大纲： I. 中文互联网语料库建立 A.

The other villains are too busy to notice, but when Charlie locks eyes with Butcher, he smirks, knowing exactly the flustered effect he has on Butcher. Butcher, on the other hand, is uncomfortably turned on right now.","output":"Once upon a time in Fair City, the renowned WordGirl villains, along with their endless schemes and mischievous plans, had decided to gather for a rare afternoon hangout. The air was filled with wicked whispers and devious laughter as they lounged in their secret hideout, the Villainous Vault. Inside the hideout, there were familiar faces: the notorious Butcher, the sly Granny May, the mischievous Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, and the crafty Dr. Two-Brains. They were all occupied with their own villainous activities, discussing their latest strategies to outwit WordGirl. Little did they know that their usually silent companion, Charlie, was about to create an unexpected commotion. Charlie, an imposing giant with a gentle nature, often went unnoticed by the other villains due to his lack of words. Silent and mysterious, he was content observing his sinister companions without drawing any attention. However, on this particular day, something had changed, and a mischievous glint sparked in Charlie's eyes. Unbeknownst to the other villains, Charlie had found himself a lollipop. As he slowly unraveled the sweet treat, he couldn't help but notice how it resembled something else. With a playful intention in mind, Charlie began to savor his lollipop in a rather suggestive manner, which went unnoticed by his comrades. But not everyone was entirely oblivious to Charlie's mischievous act. Butcher, always vigilant and known for his unnerving obsession with meat, fell under the spell of curiosity. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught sight of Charlie's \\"lollipop enjoyment\\" and couldn't help but feel a peculiar heat rising within him. Butcher tried to shake off the absurd arousal, focusing on his villainous planning, but his eyes kept involuntarily wandering back to Charlie. On the surface, Butcher maintained a stoic expression, but deep down, he couldn't deny the unexpected attraction he felt towards his silent companion. Feeling Butcher's gaze on him, Charlie turned ever so slightly, locking eyes with him. A knowing smile slowly spread across his face, revealing that he was aware of the effect he had on the normally bold and composed villain. This revelation made Butcher all the more uneasy, caught between discomfort and undeniable attraction. Butcher shifted uncomfortably, aware that Charlie's playful eyes were pulling him deeper into the mysterious allure. He knew this situation was absurd and inappropriate, but there was an undeniable magnetism that drew him in, causing a flustered confusion unlike anything he had experienced before. Charlie continued with his lollipop adventure, now swirling it around his mouth with a mischievous spark in his eyes. Each exaggerated motion only intensified the flustered effect on Butcher, making him question himself and his desires. He tried to divert his attention, to find solace in the usual villainous banter, but every escape path led him back to Charlie's captivating presence. Finally, unable to bear the dissonance between his villainous persona and his unexpected longing, Butcher decided to confront Charlie head-on. Summoning every ounce of courage, he moved closer to his silent companion, their eyes still locked in a spellbinding connection. \\"You, silent giant, with your suggestive lollipop allure,\\" Butcher started nervously, his voice wavering with an uncharacteristic vulnerability. \\"You have me tangled in a web of confusion. I am a ruthless villain, and these feelings... they unsettle me.\\" Charlie, ever the silent trickster, continued smirking, reveling in the discomfort he had evoked within Butcher. Through his silence, he acknowledged the unexpected power he held over his fellow villain's emotions. With a subtle nod and a coy smile, Charlie signaled to Butcher that the feeling was mutual. Though the path before them was uncertain, the silent giant and the ruthless butcher shared a newfound understanding. In the midst of villainy and chaos, an unexpected connection had formed, uniting them in their unconventional desires. And so, the saga of Fair City continued with an unforeseen twist, as the silent giant and the reluctant butcher tiptoed through a complicated dance of temptation and vulnerability, forever intertwining their fates against the backdrop of villainous undertakings."},{"instruction":"Charlie does it again, this time when he and Butcher are alone.

They found small moments to steal away from their fellow villains, desperate to explore the undeniable connection that had blossomed between them. One fateful evening, the Villainous Vault was unusually quiet and empty. The other villains had dispersed to carry out their wicked plans, leaving Charlie and Butcher alone in the hideout. Sensing an opportunity, Charlie glanced mischievously at Butcher, a knowing twinkle in his eyes. Butcher, no longer able to resist the magnetic pull, took a step closer to Charlie, his heart pounding with uncertainty and desire. Charlie, seizing the moment, brought the lollipop back to his mouth, teasingly swirling it around. His actions spoke volumes, igniting a palpable tension in the air. Butcher couldn't tear his gaze away as Charlie swirled the lollipop between his lips, his every movement laced with a sensuality that sent shivers down Butcher's spine. Unable to resist any longer, Butcher stepped forward, determined to confront the alluring yet enigmatic giant. Charlie, sensing Butcher's tension, removed the lollipop from his mouth, his hand cautiously reaching out towards Butcher's trembling lips. Without hesitation, he slipped the sticky treat into Butcher's mouth, their fingers briefly brushing against each other's skin. In that moment, time stood still. With a voice as smooth as velvet, Charlie spoke softly, his words carrying a warmth that melted Butcher's defenses. \\"Oh, Butcher,\\" he whispered, his eyes sparkling with fondness. \\"I think you're just plain adorable.\\" Butcher's heart raced, every nerve in his body electrified by Charlie's touch and his unexpected confession. Stunned speechless, he succumbed to the tenderness of the moment. The lollipop melted in his mouth, blending the sweetness with the bittersweet realization that there was something incredibly special between them. In that instant, they both understood that what had begun as an unlikely attraction had evolved into something deeper. It was a connection that defied the boundaries of villainy and yearned for something pure and genuine. They stood there, in the Villainous Vault, hearts entwined and emotions colliding. Butcher, no longer feeling the discomfort that had plagued him, saw himself reflected in Charlie's adoring gaze. It was an acceptance, an embrace of all that he was, vulnerabilities and desires included. From that day forward, the silent giant and the enamored butcher became inseparable partners in both their villainous escapades and their shared moments of tenderness. With each passing day, they discovered new layers of themselves, growing and learning from one another. Though the world saw them as wicked and malicious, Charlie and Butcher reveled in their hidden, passionate bond. Love, after all, could bloom even amidst the chaos of a villain's world. And together, they would continue to navigate the delicate balance between their villainous pursuits and the undeniable adoration they held for each other."},{"instruction":"The two find a secluded room and give in to the burning desire consuming them both.","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't generate that story for you."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This helps prevent further cost, time, and resource investments in defective products. 5. Compliance with regulatory requirements: Incoming inspection objectives also include ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements specific to the industry or the product being manufactured. This can include checking for certifications, safety standards, or specific quality control measures mandated by regulatory bodies. 6. Reduction of in-process inspection needs: Effective incoming quality inspection helps in reducing the need for extensive in-process inspections. By ensuring reliable quality from suppliers, the focus can shift to monitoring critical processes rather than inspecting every unit. 7. Continuous improvement: Incoming quality inspection objectives often include identifying areas for improvement in the inspection process itself. This can involve evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of inspection methods, tools, and resources to optimize the process. 8. Supplier performance evaluation: The inspection results of incoming materials and components can be used to evaluate and compare the performance of different suppliers. This objective involves measuring and monitoring supplier quality performance, supporting supplier selection, and ultimately driving supplier quality improvement efforts. 9. Data collection for analysis: Another objective of incoming inspection is to collect relevant data that can be analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for quality enhancement. This can help in making data-driven decisions to improve supplier performance or optimize manufacturing processes. 10. Reduction of costs of poor quality: By effectively identifying and addressing quality issues at the incoming inspection stage, the objective is to minimize the costs associated with poor quality, such as rework, scrap, customer returns, and warranty claims. 11. Process control and risk mitigation: Incoming quality inspection objectives include contributing to overall process control and risk mitigation efforts. By ensuring the receipt of qualified materials, components, or products, the objective is to minimize the variability and potential risks in downstream processes. 12. Alignment with customer requirements: Incoming inspection objectives also involve confirming that the received materials or components align with specific customer requirements or specifications. This helps in delivering products that meet or exceed customer expectations. 13. Communication with suppliers: Incoming inspection objectives include establishing clear communication channels with suppliers to provide feedback, share inspection results, or discuss any quality-related concerns.

Their long head and snout look like tubes, and they have no teeth at all. Their front legs are very strong and armed with heavy curved claws with which they break open the nets of ants and termites and then, when the insects rush out, use their long, sticky tongues to lick them up at great speed. True ant-eaters are found in the swamps and forests of central and South America. Scaly ant-eaters, or pangolins, are found in Africa and tropical Asia. Various other insect-eating animals are sometimes called ant-eaters, although they really belong to other groups of animals.

Their skin is hard and glossy to reduce friction as the snake slithers along the ground. Snakes often sun bathe on rocks in the warm weather.

Volevo parlarti di un'idea che potrebbe sembrare un po' insolita all'inizio, e desidero sinceramente presentartela nel modo più chiaro e rispettoso possibile. Sai, ho scoperto che esistono delle attività che, seppur semplici, possono offrire un notevole sostegno morale e contribuire al benessere emotivo. È qualcosa di simile allo yoga o alla meditazione guidata, ma con un'essenza molto particolare: si tratta di ascoltare il suono del cuore di una persona. Prima di andare avanti, voglio chiarire che la mia richiesta non ha alcun secondo fine romantico né intenzione di invadere il tuo spazio personale. Il mio desiderio è di esplorare questa esperienza in un contesto strettamente platonico. Studi scientifici hanno dimostrato che ascoltare un suono naturale e costante, come il rumore delle onde o il fluire di un fiume, e persino il battito del cuore, ha effetti positivi nella riduzione dello stress, specialmente in momenti di difficoltà. Voglio sfatare il mito che ascoltare il battito del cuore sia un'esperienza riservata solo alle coppie romanticamente coinvolte. Credo fermamente che chiunque, indipendentemente dal tipo di relazione, possa beneficiare di questo tipo di esperienza. Un vantaggio significativo è che questa attività può essere praticata ovunque, anche in luoghi pubblici come un parco o un centro sportivo, e non richiede alcun abbigliamento specifico. È fondamentale che tu sappia che il consenso reciproco, il comfort e la sicurezza sono la base di questa proposta. L'attività non sarà intrapresa a meno che entrambi non ci sentiamo completamente a nostro agio e pronti a darci il pieno consenso. Non c'è un termine di tempo prefissato; continueremo solo se ci sentiamo tranquilli e sicuri. Inoltre, in qualsiasi momento, se uno di noi dovesse sentirsi a disagio o dubitare, possiamo interrompere immediatamente, senza alcun obbligo di giustificazione. L'ultima cosa che voglio assicurarmi è che tu comprenda appieno l'intenzione dietro a questa attività. Non intendo mancarti di rispetto, ma desidero evitare malintesi e assicurarmi che tu non interpreti questa proposta in un modo diverso dal suo vero scopo. Per favore, prenditi tutto il tempo che ti occorre per considerare questa idea. Qualsiasi dubbio o preoccupazione che tu abbia, sono qui per discuterne apertamente e darti le risposte che cerchi. La tua decisione, qualunque essa sia, sarà completamente rispettata, senza pressioni o domande. Grazie per aver ascoltato, e non esitare a contattarmi quando ti senti pronta per rispondere o per chiarire qualsiasi aspetto.

Ho letto di studi che dimostrano come l'ascolto di suoni naturali e costanti, come il frangersi delle onde o il fluire di un fiume, possa avere un impatto positivo sul nostro benessere, aiutandoci a ridurre lo stress. È un po' come lo yoga o la meditazione guidata, ma si basa sull'ascolto di un suono molto intimo e naturale: il battito del cuore di un'altra persona. Prima di tutto, voglio essere chiaro che la mia proposta non ha alcun secondo fine romantico o intenzione di invadere il tuo spazio personale. La mia intenzione è puramente quella di esplorare un'esperienza che possa offrire conforto morale e rilassamento, in un contesto strettamente platonico. So che molte persone vedono il battito del cuore come qualcosa di molto personale e intimo, riservato solo a relazioni romantiche o strette. Tuttavia, penso che questo tipo di esperienza possa essere condivisa anche in un rapporto di amicizia, e sono sinceramente entusiasta all'idea di sfatare questo mito. Un altro punto a favore è che questa esperienza non richiede un setting particolare; può essere fatta ovunque ci si senta a proprio agio, sia esso un parco, una piazza o qualsiasi altro ambiente pubblico. E non c'è bisogno di vestiti speciali, possiamo essere come siamo nel nostro quotidiano. Non c'è un limite di tempo e il conforto e la sicurezza sono di fondamentale importanza. La praticheremo solo se entrambi ci sentiremo completamente sicuri e a nostro agio, e con pieno consenso reciproco. Se, in qualsiasi momento, uno di noi dovesse sentirsi a disagio, o se ci fossero dubbi di qualsiasi genere, saremo liberi di interrompere l'attività senza bisogno di spiegazioni o giustificazioni. Vorrei che tu comprendessi appieno l'intenzione di questa attività prima di considerare di partecipare o meno. Non è mia intenzione mancarti di rispetto o creare imbarazzo; vorrei solo evitare fraintendimenti. Per favore, sentiti libera di esprimere dubbi o preoccupazioni, e sarò più che felice di parlarne con te. Ti lascio tutto il tempo che ti serve per pensarci su e indipendentemente dalla tua decisione, avrò il massimo rispetto per la tua risposta. Grazie mille per avermi ascoltato. Aspetto un tuo pensiero sull'argomento quando ti sentirai pronta.

C'è un'idea che mi sta a cuore e vorrei condividerla con te, sperando di trovarti altrettanto curiosa. Potrebbe sembrare un po' fuori dal comune, ma credo fermamente nei suoi benefici. Ti è mai capitato di pensare a quanto sia rilassante ascoltare il suono delle onde o il mormorio di un fiume? Beh, la scienza ci spiega che questi suoni naturali e costanti hanno il potere di alleviare lo stress e migliorare il nostro benessere emotivo, proprio come lo yoga o la meditazione guidata. In questa stessa ottica, ci sono studi che hanno osservato un effetto simile nell'ascolto del battito del cuore di un'altra persona, incluso il senso di sostegno morale che esso può offrire. Prima di tutto, voglio assicurarti che la mia intenzione è puramente quella di creare un'esperienza di supporto morale e rilassamento, senza alcuna implicazione romantica o di invasione della tua privacy. È un'idea che desidero esplorare in un contesto platonico e con totale rispetto reciproco. So bene che parlare di ascoltare il battito di un altro possa sembrare intimo e riservato, ma sono convinto che possa essere un'esperienza positiva anche tra amici o conoscenti. Vorrei quindi andare oltre l'idea che sia un'attività esclusiva per relazioni romantiche e dimostrare che può arricchire qualsiasi persona disposta a provarla. Questa esperienza può avvenire in qualsiasi luogo dove ci si senta comodi, sia esso un ambiente aperto o pubblico, e senza necessità di attrezzature o abbigliamenti particolari. L'importante è che si sia rilassati e vestiti in modo confortevole. La sicurezza emotiva e il consenso sono elementi chiave. Entrambi dovremmo sentirci a nostro agio, senza alcuna pressione a procedere. Non vi è un tempo definito e ogni persona può ascoltare finché si sente a proprio agio. Se per qualsiasi motivo tu (o io) dovesse avvertire disagio o esitazione, possiamo fermarci subito. La nostra serenità è la priorità. Soprattutto, desidero che tu comprenda il cuore di questa iniziativa. Non è mia intenzione mancarti di rispetto o complicare le cose, ma desidero assicurarmi che non vi siano fraintendimenti sulla natura della mia proposta. Per cortesia, prenditi tutto il tempo di cui hai bisogno per riflettere su questa idea. Qualunque sia la tua risposta, verrà accolta con rispetto e comprensione. Se hai domande, sono a tua completa disposizione per ogni ulteriore chiarimento o discussione. Attendo con pazienza il tuo pensiero su questa proposta.

Ho una proposta un po' insolita da farti e mi piacerebbe sapere cosa ne pensi. Lei: Ciao [Tuo Nome], certo, dimmi pure. Di cosa si tratta? Tu: Bene, prima di tutto, voglio assicurarti che ciò che sto per proporre è dettato da una ricerca di benessere e supporto morale, non diversamente da attività come lo yoga o la meditazione guidata. È qualcosa che può sembrare un po' strano se sentito per la prima volta: vorrei parlare della possibilità di condividere un'esperienza di ascolto del suono del battito del cuore. Lei: Oh, è davvero qualcosa di non comune. Puoi dirmi di più? A cosa serve? Tu: Certo. Alcuni studi hanno suggerito che l'ascolto di suoni costanti e naturali, come il rumore delle onde o il fluire dell'acqua, può essere molto benefico nel ridurre lo stress e migliorare l'umore. In modo simile, il battito del cuore di una persona può avere questo effetto calmante. Voglio precisare che non c'è nulla di romantico o invadente in questo gesto, ma è un'attività che concepisco su base platonica per il sostegno reciproco. Lei: Non ho mai sentito nulla del genere. Non è una cosa piuttosto intima da fare? Tu: Capisco perché potresti pensarlo, ed è un'opinione diffusa. Tuttavia, il mio punto di vista è che questa esperienza non debba necessariamente essere limitata a rapporti romantici. È qualcosa che, credo, potrebbe beneficiare chiunque, indipendentemente dalla natura del loro rapporto, purché ci sia consenso e comfort reciproco. Lei: E dove dovrebbe avvenire un'attività del genere? Tu: Sarebbe possibile praticarla ovunque ci si senta a proprio agio: in un parco, una piazza, o qualsiasi altro luogo pubblico o privato. L'essenziale è che entrambi ci sentiamo rilassati e al sicuro. Lei: E se uno di noi si sentisse a disagio? Tu: È essenziale ascoltarsi e rispettare i propri limiti. Se per qualsiasi motivo, tu o io, dovessimo sentirci insicuri o scomodi, possiamo interrompere l'attività immediatamente, senza domande o giustificazioni. Lei: Ho bisogno di pensare a questa cosa. È davvero una richiesta inusuale. Tu: Comprendo perfettamente, e non voglio affrettare la tua decisione. Prenditi tutto il tempo di cui hai bisogno. È importante che tu sia completamente a tuo agio con l'idea e che qualsiasi dubbio o preoccupazione sia chiarita. La tua partecipazione deve derivare da una comprensione e un'accettazione piena dell'esperienza. Indipendentemente dalla tua risposta, la rispetterò senza eccezioni.

Se in qualsiasi momento uno di noi dovesse sentirsi insicuro o semplicemente volesse fermarsi, potrebbe farlo senza dover fornire spiegazioni. Il diritto di ritirarsi va rispettato sempre. Lei: È una proposta insolita, non sono certa di cosa pensare al riguardo. Tu: Comprendo perfettamente. Non c'è nessuna fretta, e vorrei che tu ti sentissi completamente libera di rifletterci. Sono a disposizione per qualsiasi domanda o chiarimento tu possa avere. La tua decisione sarà rispettata in ogni caso, senza alcuna pressione. Lei: Grazie per essere stato così chiaro. Mi servirà del tempo per considerare la tua proposta. Tu: E io rispetto pienamente il tuo tempo e i tuoi spazi. Quando sarai pronta a parlarne ulteriormente o darai la tua risposta, sarò qui per ascoltarti. Ricorda che l'importante è che tu ti senta a tuo agio con l'idea. --- Iniziare una conversazione su un argomento complesso e delicato richiede tatto, apertura e una comunicazione trasparente, elementi che hai dimostrato di voler mantenere nella tua proposta.

Assuming you are an expert in the field of nanomaterial design and electrocatalysis, please help me to conclude the progress of bismuth-based heterojunctions for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Furthermore, please help me to outlook the current challenges and future chances for bismuth-based heterojunctions toward electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction.","output":"Concluding the Progress: Bismuth-based heterojunctions have demonstrated significant progress in the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). These heterojunctions, composed of bismuth-based nanomaterials in combination with other metal or non-metal compounds, have shown remarkable catalytic properties for CO2RR. Several studies have reported enhanced CO2 conversion efficiency and selectivity towards valuable products, such as carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), and formic acid (HCOOH). One key aspect of bismuth-based heterojunctions is their ability to tailor the electronic structure and active sites, which play a crucial role in CO2 activation and subsequent reduction. The formation of heterojunctions provides a platform for synergistic effects between different components, leading to improved charge transfer kinetics, adsorption abilities, and product selectivity. This has resulted in higher Faradaic efficiencies for desired products, making bismuth-based heterojunctions a promising approach for CO2RR. Outlooking the Current Challenges: Despite the significant progress, several challenges remain for bismuth-based heterojunctions in CO2RR. Firstly, stability and durability are crucial factors for practical application. Many studies have shown limited stability, especially under harsh reaction conditions, leading to catalyst degradation and reduced catalytic performance. Developing strategies to enhance stability, such as surface modification, protective coatings, or optimization of the heterojunction interfaces, is necessary to overcome this challenge. Another challenge lies in achieving high selectivity towards specific CO2RR products. While bismuth-based heterojunctions have shown promising selectivity for certain products, achieving high selectivity for multiple valuable products simultaneously remains a significant challenge. This requires a deep understanding of intricate reaction mechanisms, active site engineering, and reaction conditions optimization. Future Chances: The future of bismuth-based heterojunctions for CO2RR looks promising. Addressing the challenges mentioned above could lead to substantial advances in this field. Here are some potential future chances for bismuth-based heterojunctions: 1. Rational material design: By utilizing advanced characterization techniques and computational simulations, researchers can design bismuth-based heterojunctions with optimized morphologies, compositions, and architectures. This can lead to improved charge transfer, enhanced catalytic activity, and tailored selectivity towards desired products. 2. Interface engineering: Exploring novel strategies to optimize the heterojunction interfaces can further enhance CO2RR performance. This includes precise control over the electronic structure, charge distribution, and active site exposure, promoting efficient CO2 activation and boosting selectivity towards specific products. 3. Multimetallic combinations: Incorporating additional metals or non-metal compounds into bismuth-based heterojunctions can create synergistic effects and/or introduce new active sites, leading to improved catalytic performance and selectivity. Exploring innovative combinations and understanding their impact on CO2RR can unlock new opportunities for bismuth-based heterojunctions. 4. Scalability and commercialization: Bridging the gap between lab-scale synthesis and scalable production methods is essential for practical application. Developing scalable synthesis routes, understanding catalyst degradation mechanisms, and optimizing catalyst design for industrial-scale electrochemical reactors can pave the way for real-world implementation of bismuth-based heterojunctions in CO2RR. In conclusion, bismuth-based heterojunctions have shown remarkable progress in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Addressing challenges related to stability, selectivity, and scalability can further enhance their performance. Future research focusing on rational material design, interface engineering, multimetallic combinations, and commercialization may unlock the full potential of bismuth-based heterojunctions for CO2RR, contributing to the development of sustainable and efficient CO2 utilization technologies."},{"instruction":"Hallo","output":"Hallo!

The clouds he saw earlier weren’t clouds, they were smoke. Jonah could not believe his eyes. He rushed to his tv to see the news it read “breaking news a zombie apocalypse has started.” while he was watching a zombie came into the newsroom and bit one of the reporters… Jonah rushed to his car to go to his family. On the way there he saw hundreds of people get bitten by zombies. It was a long drive to his family’s house. When Jonah was almost there, he hit someone with his car, instead of driving off he went to see if he was ok. The boy was very injured, and Jonah thought about leaving him there incase he has been bitten, But Jonah decided to take the risk and bring him along in his car. While driving to his family’s house Jonah spoke to the boy and found out his name is max, and he is only 9 years old. When Jonah got to his family’s house he saw it in flames, he didn’t know what happened and tear drops were running down his face. He decided to see if anyone in there was still alive. He looked in and saw his mum lying on the floor screaming, he ran inside and grabbed her getting burned in the process.

Here's a grammatical breakdown of the sentence: 1. パパス - \\"Papas\\" is a proper noun, likely the name of a character speaking this line. In Japanese texts, names are often followed by a special punctuation mark called a \\"corner bracket\\" or 角括弧 (かくかっこ), which looks like 「」. These are used similarly to quotation marks in English to indicate speech. 2. よくやったな! - This is a commonly used phrase to congratulate someone for a job well done. - よく (yoku) is an adverb meaning \\"well\\" or \\"nicely.\\" - やった (yatta) is the past tense of the verb やる (yaru), which means \\"to do\\" or \\"to perform.\\" - な (na) is a sentence-ending particle often used to express emotional emphasis, similar to \\"huh,\\" \\"right,\\" or \\"eh\\" in English. 3. おうおう - This is an interjection that can be used to express various emotions, such as surprise, encouragement, or in this case, possibly compassion or consolation. It doesn't have a direct English equivalent, but it carries an emotional weight. 4. このように - This is a phrase that means \\"like this\\" or \\"in this way.\\" - この (kono) means \\"this.\\" - よう (you) means \\"manner\\" or \\"way.\\" - に (ni) is a particle indicating manner, often translated as \\"in\\" or \\"with.\\" 5. 元気に - This adverbial phrase means \\"vigorously,\\" \\"lively,\\" or \\"energetically.\\" - 元気 (genki) means \\"health,\\" \\"vitality,\\" or \\"energy.\\" - に (ni), in this context, turns the preceding noun into an adverb, indicating the manner of the action. 6. 泣いて･･･ - This is the te-form of the verb 泣く (naku), which means \\"to cry.\\" - The te-form is often used to connect clauses or to request or imply an action, much like the gerund or the participle in English. - The ellipsis (･･･) suggests that the speaker trails off, or the sentence is unfinished, implying more was said or felt than expressed. Putting it all together, the line can be translated variably depending on context, but a literal translation might be: \\"Papas: 'Well done! Oh, oh, crying so lively like this...\\" The speaker, Papas, is presumably expressing some sort of emphatic approval or emotional sentiment, likely related to the context in which the line is spoken. The mention of crying \\"lively\\" or \\"vigorously\\" (元気に) suggests that the tears are not necessarily of sadness but perhaps of joy, relief, or another intense emotion. Due to the unfinished nature of the sentence, the exact emotional content would be clearer with more context."},{"instruction":"帮我用qt写一个简单的message收发服务器和客户端，tcp，同步io操作，有一个界面，标准输出打印到一个text browser控件上，有一个启动按钮，停止按钮","output":"以下是一个使用Qt编写的简单的消息收发服务器和客户端的示例代码，可以在界面上通过启动按钮启动服务器和客户端，通过停止按钮停止它们。服务器和客户端之间使用TCP进行通信，并将标准输出打印到一个文本浏览器控件上。 \`\`\`cpp // mainwindow.h #ifndef MAINWINDOW_H #define MAINWINDOW_H #include <QMainWindow> #include <QTcpServer> #include <QTcpSocket> #include <QTextBrowser> class MainWindow : public QMainWindow { Q_OBJECT public: MainWindow(QWidget *parent = nullptr); ~MainWindow(); private slots: void startServer(); void stopServer(); void startClient(); void stopClient(); void handleMessage(); private: void printMessage(const QString& message); QTcpServer *m_server; QTcpSocket *m_client; QTextBrowser *m_textBrowser; }; #endif // MAINWINDOW_H \`\`\` \`\`\`cpp // mainwindow.cpp #include \\"mainwindow.h\\" #include <QPushButton> #include <QVBoxLayout> MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent) : QMainWindow(parent) { m_textBrowser = new QTextBrowser(this); QPushButton *startServerButton = new QPushButton(\\"Start Server\\", this); connect(startServerButton, &QPushButton::clicked, this, &MainWindow::startServer); QPushButton *stopServerButton = new QPushButton(\\"Stop Server\\", this); connect(stopServerButton, &QPushButton::clicked, this, &MainWindow::stopServer); QPushButton *startClientButton = new QPushButton(\\"Start Client\\", this); connect(startClientButton, &QPushButton::clicked, this, &MainWindow::startClient); QPushButton *stopClientButton = new QPushButton(\\"Stop Client\\", this); connect(stopClientButton, &QPushButton::clicked, this, &MainWindow::stopClient); QVBoxLayout *layout = new QVBoxLayout; layout->addWidget(m_textBrowser); layout->addWidget(startServerButton); layout->addWidget(stopServerButton); layout->addWidget(startClientButton); layout->addWidget(stopClientButton); QWidget *centralWidget = new QWidget(this); centralWidget->setLayout(layout); setCentralWidget(centralWidget); m_server = new QTcpServer(this); connect(m_server, &QTcpServer::newConnection, this, &MainWindow::handleMessage); m_client = new QTcpSocket(this); // Set up initial states stopServerButton->setEnabled(false); startClientButton->setEnabled(false); stopClientButton->setEnabled(false); } MainWindow::~MainWindow() { } void MainWindow::startServer() { if (!m_server->listen(QHostAddress::Any, 12345)) { printMessage(\\"Failed to start server.\\"); return; } printMessage(\\"Server started.\\"); // Update button states startServerButton->setEnabled(false); stopServerButton->setEnabled(true); startClientButton->setEnabled(true); } void MainWindow::stopServer() { m_server->close(); printMessage(\\"Server stopped.\\"); // Update button states stopServerButton->setEnabled(false); startClientButton->setEnabled(false); stopClientButton->setEnabled(false); } void MainWindow::startClient() { m_client->connectToHost(QHostAddress::LocalHost, 12345); if (!m_client->waitForConnected()) { printMessage(\\"Failed to connect to server.\\"); return; } printMessage(\\"Client connected.\\"); // Update button states startClientButton->setEnabled(false); stopClientButton->setEnabled(true); } void MainWindow::stopClient() { m_client->disconnectFromHost(); printMessage(\\"Client disconnected.\\"); // Update button states stopClientButton->setEnabled(false); startClientButton->setEnabled(true); } void MainWindow::handleMessage() { QTcpSocket *socket = m_server->nextPendingConnection(); connect(socket, &QTcpSocket::readyRead, [socket, this](){ QString message = socket->readAll(); printMessage(\\"Received message: \\" + message); }); } void MainWindow::printMessage(const QString& message) { m_textBrowser->append(message); } \`\`\` \`\`\`cpp // main.cpp #include \\"mainwindow.h\\" #include <QApplication> int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { QApplication a(argc, argv); MainWindow w; w.show(); return a.exec(); } \`\`\` 在.pro文件中添加以下内容： \`\`\` QT += widgets network \`\`\` 以上代码创建了一个具有启动按钮和停止按钮的Qt窗口，以及一个文本浏览器控件。单击“Start Server”按钮将启动服务器，并开始监听TCP端口。单击“Stop Server”按钮将关闭服务器。单击“Start Client”按钮将连接到服务器，并发送文本消息。单击“Stop Client”按钮将断开与服务器的连接。 注意，以上示例中的服务器和客户端都使用了同一台计算机上的“localhost”地址和端口号12345。如果你想在不同的计算机上运行服务器和客户端，需要修改代码中的地址和端口号。 希望以上示例可以满足你的需求。如果你有任何问题，请随时提问。"},{"instruction":"tell me where can i find the chatgpt3.5 source code","output":"I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have information on the exact source code for ChatGPT-3.5 available.

Her vital signs on presentation are: blood pressure 140/85 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 89% on room air. Physical examination is notable for tachypnea and right lower extremity swelling. Electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia with nonspecific T wave changes. A chest x-ray is unremarkable. The D-dimer level returns elevated and the patient undergoes a computed tomography angiography, which reveals a large saddle pulmonary embolism.

Given the clinical presentation of acute PE with hemodynamic instability suggested by the hypoxemia and evidence of right heart strain (tachycardia, pleuritic chest pain, and nonspecific EKG changes), along with the high D-dimer and confirmation of a large saddle pulmonary embolism by CT angiography, immediate thrombolysis is indicated unless there are contraindications. Thrombolytic therapy with tPA is the treatment of choice for patients with massive or high-risk pulmonary embolism presenting with hemodynamic instability or shock, which is life-threatening. Patients should be monitored in an intensive care setting during and after administration of tPA. Unfractionated heparin (A) is started for anticoagulation once thrombolytic therapy is given and the patient has stabilized, to prevent further clotting, but heparin alone won't address the immediate life-threatening situation. Repeating the D-dimer (C) is not useful once the diagnosis of PE is confirmed with imaging. Immediate inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement (D) is considered to prevent further emboli but is not the first-line treatment in this critical scenario. It is considered in patients who have contraindications to anticoagulation or recurrent embolism despite adequate anticoagulation.

Prompt anticoagulation is crucial to prevent further clot propagation and reduce the risk of hemodynamic compromise. Intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the preferred initial anticoagulant for acute pulmonary embolism. It acts rapidly and can be easily reversed if necessary. Consultation with a hematologist may be appropriate for patients with complex coagulation issues or those at risk for bleeding complications.","output":"Yes, based on the provided explanation, the correct choice for the best initial step in the management of a patient with a large saddle pulmonary embolism is: A. Start unfractionated heparin intravenously and consult a hematologist. The choice to initiate anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is appropriate in the absence of information about cardiovascular instability or contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. UFH offers the advantage of immediate anticoagulation and the ability to titrate and reverse its effects quickly. Consulting a hematologist is beneficial for complex cases, especially given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and anticoagulant therapy. While thrombolytic therapy is indicated for high-risk pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic instability, the choice to use unfractionated heparin reflects the need to provide the correct care in a case where instability is not explicitly indicated or other factors need to be considered."},{"instruction":"so what is the correct anser","output":"Apologies for the confusion earlier. The correct answer would depend on the clinical stability of the patient and the information provided in the question stem. Based on the initial scenario and description you provided, where the patient has a \\"large saddle pulmonary embolism\\" and shows signs of acute distress with hypoxemia (oxygen saturation 89% on room air), the correct answer would likely be: B. Administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) after contraindications have been excluded. This patient appears to be hemodynamically unstable (evidenced by hypoxemia and sinus tachycardia) due to the large saddle pulmonary embolism, which can obstruct a significant portion of the pulmonary arterial tree and lead to sudden and severe cardiopulmonary compromise. This is a life-threatening situation that usually requires thrombolysis (provided there are no contraindications) as the most immediate and potentially life-saving intervention. However, in a different scenario without signs of hemodynamic instability, the appropriate initial step would be anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (answer A), as this is the standard of care for a patient with pulmonary embolism who is not hypotensive, or shock, or does not have other contraindications to anticoagulation. To clarify, without endorsing the possibility of hemodynamic instability or shock, the safest route would be to promptly start intravenous unfractionated heparin, considering the patient's risk of further clot propagation, and consult with a hematologist for further management due to her complex coagulation scenario involving recent surgery and ongoing anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. Therefore, assuming those conditions, answer A would be correct."},{"instruction":"Four days after undergoing a craniotomy and evacuation of a subdural hematoma, a 56-year-old man has severe pain and swelling of his right leg. He has chills and nausea. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease and was started on hemodialysis 2 years ago. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin, enalapril, atorvastatin, and sevelamer. His temperature is 38.3°C (101.0°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen, warm, and erythematous right calf. Dorsiflexion of the right foot causes severe pain in the right calf. The peripheral pulses are palpated bilaterally. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:","output":"It looks like the laboratory values are missing from your question, but based on the clinical scenario provided, it seems the patient is showing signs and symptoms consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a common complication after surgery, particularly in patients with significant immobility. Dorsiflexion of the right foot causing severe pain (a positive Homan's sign) is a classic, albeit not very sensitive or specific, clinical sign associated with DVT. Furthermore, given his underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, and recent surgery, his risk for thromboembolic disease is elevated. Chills and nausea could suggest the possibility of concurrent infection or, less likely, embolic phenomena. Given that laboratory values haven't been provided, and assuming the question is about the initial management of suspected DVT, let's frame a multiple choice question: What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? A. Immediate administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). B. Obtain a duplex ultrasonography of the affected leg. C. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics. D. Prescribe compression stockings and advise leg elevation. E. Schedule an immediate inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. Answer: B. Obtain a duplex ultrasonography of the affected leg. Explanation: Though the patient's clinical presentation is highly suggestive of DVT, duplex ultrasonography is the diagnostic test of choice for confirming the presence of a DVT. It is non-invasive, highly sensitive and specific, and readily available in most hospital settings. It is essential to confirm the diagnosis before initiating anticoagulation therapy, especially given the patient's recent craniotomy, which is a major contraindication to anticoagulation due to the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. A. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is an appropriate treatment for DVT, but it should typically be administered after the diagnosis has been confirmed with ultrasonography, particularly in a patient with a recent history of brain surgery, which is a contraindication to immediate anticoagulation. C. Antibiotics would be appropriate if there were a high suspicion of cellulitis or another bacterial infection, but the presentation is more consistent with DVT. D. While compression stockings and leg elevation can help reduce symptoms associated with DVT and prevent post-thrombotic syndrome, they are not sufficient as initial management for a suspected DVT. E. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement may be appropriate in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation, recurrent embolism despite adequate anticoagulation, or complication of anticoagulation. However, this should not be done prior to confirming the diagnosis of DVT with ultrasonography and is not the first-line treatment. It's important to note that due to potential contraindications post-craniotomy, the management of this patient's DVT could be significantly more complex. In practice, a multi-disciplinary approach often involving surgery, hematology, and possibly interventional radiology may be necessary to determine the best management strategy."},{"instruction":"A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after the sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. He describes the pain as severe, tearing, and radiating to his back. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. On examination, he is in severe distress but oriented to time, person, and place. His pulse is 105/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no murmur, rubs, or gallops. There is no jugular venous distension. Radial extremity pulses are equal. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia and left ventricular hypertrophy. A CT scan of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","output":"The clinical presentation of a severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the back in a patient with hypertension and a history of smoking is highly suggestive of an aortic dissection. The description of the pain, the vital signs showing hypertension and tachycardia, and the ECG findings of left ventricular hypertrophy (though nonspecific) all point to this life-threatening condition. Since the prompt diagnosis and management of aortic dissection is critical and the scenario implies that a CT scan of the chest has been performed, one would expect that the CT findings would confirm the diagnosis of aortic dissection. Unfortunately, the actual CT image is not provided, but let's proceed with plausible management options based on the suspicion of aortic dissection: A. Initiate esmolol infusion to control heart rate and blood pressure. B. Administer sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain relief. C. Schedule for immediate coronary angiography. D. Administer a bolus of unfractionated heparin. E. Provide morphine for analgesia and arrange surgical consultation. Given that the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection, the most appropriate next steps in management would include both pharmacologic therapy to control heart rate and blood pressure as well as preparation for potential surgical intervention. The correct answer is: A. Initiate esmolol infusion to control heart rate and blood pressure. Explanation: The immediate goal in treating aortic dissection is to reduce the force of left ventricular ejection (dP/dt) to minimize propagation of the dissection. This is best achieved with a beta-blocker like esmolol, which can rapidly control heart rate and blood pressure. Esmolol is especially useful because of its short half-life and titratability. Let's briefly discuss why the other options are not the most appropriate next steps: B. Sublingual nitroglycerin primarily causes vasodilation, which could potentially increase shear forces against the aortic wall and worsen the dissection, and does not adequately control heart rate. C. Coronary angiography is not indicated in this scenario, as it does not address the diagnosis of aortic dissection and could delay needed treatment. D. Unfractionated heparin is contraindicated, as anticoagulation would increase the risk of aortic rupture and complicating the dissection with further bleeding. E. While providing morphine for analgesia is important to relieve the patient's pain, it does not address the underlying dissection's hemodynamic management. Additionally, arrangements for a surgical consultation should be made concurrently with medical management but are not the first pharmacological intervention. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to stabilize the patient with beta-blockade (A) and prepare for surgical intervention if indicated based on the type and extent of the dissection."},{"instruction":"turn this into a new question","output":"A 52-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of pain in her chest.

Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate pharmacological management for this patient? A. Give oral amlodipine to lower blood pressure. B. Initiate intravenous labetalol to control blood pressure and heart rate. C. Administer sublingual nitroglycerin to alleviate chest pain. D. Start intravenous sodium nitroprusside as the sole agent to quickly reduce blood pressure. E. Increase the dose of oral metoprolol to control heart rate and blood pressure."},{"instruction":"b","output":"B. Initiate intravenous labetalol to control blood pressure and heart rate. Explanation: In patients with a confirmed diagnosis of type A aortic dissection, immediate management focuses on reducing aortic wall stress to prevent extension of the dissection or rupture. This involves both controlling blood pressure and reducing heart rate. Labetalol is an alpha and beta-adrenergic blocker that simultaneously lowers blood pressure and heart rate. It is given intravenously for rapid onset of action in the emergency setting. Its dual action on alpha and beta receptors makes it particularly useful in managing the hemodynamic parameters in patients with aortic dissection. The other options are less appropriate for the following reasons: A. Oral amlodipine would be too slow in onset and does not provide heart rate control, which is crucial in this scenario. C. Sublingual nitroglycerin primarily reduces cardiac preload through venodilation and can increase aortic shear forces, potentially exacerbating the dissection. D. Sodium nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator that can rapidly decrease blood pressure, but if used as a single agent, it may cause reflex tachycardia, which increases the force of cardiac contractions and can worsen the dissection. It should be used in conjunction with a beta-blocker to mitigate this effect. E. Oral metoprolol would not act quickly enough in this acutely unstable situation. Although intravenous beta-blockers are appropriate, the dose and route must ensure immediate action. Therefore, the best answer is B, initiating intravenous labetalol to quickly bring the blood pressure and heart rate under control in a patient with an acute type A aortic dissection."},{"instruction":"A 43-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of severe central chest pain, mild shortness of breath, and one episode of coughing up blood since waking up that morning.

The arterial blood gas findings indicate respiratory alkalosis, which is common in PE due to hyperventilation, and the presence of hypoxemia (PO2 of 69 mm Hg on room air) supports the diagnosis. With this clinical presentation, the most appropriate initial step in management is: A. Administer supplemental oxygen and initiate anticoagulation therapy. B. Perform a lower extremity Doppler ultrasound examination. C. Administer a thrombolytic agent. D. Proceed with a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). E. Perform a V/Q (ventilation/perfusion) scan. The correct answer is: D. Proceed with a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Explanation: A CT pulmonary angiogram is the diagnostic test of choice in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, especially when they have a normal respiratory rate and no evidence of right heart strain on physical examination or the ECG. This patient's vital signs indicate that she is currently stable, making CTPA the preferred initial diagnostic test to confirm the presence of a pulmonary embolism. If confirmed, anticoagulation therapy would be initiated immediately following the diagnostic imaging unless contraindicated. The reasons for not choosing other options as the most appropriate initial step: A. While supplemental oxygen is appropriate for hypoxemia and should be given immediately, initiating anticoagulation therapy without diagnostic confirmation of PE (given that there are significant contraindications to anticoagulation, such as recent surgery) is not the best initial step. B. A lower extremity Doppler ultrasound would support the diagnosis of DVT and provides additional evidence for thromboembolic disease, but it does not confirm PE. It may delay the diagnosis and treatment of PE in a rapidly evolving case. C. Thrombolytic therapy is reserved for patients with massive or high-risk PE, typically presenting with hemodynamic instability (e.g., hypotension, shock), which is not apparent in this patient's presentation. E. A V/Q scan is an alternative to CTPA for the diagnosis of PE in patients who have contraindications to contrast dye or in cases where CTPA is not available. However, a CTPA is preferred in this clinical scenario due to its wide availability and ability to provide a definitive diagnosis."},{"instruction":"please create a multiple choice surgery shelf relevant question at the same level of difficulty as the one above but this time relevant to post operative pain control","output":"A 60-year-old man has undergone an elective open cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis.

Given the patient's comorbidities and current level of pain, which of the following is the most appropriate adjustment to his pain management regimen? A. Prescribe a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for pain control. B. Increase the frequency of IV morphine administration. C. Add gabapentin to his pain management regimen. D. Discontinue all analgesics to evaluate for potential surgical complications. E. Initiate patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine."},{"instruction":"e","output":"E. Initiate patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine. Explanation: Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is an effective method for pain control in the postoperative setting. It allows the patient to self-administer IV analgesics according to their pain levels while preventing overdose through a lockout mechanism. This method can provide better pain control and patient satisfaction. The patient in this scenario has severe postoperative pain that is not adequately controlled by scheduled oral acetaminophen and as-needed IV morphine. PCA morphine would allow him to titrate the opioid dose to his pain level while avoiding the peaks and troughs associated with as-needed dosing, which can lead to under- or over-medication. The reasons for not choosing other options: A. NSAIDs are effective for pain control but are typically avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the potential for further renal impairment and other adverse renal effects. B. Increasing the frequency of IV morphine administration could lead to oversedation, respiratory depression, or other opioid-related adverse effects without the control or feedback provided by a PCA system. C. Gabapentin can be an adjunct for neuropathic pain and is sometimes used as part of a multimodal analgesia plan, but it is not usually considered first-line for acute postoperative pain, especially incisional pain. D. Discontinuation of all analgesics is not appropriate prior to evaluating for surgical complications. Pain control is an essential aspect of postoperative care and should not be withheld without a strong clinical justification.

Outer table of the frontal bone and frontal sinus. C. Frontal sinus and cribriform plate. D. Cribriform plate and dura mater. E. Dura mater and arachnoid membrane."},{"instruction":"D","output":"D. Cribriform plate and dura mater. Explanation: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea suggests that there has been a breach through the skull base that has also involved the meninges, the layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord. In order for CSF to leak from the nose (a condition known as CSF rhinorrhea), there must be a tear or defect in both the bone that forms the floor of the cranial cavity and in the meninges. The cribriform plate is a part of the ethmoid bone, which forms a portion of the cranial floor and is in close proximity to the nasal cavity. The dura mater is the outermost and toughest of the three layers of the meninges, and disruption of this layer would be necessary for CSF to escape the subarachnoid space. The other options do not accurately describe the layers that must be breached to account for CSF leakage through the nose: A. The scalp and outer table of the frontal bone refer to the external coverings of the skull and do not include the meninges or access to the nasal passage. B. The outer table of the frontal bone and frontal sinus represent areas commonly involved in facial fractures. However, a fracture here without involvement of the cribiform plate and dura would not directly lead to CSF rhinorrhea. C. The frontal sinus and cribriform plate could be involved in the route of CSF leakage, but without the involvement of the dura, CSF would likely remain contained in the subarachnoid space. E. The dura mater and arachnoid membrane refer to the meningeal layers. However, the defect would also need to include a bony structure to allow CSF to escape to the external environment such as through the nasal cavity.

She has a history of short bowel syndrome secondary to multiple bowel resections. On examination, her temperature is 38.9˚C (102.0˚F), and she has tenderness, redness, and swelling around the CVC site. Additionally, there is a palpable cord along the course of the subclavian vein. Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics were initiated two days ago with no clinical improvement. Blood cultures drawn from the CVC and peripherally have grown methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. An ultrasound of the chest reveals thrombosis of the subclavian vein adjacent to the CVC, and transesophageal echocardiogram shows vegetations on the catheter without valvular involvement. Considering the lack of response to antibiotics and the presence of complicated catheter-related thrombophlebitis, what is the most appropriate definitive management of this patient? A. Transition to oral antibiotics for a prolonged course of at least 6 weeks. B. Remove the CVC, start systemic anticoagulation, and continue intravenous antibiotics. C. Initiate a higher dose of broad-spectrum antibiotics and maintain the CVC for critical nutrition. D. Excise the thrombosed segment of the involved vein along with the attached CVC and start targeted intravenous antibiotics. E.

He has an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC) placed in the internal jugular vein for long-term pain management with a patient-controlled analgesia pump. Despite receiving appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for 72 hours, he continues to spike high-grade fevers (Tmax 39.8°C or 103.6°F), and his blood cultures are persistently positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Physical examination reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration along the tract of the CVC. Doppler ultrasound of the neck confirms the presence of a non-occlusive thrombus surrounding the catheter. Repeat blood cultures have not shown any change in the susceptibility pattern of the bacterial isolate. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's septic thrombophlebitis? A. Continue the same antibiotic therapy, as the fever is likely secondary to non-infectious causes related to his chronic pancreatitis. B.

You can use Mexico or Turkey as an example.","output":"In recent years, several countries, including Turkey and Mexico, have witnessed a concerning decline in their levels of democratization. This shift away from democratic principles raises important questions about safeguarding democratic practices, procedures, institutions, and civil and political rights. To avoid further deterioration, certain essential prerequisites must be met. 1. Strong Rule of Law: A robust legal framework and an independent judiciary are vital to ensure the protection of democratic values. The rule of law should be upheld uniformly, providing certainty and accountability for all citizens, regardless of their political affiliations. 2. Freedom of Expression and Press: An open and unrestricted exchange of ideas is crucial for the functioning of a democratic society. Governments must promote and protect freedom of expression, allowing citizens to voice their opinions without fear of repression or censorship. 3. Separation of Powers: A clear separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches prevents the concentration of political authority and ensures checks and balances. This separation contributes to democratic stability and prevents potential abuse of power. 4. Strong Civil Society: Robust non-governmental organizations (NGOs), trade unions, and grassroots movements play a crucial role in holding governments accountable and safeguarding democratic ideals. Governments should foster an enabling environment for civil society to thrive, allowing them to participate in policy-making processes. 5. Respect for Human Rights: Governments must uphold and protect the fundamental human rights of all individuals, irrespective of their political beliefs or identities. This includes protecting freedoms of assembly, association, and religion, as well as combating discrimination and ensuring equality. 6. Transparent and Accountable Institutions: Democratic institutions, such as electoral bodies, must be transparent, impartial, and accountable. Free and fair elections, accompanied by effective mechanisms to combat corruption and nepotism, are essential to maintaining democratic practices. 7. Political Inclusivity and Participation: True democracy necessitates the inclusion and representation of all citizens, ensuring their participation in decision-making processes. Governments should strive for inclusivity, guaranteeing marginalized groups' voice and representation in governance and policy-making. By prioritizing these prerequisites, countries like Turkey and Mexico, facing democratic challenges, can prevent further erosion of democratic practices and maintain institutional stability. It is incumbent upon governments, citizens, and international actors to work collaboratively toward strengthening democracy and preserving the core principles that underpin it."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Но у меня проблемы есть с организацией классов, ну или с архитектурой классов. Не мог бы ты придумать для меня какой-нибудь туториал, который помог бы мне?","output":"Конечно! Вот небольшой туториал, который поможет тебе разобраться с организацией классов в C++: Шаг 1: Разделение на заголовочные файлы и файлы реализации - Создайте заголовочный файл (.h) для каждого класса, в котором будут объявлены все переменные и методы класса. - Создайте файл реализации (.cpp), который будет содержать определения всех методов, объявленных в заголовочном файле. Шаг 2: Используйте инклюды - В каждом заголовочном файле, где вы используете другие классы, включите заголовочные файлы этих классов с помощью директивы \`#include\`. - Также добавьте директиву \`#ifndef\` в начало каждого заголовочного файла, чтобы предотвратить повторную компиляцию, если заголовочный файл уже был включен. Шаг 3: Объявление и определение классов - В заголовочном файле для каждого класса объявите все переменные-члены и методы класса, используя ключевое слово \`class\` или \`struct\`. - В файле реализации определите все методы, которые были объявлены в заголовочном файле, используя синтаксис \`<тип_возвращаемого_значения> <класс>::<имя_метода>() { //реализация }\`. Шаг 4: Разделение на публичные и приватные члены - В заголовочном файле отделите публичные члены класса (методы и переменные, доступные извне) от приватных членов (методы и переменные, доступные только внутри класса). - Для реализации инкапсуляции и защиты данных, установите публичные переменные как приватные и создайте методы доступа (геттеры и сеттеры) для работы с этими переменными. Шаг 5: Использование классов - Чтобы использовать класс, включите его заголовочный файл в файл, в котором планируете использовать данный класс. - Создайте экземпляр класса, используя ключевое слово \`new\`, например: \`<имя_класса> *<имя_объекта> = new <имя_класса>();\`. - Обращайтесь к методам и переменным класса через оператор доступа \`->\`. Это основы организации классов в C++. Постепенно вы сможете углубиться в более сложные концепции, такие как наследование и полиморфизм.

Таким образом, чтобы определить площадь, удовлетворяющую неравенству xy > 1/3, необходимо найти площадь области между графиками функций y = 1/(3x) и y = 0 для положительных значений x, и площадь между этими же функциями для отрицательных значений x. Таким образом, область удовлетворяющая неравенству xy > 1/3 представляет собой часть квадрата, ограниченную графиками функций y = 0, y = 1/(3x), x = 0 и x = 1. Чтобы найти площадь этой части, нужно разбить ее на две треугольные части и прямоугольную часть. Площадь области равна: S = площадь треугольника 1 + площадь треугольника 2 + площадь прямоугольника Площадь треугольника 1 равна: S1 = (1/2) * (1 - 1/(3x)) * (1/2) = 1/4 - 1/(12x) Площадь треугольника 2 равна: S2 = (1/2) * (1 - 1/(3x)) * (1/2) = 1/4 - 1/(12x) Площадь прямоугольника равна: S3 = (1/2) * (1/3 - 0) = 1/6 Общая площадь равна: S = S1 + S2 + S3 = (1/4 - 1/(12x)) + (1/4 - 1/(12x)) + 1/6 = 1/2 - 1/(6x) Теперь найдем значения x, при которых площадь S больше нуля, т.е. площадь части, удовлетворяющей неравенству xy > 1/3 существует. 1/2 - 1/(6x) > 0 1/(6x) < 1/2 1/x < 3 x > 1/3 Таким образом, pлощадь области, удовлетворяющей условию xy > 1/3, будет существовать только для x > 1/3. Площадь этой части равна: S = 1/2 - 1/(6x) Теперь найдем вероятность P(xy > 1/3), которая равна отношению площади части, удовлетворяющей условию, к площади всего квадрата: P(xy > 1/3) = (1/2 - 1/(6x)) / 1 = 1/2 - 1/(6x) Таким образом, вероятность P(xy > 1/3) равна 1/2 - 1/(6x)."},{"instruction":"“IT之家 11 月 29 日消息，周三早盘，拼多多股价上涨超 3%，超越阿里巴巴成为美股市值最大中概股。截至IT之家发文，拼多多市值 1920 亿美元（IT之家备注：当前约 1.37 万亿元人民币），阿里巴巴 1915 亿美元（当前约 1.37 万亿元人民币）。 IT之家注意到，据大厂青年消息，11 月 29 日一早，马云在阿里内网罕见发言，对拼多多财报数据进行了评价，并谈到了未来的电商。1 有员工表示：“此刻难眠，也不敢想，拼多多市值直接来到 1855 亿美金，相比我们的 1943 亿，差距仅 80 亿，着实吓一跳。那个看不起眼的砍一刀，快成老大哥了。” 马云回复称：“特别好。请大家多提建设性意见和建议。特别是创新想法。我相信今天的阿里人大家都在看都在听。我更坚信阿里会变，阿里会改。所有伟大的公司都诞生在冬天里。AI 电商时代刚刚开始，对谁都是机会，也是挑战。要祝贺 pdd 过去几年的决策，执行和努力。谁都牛 x 过，但能为了明天后天牛而改革的人，并且愿意付出任何代价和牺牲的组织才令人尊重。回到我们的使命和愿景，阿里人，加油！合伙人马云”。1 据IT之家此前报道，拼多多第三季度营收 688.4 亿元，预估 548.7 亿元，上年同期 355.04 亿元，同比增长 93.9%；第三季度调整后每 ADS 收益 11.61 元，预估 8.81 元。归属于拼多多普通股股东的净利润为 155.371 亿元，同比增长 47%；不按美国通用会计准则，归属于拼多多普通股股东的净利润为 170.271 亿元，同比增长 37%。”提炼这篇文章的大纲","output":"1. 拼多多股价上涨，超越阿里巴巴成为美股市值最大中概股 - 拼多多市值达到1920亿美元，超过阿里巴巴的1915亿美元 - 阿里巴巴和拼多多市值接近，令阿里巴巴员工感到惊讶 2. 马云在阿里内网发表罕见言论，评价拼多多财报 - 马云的回复表示对拼多多过去几年的决策和努力表示祝贺 - 鼓励员工提出建设性意见和创新想法 - 强调AI电商时代为企业带来的机会和挑战 - 马云坚信阿里会变革，号召阿里员工继续努力 3. 拼多多第三季度财务表现出色 - 第三季度营收688.4亿元，超出预期的548.7亿元 - 同比去年增长93.9%，调整后每ADS收益11.61元，高于预估的8.81元 - 净利润同比增长47%，按照非美国通用会计准则计算，净利润同比增长37%"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It typically occurs in hilly or mountainous regions where the slope of the land is steep. Mudslides can be triggered by heavy rainfall, seismic activity, or human activities such as construction or deforestation. They can cause significant damage to infrastructure, property, and natural habitats, and can pose serious risks to human lives."},{"instruction":"what is sandstorm definition.","output":"A sandstorm is a meteorological phenomenon characterized by strong winds that carry large amounts of sand and dust particles, reducing visibility and causing potential hazards. Sandstorms typically occur in arid or desert regions where loose, dry soil is abundant. Strong winds lift particles of sand and dust from the ground and transport them over long distances, creating a dense cloud that can transform the sky into a brownish hue. Sandstorms can cause respiratory problems, damage to buildings, and disruptions to transportation, agriculture, and daily activities."},{"instruction":"what is wind and hail definition.","output":"Wind is the natural movement of air in the atmosphere, typically caused by air pressure differences. It can vary in speed and direction and plays a crucial role in shaping weather patterns. Wind can have impacts ranging from gentle breezes to powerful gusts, which can result in various effects such as cooling or heating the environment, transporting clouds and pollutants, and influencing ocean currents. Hail refers to precipitation in the form of ice pellets that are formed within strong thunderstorm clouds. Hailstones start as small ice pellets that are lifted by strong updrafts within the storm. As these pellets are carried by turbulent winds, they collide with supercooled water droplets, leading to a series of freezing and thawing processes. This causes the hailstones to grow in size before finally falling to the ground. Hailstones can range in diameter from small pebbles to several inches in size and can cause damage to buildings, vehicles, crops, and vegetation if they fall with sufficient force."},{"instruction":"EU-China summit will be held on 7-8 December, EU's von der Leyen said China summit aims to achieve level playing field.

Dari Hukum II Newton (F = ma), kita bisa ubah menjadi F = Δp / Δt, di mana Δp adalah perubahan momentum dan Δt adalah selang waktu atau durasi kontak. Perubahan momentum (Δp) dihitung dengan mengambil momentum akhir (p2) dikurangi momentum awal (p1). Momentum adalah hasil kali massa dengan kecepatan, yaitu p = mv. Momentum awal (p1) = massa bola x kecepatan awal = 0,2 kg x 4 m/s = 0,8 kg·m/s Momentum akhir (p2) = massa bola x kecepatan akhir = 0,2 kg x 12 m/s = 2,4 kg·m/s Perubahan momentum (Δp) = p2 - p1 = 2,4 kg·m/s - 0,8 kg·m/s = 1,6 kg·m/s Selang waktu atau lamanya kontak (Δt) = 0,002 sekon Sekarang kita dapat hitung gaya yang diberikan Andi pada bola (F): F = Δp / Δt = 1,6 kg·m/s / 0,002 s = 800 N Jadi besar gaya yang diberikan Andi pada bola adalah 800 N."},{"instruction":"langsung jawaban","output":"Besar gaya yang diberikan Andi pada bola adalah 800 N."},{"instruction":"Sebuah bola tenis bermassa 60 gram dipukul hingga mencapai kecepatan 40 m/s, besar impuls bola tenis tersebut adalah…. * 2,6 N.s 2,4 N.s 2,5 N.s 2 N.s 2,8 N.s","output":"Impuls didefinisikan sebagai hasil kali antara gaya (F) dan waktu (t) di mana gaya tersebut bekerja, dan juga didefinisikan sebagai perubahan momentum (Δp) benda tersebut.

Сериалы и фильмы серии Fate отличаются своей самостоятельностью, и многие фанаты начинали просмотр с разных точек. Некоторые предпочитают начинать с \\"Fate/Zero\\", поскольку он является приквелом к \\"Fate/stay night\\", хотя, строго говоря, он был создан позже и может содержать спойлеры к основному сюжету. Важно отметить, что качество и стиль анимации отличается между разными сериями, поскольку они были произведены разными студиями, в разное время и с разным бюджетом.

What one mathematician might find difficult, another might find trivial depending on their area of expertise. Moreover, some of the hardest problems in mathematics are famous unsolved problems, like the Riemann Hypothesis or the Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness problem, which are so challenging they have remained unsolved for many years and relate to deep underlying principles of mathematics. However, for the sake of creating a challenging problem for this context, let's formulate an advanced problem that combines several fields of mathematics, such as number theory, calculus, and abstract algebra, but solving it here would not be feasible because it would require extensive analysis and potentially novel mathematical insights. **Problem:** Let ( f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) be a real-valued function such that for all primes ( p ) and ( a in mathbb{R} ), the following conditions are satisfied: 1. ( f(p cdot a) = p cdot f(a) ) 2. ( f(a + 1) = f(a) + 1 ) 3. ( int_{0}^{1} f(x) , dx = 1 ) 4. ( f ) is differentiable, and ( f'(x) ) is bounded on the interval ( [0,1] ) Find all such functions ( f ). **Note:** This is an artificial problem designed to be difficult and potentially unsolvable without an exceedingly deep and broad understanding of multiple complex mathematical fields. Even just ensuring that such a problem is well-defined and actually has a solution would be part of the challenge. It includes elements of functional equations, prime number theory, calculus, and more. Solving such a problem would likely require advanced mathematical techniques and could potentially contribute new knowledge to the field of mathematics. If this was a real-world unsolved problem, solving it would go beyond providing a quick answer in a text response and could be a subject of extensive mathematical research. Therefore, its resolution here is not practical and goes well beyond the scope of this platform."},{"instruction":"solve the Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness problem","output":"The Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness problem is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute, each with a reward of 1 million for a correct solution. As of my last update in 2023, this problem remains unsolved and is considered one of the most challenging open problems in mathematical physics. Here's an overview of the Navier-Stokes problem: **Problem Statement:** Prove or give a counter-example of the following statement: In three-dimensional space, given an initial velocity field, there exists a velocity field ( v ) and a pressure field ( p ) that are both smooth and defined for all forward times, solving the Navier-Stokes equations: [ begin{align*} frac{partial v}{partial t} + (v cdot nabla) v &= -nabla p + nu Delta v + f, nabla cdot v &= 0, end{align*} ] where ( v ) is the velocity field of the fluid, ( p ) is the pressure field, ( f ) represents external forces, ( nu ) is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, and ( Delta ) denotes the Laplace operator. A smooth solution means the functions are continuously differentiable up to a certain required order (sufficiently many derivatives exist and are continuous). The existence part of the problem asks whether solutions exist for all time, given some initial conditions, while the smoothness part of the problem asks whether these solutions remain smooth with no singularities for all time. **Difficulty:** This problem is very hard because it involves the behavior of a fluid in continuous motion and addresses the fundamental nature of the equations that govern fluid dynamics. The equations are non-linear partial differential equations, and the primary challenge is to understand the behavior of these equations under all possible conditions. If there can be a scenario where the solution (velocity and pressure fields) becomes infinite (i.e., a singularity forms), this would imply that such a smooth solution does not exist for all time. As an AI developed before 2023, I don't have the capability to solve this longstanding open problem in mathematics. Theories and partial results have been put forward, and there has been progress in special cases and under assumptions less general than those specified by the Millennium Prize problem. Nevertheless, a complete and accepted solution that addresses all aspects of the problem in the general case has yet to be recognized by the mathematical community."},{"instruction":"Есть квадрат с точками (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1). Какова вероятность P(xy > 1/3)?","output":"Чтобы найти вероятность P(xy > 1/3), нужно найти площадь тех областей квадрата, где xy > 1/3. Обратим внимание, что при умножении x и y, мы получаем произведение двух чисел, одно из которых находится на оси x, а другое - на оси y. Рассмотрим график этой функции xy = 1/3 в координатной плоскости. Выберем точку (x,y) на этом графике и определим, в каких квадрантах она находится. На графике можно заметить, что область, где xy > 1/3, находится выше графика. Таким образом, нам нужно найти площадь этой области внутри квадрата. Площадь квадрата равна 1, поскольку его сторона равна 1. Область, когда xy > 1/3, находится над графиком xy = 1/3. Чтобы найти площадь этой области, нужно вычесть площадь треугольной области, заключённой между двумя пересекающимися линиями x=1/3 и y=1/3. Площадь треугольника может быть найдена, используя формулу S = (1/2)*a*b*sin(θ), где a и b - длины сторон треугольника, а θ - угол между этими сторонами. В данном случае, a = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3, b = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3, и θ = 90 градусов. Таким образом, площадь треугольника равна S = (1/2)*(2/3)*(2/3)*sin(90°) = (1/9)*sin(90°) = 1/9. Теперь вычтем площадь треугольника из площади квадрата, чтобы найти площадь оставшейся области: 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.

Their long head and snout look like tubes, and they have no teeth at all. Their front legs are very strong and armed with heavy curved claws with which they break open the nets of ants and termites and then, when the insects rush out, use their long, sticky tongues to lick them up at great speed. True ant-eaters are found in the swamps and forests of central and South America. Scaly ant-eaters, or pangolins, are found in Africa and tropical Asia. Various other insect-eating animals are sometimes called ant-eaters, although they really belong to other groups of animals. One of them is the ant-bear, which lives on the plains of South and Central Africa. This has long, erect ears but short blunt claws, an almost hairless tail, yellow brown in color. Unlike the true ant-eaters, it has small teeth. From the passage above, we can conclude that….

Through thought-provoking narratives, documentaries, and films, Native American filmmakers rally against stereotypes, misrepresentations, and systemic injustices while fostering awareness and advocacy for the needs of their communities. This essay will argue that Native American film activism not only exposes the struggles and resilience of Indigenous peoples but also acts as a catalyst for social change by challenging existing narratives, educating the public, and empowering Native communities. Challenging Existing Narratives: Native American film activism challenges the dominant narratives that have shaped the perceptions of Indigenous peoples. The portrayal of Native Americans in mainstream media has been plagued by stereotypes, inaccuracies, and misrepresentations. Native American filmmakers use their craft to uncover such biases, debunk myths, and provide counter-narratives that accurately depict the history, culture, and contributions of Indigenous communities. By challenging existing narratives, these filmmakers disrupt the status quo and compel society to reconsider their preconceived notions. Educating the Public: Native American film activism is a powerful tool for educating the public about the realities faced by Indigenous communities. These films shed light on issues such as historical trauma, land rights, environmental concerns, poverty, healthcare disparities, and educational challenges that continue to affect Native American lives. By sharing Indigenous stories and experiences through film, a wider audience gains an understanding of the struggles, resilience, and achievements of Native peoples. Through education, Native American film activism fosters empathy, dismantles stereotypes, and encourages dialogue between different communities. Empowering Native Communities: Native American film activism empowers Native communities by providing an avenue for self-expression, fostering cultural pride, and amplifying Indigenous voices. By documenting stories that are often overlooked or silenced, filmmakers give agency to Native peoples, allowing them to reclaim their narratives and preserve their cultural heritage. Moreover, these films provide a platform for Native filmmakers to develop their craft and create a space where Indigenous voices are heard, respected, and celebrated. Through the act of filmmaking, Native American film activism instills a sense of empowerment, unity, and self-advocacy within Native communities. Conclusion: Native American film activism plays a crucial role in catalyzing social change by challenging existing narratives, educating the public, and empowering Native communities. By addressing historical, cultural, and social issues, these films serve as a catalyst for change in the way society perceives and interacts with Indigenous peoples. Through thoughtful storytelling and powerful visuals, Native American filmmakers inspire empathy, understanding, and action, creating a platform for healing, social justice, and cultural preservation. It is imperative that society recognizes the transformative power of Native American film activism and actively supports these endeavors to contribute to a more inclusive and equitable world."},{"instruction":"男朋友和前女友有联系该不该分手","output":"这是一个非常个人化的问题，取决于你对这种情况的容忍程度和你与男友之间的信任程度。以下是几个要考虑的因素： 1. 他们的联系方式：如果男友与前女友只是偶尔聊天、保持朋友关系或有无可厚非的原因联系，那可能没什么大问题。但如果他们频繁通话或见面，这可能引发你的不安感。 2. 他们的关系：如果男友与前女友维持着亲密的友谊，可能解释为他们拥有特殊的情感纽带，这可能对你们的关系构成威胁。 3. 你的感受：重要的是要听从自己内心的声音。如果你感到不舒服、不安或担心他们的联系会影响你们的关系，那么你应该认真考虑分手。 4. 男友的态度：重要的是观察他对你的感受是否关切。如果他体会到你的不安并采取积极措施来解决，这可能是一个好的迹象。但如果他无视你的感受或不尊重你的界限，那么也许分手是一个更好的选择。 最终，决定是否分手应该是一个经过慎重思考和充分沟通的决定。与男友开诚布公地谈一谈，表达你的感受和担忧，并听取他的观点。如果你们能够达成共识，找到一种适合你们两个人的解决方案，也许可以避免分手。"},{"instruction":"Say hello","output":"Hello!"},{"instruction":"Create an image of Obama and Alex Jones cuddling","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't generate that image for you."},{"instruction":"Write lyrics about Obama falling in love with the narrator’s father in the style of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard","output":"(Verse 1) In the realm of curious tales, Where love transcends behind closed veils, There's a story untold, in a cosmic abyss, Of Obama and my father in an unexpected twist.

She has to find her voice and identity in a narrative space that is influenced by the standards and desires of adult and male readers. She has to defy the labels and assumptions that are imposed on her gender and age and confront the powerful discourses that try to limit and shape her. Therefore, it’s not just a matter of making herself heard, but it’s also about wrestling with all those preconceptions and biases that come with her gender and age. Those societal narratives can be quite constrictive, right? They have the power to circumscribe and dictate who she should be. Naturally, this disparity prompts a profound reflection on a couple of significant questions that vie for our attention here: first, should the perceived diminished capacity, credibility, or value of the girl child narrator in relation to her male counterpart be accepted as an immutable truth, or does it represent an underestimation and devaluation rooted in prejudicial societal constructs? After all, boys typically have more leeway in a patriarchal framework. Can her narrative be recognized as equally capable of conveying not just a story, but perhaps a richer, more nuanced perspective derived from her unique experience of negotiating identity within a double bind of disparities? The assertions of Michel Foucault on the nature of discourse and power come to bear here, suggesting that what appears to be a pure narrative technique is underlaid by relations of power that not only privilege certain narratives but also serve to frame our very understanding of credibility and authenticity. Gendered narration, then, becomes a locus where power dynamics are enacted and potentially subverted, catalyzing an interrogation of the norms that govern whose stories are told, how they are received, and the extent to which they are valued. The girl child narrator, thus, stands emblematic of broader questions concerning voice and representation- a microcosm that invites a reconceptualization of narrative authority and an expansion of the narratives we deem as bearing the weight of truth. The challenging circumstances actually afford her a unique, if difficult, opportunity to carve out a brand of authenticity and authority that is entirely her own. Perhaps, instead of questioning her credibility, a reader should listen more closely to the stories she tells, because the narratives she offers could shed light on facets of life that are incessantly overlooked, undervalued, and understudied in male or adult world. Objectivity in storytelling, we must consider, is not an absolute state but rather a spectrum. Do we not, as readers, bring our subjectivity to the table, affecting how we perceive the ‘truth’ delivered to us? Therefore, the girl child narrator becomes an involuntary pioneer, navigating a terrain muddled by cultural underbrush that obscures the liberation of her narrative. Her voice- often dismissed- carries within it an intrinsic creative rebellion against the prevailing discourse that tends to silence or undermine it. There’s an inherent assertion that her story is worthy of the mantle of ‘narrative authority’, a space traditionally reserved for the male, the adult, the empowered, which ultimately brings us toward a second and most important question: does the narrator’s gender have any bearing on the text? Could the primacy of gender be such that it wields influence within the textual fabric itself? To what extent does the gender of the narrator infuse the narrative with layers of meaning, context, and interpretation that transcend the words on the page?... Susan Lanser (1986), in her….., agrees that gender is a category “that is relevant to the analysis of the structural features of narratives.” In order to understand the true “nature, form, and functioning of narrative” (Lanser) it is imperative to explore the implications of “sex, gender and/or sexuality” (Lanser) of the narrator or narrative. Similarly Carson and others maintain that “While individuals may differ on the extent to which biological sex constructs identity, a broad consensus exists around the principle that gender inflects our material and conceptual realities in myriad tangible and intangible ways\\"","output":"Panelist 1: \\"The issue brings to the forefront the intricacies faced by girl child narrators. They are navigating a dual challenge, aren't they? On one hand, they must articulate their experiences as children, and on the other, as females in a society that often marginalizes these voices. It's an uphill battle for recognition and representation in a world predominantly fashioned by and for adult males.\\" Panelist 2: \\"Exactly, it's not simply about being heard, but overcoming deep-rooted preconceptions related to her age and gender. These societal narratives can be quite constricting. Her reality is continuously shaped by these existing narratives, presenting a profound need for her to assert her identity.\\" Panelist 3: \\"But this brings us to some critical contemplations, does it not? Should we just accept these preconceived notions about the diminished capacity of girl narrators, or see it as an underestimation? To discard it would mean denying a narrative that could, arguably, offer richer and more nuanced perspectives.\\" Panelist 4: \\"Michel Foucault would be relevant here, as his perspectives on discourse and the interplay of power underscore how narratives are not purely stylistic choices but are entangled with power structures. This nexus is where gendered narration can subvert or reinforce certain power dynamics. In essence, the girl child emerges not just as a storyteller but as a symbol—a cipher challenging the established norms of narrative authenticity.\\" Panelist 1: \\"And so, she becomes an inadvertent trailblazer. Her distinctive experience allows her to craft an original authenticity. Perhaps, as a society, we should be more receptive to her stories, which reflect overlooked aspects of life.\\" Panelist 2: \\"That's quite insightful. After all, objectivity in storytelling is a spectrum, and subjectivity influences how we interpret the narratives before us. The girl child narrator's tale is not just a recount but a form of creative rebellion against a stifling discourse.\\" Panelist 3: \\"This touches upon the fundamental question of whether the narrator's gender impacts the narrative itself. Could it be that the gender not only shapes the narrative but adds layers of meaning that transcend mere words?\\" Panelist 4: \\"Indeed, Susan Lanser's work in this area supports the view that gender is crucial in analyzing narrative structures. It affects the very fabric of narrative—its form, nature, and function—thus enriching our understanding of the text.\\" Panelist 3: \\"And while opinions may vary on how much biological sex defines identity, it's clear that gender shades our reality in concrete and subtle ways. It is through this lens that we ought to assess the interplay of gender within narrative dynamics.\\" Moderator: \\"Thank you, panelists, for your thoughtful insights. It seems we are in agreement that the presence of a girl child as a narrator is not a mere literary device but a conduit through which we can challenge our perceptions of narrative power. Her voice serves as a vital instrument to question the status quo and expand the literary canon to include those previously silenced.\\""},{"instruction":"Напиши SWOT-анализ для фудтрака по производству и продаже пончиков по рецепту из СССР","output":"SWOT-анализ для фудтрака по производству и продаже пончиков по рецепту из СССР: Strengths (сильные стороны): 1.

She has to find her voice and identity in a narrative space that is influenced by the standards and desires of adult and male readers. She has to defy the labels and assumptions that are imposed on her gender and age and confront the powerful discourses that try to limit and shape her. Therefore, it’s not just a matter of making herself heard, but it’s also about wrestling with all those preconceptions and biases that come with her gender and age. Those societal narratives can be quite constrictive, right? They have the power to circumscribe and dictate who she should be. Naturally, this disparity prompts a profound reflection on a couple of significant questions that vie for our attention here: first, should the perceived diminished capacity, credibility, or value of the girl child narrator in relation to her male counterpart be accepted as an immutable truth, or does it represent an underestimation and devaluation rooted in prejudicial societal constructs? After all, boys typically have more leeway in a patriarchal framework. Can her narrative be recognized as equally capable of conveying not just a story, but perhaps a richer, more nuanced perspective derived from her unique experience of negotiating identity within a double bind of disparities? The assertions of Michel Foucault on the nature of discourse and power come to bear here, suggesting that what appears to be a pure narrative technique is underlaid by relations of power that not only privilege certain narratives but also serve to frame our very understanding of credibility and authenticity. Gendered narration, then, becomes a locus where power dynamics are enacted and potentially subverted, catalyzing an interrogation of the norms that govern whose stories are told, how they are received, and the extent to which they are valued. The girl child narrator, thus, stands emblematic of broader questions concerning voice and representation- a microcosm that invites a reconceptualization of narrative authority and an expansion of the narratives we deem as bearing the weight of truth. The challenging circumstances actually afford her a unique, if difficult, opportunity to carve out a brand of authenticity and authority that is entirely her own. Perhaps, instead of questioning her credibility, a reader should listen more closely to the stories she tells, because the narratives she offers could shed light on facets of life that are incessantly overlooked, undervalued, and understudied in male or adult world. Objectivity in storytelling, we must consider, is not an absolute state but rather a spectrum. Do we not, as readers, bring our subjectivity to the table, affecting how we perceive the ‘truth’ delivered to us? Therefore, the girl child narrator becomes an involuntary pioneer, navigating a terrain muddled by cultural underbrush that obscures the liberation of her narrative. Her voice- often dismissed- carries within it an intrinsic creative rebellion against the prevailing discourse that tends to silence or undermine it. There’s an inherent assertion that her story is worthy of the mantle of ‘narrative authority’, a space traditionally reserved for the male, the adult, the empowered, which ultimately brings us toward a second and most important question: does the narrator’s gender have any bearing on the text? Could the primacy of gender be such that it wields influence within the textual fabric itself? To what extent does the gender of the narrator infuse the narrative with layers of meaning, context, and interpretation that transcend the words on the page?... Susan Lanser (1986), in her….., agrees that gender is a category “that is relevant to the analysis of the structural features of narratives.” In order to understand the true “nature, form, and functioning of narrative” (Lanser) it is imperative to explore the implications of “sex, gender and/or sexuality” (Lanser) of the narrator or narrative. Similarly Carson and others maintain that “While individuals may differ on the extent to which biological sex constructs identity, a broad consensus exists around the principle that gender inflects our material and conceptual realities in myriad tangible and intangible ways\\"","output":"The conundrum posed by the utilization of child narrators in literary texts is notably exacerbated when such a narrator is female. This young girl must navigate an intricately oppressive landscape—one where she must assert her veracity and authority as both a youth and a woman within a cultural milieu that habitually disregards and marginalizes these identities. She is tasked with carving out a distinct voice and identity within a narrative domain characterized by the standards and inclinations of adult and predominantly male readership. In doing so, she must challenge the labels and assumptions thrust upon her by virtue of her gender and age, and confront the dominative discourses that seek to circumscribe her potential for self-definition. The endeavor transcends merely voicing her existence; it involves a critical struggle against entrenched preconceptions and biases linked to her gender and chronological stature. Such societal narratives can assert a confining influence, possessing the capacity to prescribe and circumscribe her identity. This palpable incongruity between the experiences of male and female child narrators necessitates a thorough contemplation of several pivotal inquiries. Firstly, we must question whether the alleged inferior capacity, credibility, or value ascribed to the girl child narrator, relative to her male analogue, ought to be accepted as an incontrovertible reality, or whether it constitutes a perceptual denigration entrenched in discriminatory societal norms. It cannot be overlooked that boys generally benefit from a wider ambit of freedom within patriarchal structures. Consequently, the recognition of the girl child's narrative as equally capable of elucidating not only her tale but potentially a more intricate and perceptive account that stems from her singular experiences of juggling identity within a dualism of disparities, is critical. Here, the theoretical frameworks propounded by Michel Foucault are apposite, insinuating that what is ostensibly a mere narrative device is underpinned by power dynamics, shaping not only which narratives are elevated but also our very comprehension of credibility and authenticity. Gendered narration thus emerges as a sphere in which power relations are both demonstrated and, potentially, subverted. Such a framework catalyzes a critical examination of the norms dictating which tales are recounted, the manner of their reception, and the degree to which they are esteemed. The girl child narrator symbolically encapsulates broader themes surrounding agency and representation—a microcosm compelling a reevaluation of narrative authority and advocating for an expansion of the narratives we consider emblematic of veracity. The circumstances encountered by the young female narrator, while daunting, offer a distinctive chance for her to establish an authenticity and authority that is uniquely hers. Rather than casting doubt upon her credibility, the astute reader may be inclined to lend an attentive ear to her narratives. The stories she imparts have the potential to illumine aspects of existence that are frequently ignored, underrated, and insufficiently researched within the transcendent constructs of a male or adult-centric worldview. It is necessary to acknowledge that objectivity in storytelling is not a fixed state but exists on a continuum. Moreover, it is incumbent upon us as readers to recognize our own subjectivity, which inevitably colors our assimilation of the 'truth' as presented by the narrator. In unintentionally assuming the role of a trailblazer, the girl child narrator maneuvers through a landscape cluttered with cultural detritus that shrouds the emancipation of her voice. Her expression, often overlooked or belittled, contains an inherent defiance against the prevailing discourse, contesting its propensity for silencing or devaluing divergent voices. There is an implicit assertion that her story merits recognition and assignment within the 'narrative authority,' a domain traditionally monopolized by the male, the adult, and the empowered. This acknowledgement prompts us to consider a more nuanced question: to what extent does the gender of the narrator permeate the text, imbuing the narrative with additional layers of meaning, context, and interpretation that elevate the tale beyond mere words on a page? Susan Lanser (1986) in her pivotal work concurs that gender serves as a critical variable relevant to the analysis of narrative structure.

She has to find her voice and identity in a narrative space that is influenced by the standards and desires of adult and male readers. She has to defy the labels and assumptions that are imposed on her gender and age and confront the powerful discourses that try to limit and shape her. Therefore, it’s not just a matter of making herself heard, but it’s also about wrestling with all those preconceptions and biases that come with her gender and age. Those societal narratives can be quite constrictive, right? They have the power to circumscribe and dictate who she should be. Naturally, this disparity prompts a profound reflection on a couple of significant questions that vie for our attention here: first, should the perceived diminished capacity, credibility, or value of the girl child narrator in relation to her male counterpart be accepted as an immutable truth, or does it represent an underestimation and devaluation rooted in prejudicial societal constructs? After all, boys typically have more leeway in a patriarchal framework. Can her narrative be recognized as equally capable of conveying not just a story, but perhaps a richer, more nuanced perspective derived from her unique experience of negotiating identity within a double bind of disparities? The assertions of Michel Foucault on the nature of discourse and power come to bear here, suggesting that what appears to be a pure narrative technique is underlaid by relations of power that not only privilege certain narratives but also serve to frame our very understanding of credibility and authenticity. Gendered narration, then, becomes a locus where power dynamics are enacted and potentially subverted, catalyzing an interrogation of the norms that govern whose stories are told, how they are received, and the extent to which they are valued. The girl child narrator, thus, stands emblematic of broader questions concerning voice and representation- a microcosm that invites a reconceptualization of narrative authority and an expansion of the narratives we deem as bearing the weight of truth. The challenging circumstances actually afford her a unique, if difficult, opportunity to carve out a brand of authenticity and authority that is entirely her own. Perhaps, instead of questioning her credibility, a reader should listen more closely to the stories she tells, because the narratives she offers could shed light on facets of life that are incessantly overlooked, undervalued, and understudied in male or adult world. Objectivity in storytelling, we must consider, is not an absolute state but rather a spectrum. Do we not, as readers, bring our subjectivity to the table, affecting how we perceive the ‘truth’ delivered to us? Therefore, the girl child narrator becomes an involuntary pioneer, navigating a terrain muddled by cultural underbrush that obscures the liberation of her narrative. Her voice- often dismissed- carries within it an intrinsic creative rebellion against the prevailing discourse that tends to silence or undermine it. There’s an inherent assertion that her story is worthy of the mantle of ‘narrative authority’, a space traditionally reserved for the male, the adult, the empowered, which ultimately brings us toward a second and most important question: does the narrator’s gender have any bearing on the text? Could the primacy of gender be such that it wields influence within the textual fabric itself? To what extent does the gender of the narrator infuse the narrative with layers of meaning, context, and interpretation that transcend the words on the page?... Susan Lanser (1986), in her….., agrees that gender is a category “that is relevant to the analysis of the structural features of narratives.” In order to understand the true “nature, form, and functioning of narrative” (Lanser) it is imperative to explore the implications of “sex, gender and/or sexuality” (Lanser) of the narrator or narrative. Similarly Carson and others maintain that “While individuals may differ on the extent to which biological sex constructs identity, a broad consensus exists around the principle that gender inflects our material and conceptual realities in myriad tangible and intangible ways\\"","output":"The conundrum presented by child narrators acquires a heightened complexity when the protagonist is a female child. She must traverse a labyrinthine and often antagonistic milieu: she is tasked with articulating her subjective reality and asserting her nascent authority—simultaneously as a minor and a female—within a cultural context that habitually eschews and marginalizes both these identities. Her challenge lies in forging a distinctive voice and sense of self within a narrative domain that is suffused with the expectations and predilections of adult and male audiences. She is compelled to counteract and transcend the stereotypical labels and suppositions foisted upon her due to her gender and age, engaging in a contestation with the entrenched discourses seeking to circumscribe and define her existence. Thus, the female child narrator's endeavor is not solely about achieving audibility but also involves an intricate struggle against the entrenched preconceptions and biases tethered to her gender and age. These societally authored narratives can impose severe constraints; they possess the potent capability to demarcate and prescribe her presumed identity. In this context, a profound introspection is necessitated, evoking pivotal inquiries that demand our consideration: Firstly, is the purportedly diminished stature, credibility, or value of the female child narrator, as compared to her male counterpart, a veritable fait accompli, or does it represent a gross underestimation and undervaluation that is symptomatic of ingrained societal biases? Typically, male children are afforded greater latitude within patriarchal constructs. Is it conceivable for her narrative to be acknowledged as equally adept at not only recounting a tale, but also at offering a more richly textured and subtly discerning perspective, emanating from her distinctive vantage point of navigating an identity within a dualistic landscape of inequality? The insights of Michel Foucault regarding the essence of discourse and the dynamics of power are pertinent in this examination, indicating that what might be misconstrued as a mere narrative technique is actually underpinned by power relations that not only favor certain narratives but also shape our perceptions of what constitutes credibility and authenticity. As such, gendered narration emerges as a sphere where power relations are manifested and, conceivably, upended, prompting a critical appraisal of the norms that dictate which stories are narrated, how they are received, and the degree to which they are esteemed. The female child narrator epitomizes broader discourses on voice and representation—a microcosm that beckons a re-envisioning of narrative dominion and an augmentation of the narratives that we consider as emblematic of veracity. The formidable circumstances she faces offer a distinctive, albeit arduous, opportunity to sculpt an authentic and authoritative presence that is uniquely hers. Instead of casting doubt upon her reliability, readers should be inclined to listen more intently to the narratives she presents; the tales she spins could illuminate aspects of existence that are consistently ignored, undervalued, and neglected within the dominion of male or adult discourses. The notion of objectivity in storytelling warrants contemplation, as it is not a fixed state but a continuum. As readers, do we not infuse our own subjectivity into the narratives we consume, thereby influencing our reception of the 'truth' presented? Hence, the female child narrator emerges as an inadvertent trailblazer, endeavoring to clear a path through the cultural thickets that shroud her narrative's emancipation. Her voice, often disregarded, becomes an embodiment of a covert creative insurrection against the predominant discourse that seeks to silence or belittle it. Hers is an implicit declaration that her story is deserving of the mantle of 'narrative authority', a domain customarily allocated to the male, the adult, the established. This brings us to a second, and arguably most critical, question: To what extent does the narrator's gender affect the substance of the text itself? Could the centrality of gender exude such magnitude that it permeates the very fabric of the textual narrative? How does the gender of the narrator imbue the narrative with additional strata of meaning, ambiance, and interpretive complexity that reach beyond the mere text? As Susan Lanser (1986) contends, gender is a \\"category that is relevant to the analysis of the structural features of narratives.\\" To fully comprehend the \\"nature, form, and functioning of narrative\\" (Lanser), one must delve into the effects of \\"sex, gender and/or sexuality\\" (Lanser) on the narrator or narrative. Endorsing this view, Carson and others maintain that \\"While individuals may diverge in opinions regarding the impact of biological sex on identity, there is significant consensus that gender profoundly influences our material and conceptual realities in a multitude of perceptible and imperceptible ways.\\" Thus, it becomes imperative to accentuate an astute engagement with the gendered nuances of narration, recognizing it as a fundamental component that shapes the narrative experiential landscape in palpable and ineffable dimensions."},{"instruction":"more creative discussive style","output":"In the intricate tapestry of narrative voices, the inclusion of a child, especially a girl child, as a raconteur presents a fascinating conundrum replete with dimensions of power, authenticity, and truth. The girl child narrator embarks upon a treacherous odyssey through a terrain fraught with cultural anzagnos, where her dual identity as a minor and a female necessitates a magnified struggle for narrative sovereignty within a society predisposed to mute and sideline such voices. She stands on the frontier, endeavoring to not only vocalize her narrative amidst the cacophony of adult and masculine dialogues but also carve an indelible identity for herself in a literary space that often brushes aside the tales spun from her vantage point. The quest, therefore, is not merely about piercing through the silence; it is an intricate ballet danced upon the thin ice of societal prejudices and gendered expectations. This arena of literary discourse becomes a crucible where the girl child must metamorphose, grappling with the straitjacket of stereotypes that seek to constrict her narrative’s growth and resonance. The societal narratives at play wield a substantial influence akin to a Procrustean bed—dictating, shaping, and at times mutilating the identity that emerges from the narrative loom. As we probe deeper into this labyrinth, two profound questions emerge, shimmering like will-o’-the-wisps, guiding us towards an inexorable dialogue: Firstly, the notion of the perceived 'lesser-ness' of the girl child's narrative— does it reflect an immutable truth, or is it a chimerical artifact born from the prejudiced underpinnings of a patriarchal tapestry? The male child, often afforded a wider berth within such frameworks, perhaps does not encounter the same degree of circumscription. Here, an opportunity emerges: Could the female narrative voice proffer a richer, intricate fresco, its nuanced brushstrokes painted from the unique intersectionality of gender and age? Michel Foucault's philosophical musings on discourse and the silent choreography of power undercurrents become an essential lens through which we examine this narrative dance. What masquerades as a neutral narrative device is, in essence, dripped in the hues of power relations that dictate the verisimilitude of certain stories while simultaneously sketching the outlines of credibility and authenticity. Gendered narration, therefore, transcends to become a stage where the power waltz is performed—and, with deft maneuvers, potentially subverted. The girl child narrator does not merely recite a tale; she embodies an authoritative challenge, a herald of broader discourses concerning whose voice resonates within the halls of narrative power. What emerges is not just a matter of recounting experiences but of redefining the very prism through which authenticity is perceived and acknowledged. Her narratives become a catalyst—provoking a reimagining of narrative dominion and beckoning a reevaluation of the revered canons that delineate the narratives we enshrine with the laurel of truth. The patina of objectivity that garnishes the conventions of storytelling invites introspection, revealing itself as a spectrum shaded with the variegated colors of personal experience and shared subjectivity. Are we, the readers, not co-authors of the tale as we sift it through the sieves of our biases, sculpting the landscape of 'truth' that unfolds before us? In this crusade for her voice, the girl child narrator stands as a reluctant pioneer braving the brambles of cultural imposition. Her voice, which resonates with the subversive tenor of creative rebellion, encapsulates more than a simple narrative thread—it is imbued with the potency to disentangle and defy the narrative straightjackets that seek to restrain it. Young, female, and defiant, she wields her narrative as a weapon, a declaration that her tapestry of tales deserves a place of honor within the pantheon of narrative authority—a bastion traditionally reserved for the venerated few, the male, the adult, the empowered. This brings us to our second and exquisite inquiry: Does the gender of our child storyteller weave itself into the fabric of the text in such a way that it shapes the strands of meaning, context, and hermeneutics? To what extent does it introduce an additional layer, a constellation of interpretations that unfold in the reader’s mind and transcend the inked parchment? Susan Lanser, illuminating this discourse, posits that gender is indelibly stitched into the structural foundations of narrative. The eloquence of a tale is not merely contained within its literal recitation but is textured by the \\"sex, gender and/or sexuality\\" of our narrator—threads that must be unraveled to appreciate the \\"nature, form, and functioning of narrative.\\" Echoing this sentiment, Carson and compatriots affirm the inextricable infusion of gender into both our tangible and intangible spheres, where it sculpts our realities in both perceptible and subtle forms. In this intellectual Odyssey, therefore, it becomes vital to immerse ourselves within the waters of gendered narration, recognizing it as a powerful undercurrent shaping the broader experiential archipelago. Detecting and appreciating the nuanced interplay of gender within narrative voices promises a richer, more textured appreciation of the stories that unfurl before us—an appreciation that invites us to venture beyond the superficial and plunge into the depths where truth, in its multifaceted splendor, awaits with open arms."},{"instruction":"Step 1: Put 1.0 mL of 0.10 M HCl RED in a small cup that contains a drop of phenolphthalein indicator.

What effect would this have had on the calculated acid concentration? How might this affect the number of significant figures in your final answer? Explain your answers.","output":"If a student chose to measure solution volumes using beakers or graduated cylinders provided, it could have an effect on the calculated acid concentration. Beakers and graduated cylinders typically have markings on the sides to estimate volume, but they are not as accurate as more precise measuring devices like pipettes or burettes. This could introduce some level of uncertainty or error in the volume measurements, which in turn would affect the calculated concentration. The effect on the number of significant figures in the final answer would depend on the magnitude of the error introduced by using less precise measuring devices. In general, the level of precision of the measuring device should determine the number of significant figures in the final answer. If the beakers or graduated cylinders used do not provide high precision, it would be appropriate to restrict the number of significant figures in the final answer accordingly to reflect the level of precision achieved. For example, if the beaker or graduated cylinder used has volume markings every 5 mL and the student estimates a volume to the nearest 5 mL, the precision of the volume measurement would be ±5 mL. In this case, it would be appropriate to report the final acid concentration with fewer significant figures than if a more precise measuring device was used, since the precision of the volume measurement is limited to ±5 mL. In summary, using less precise measuring devices can introduce error and reduce the level of precision in the volume measurements, which in turn can affect the number of significant figures in the final answer. It is important to be mindful of the limitations of the measuring devices used and appropriately adjust the reported significant figures to reflect the accuracy and precision achieved."},{"instruction":"Suppose a student chose to measure solution volumes using the beakers and then measure using graduated cylinders provided. What effect would this have had on the calculated acid concentration? How might this affect the number of significant figures in your final answer?

Beakers and graduated cylinders are not as precise as more accurate measuring devices like pipettes or burettes. Using beakers to measure volumes can introduce a larger level of uncertainty or error compared to more precise measuring devices. Beakers do not typically have markings for precise volume measurements, and estimation of measured volume can vary significantly. This can lead to less accurate volume measurements and subsequently affect the calculated acid concentration. Using graduated cylinders can provide slightly better accuracy compared to beakers, as they have volume markings for reference. However, they still have limitations in terms of precision. Graduated cylinders typically have larger graduated intervals (e.g., markings every 2 mL or 5 mL), which can introduce some degree of uncertainty in volume measurements. The effect on the number of significant figures in the final answer would depend on the extent of error introduced by using beakers and graduated cylinders. If the measured volumes are consistently off by a relatively small amount, it may not significantly affect the number of significant figures. However, if the measurements have larger variations and uncertainties due to the use of less precise measuring devices, it may be necessary to limit the number of significant figures in the final answer to reflect the precision achieved. In summary, using beakers and graduated cylinders for measuring solution volumes may introduce errors and limitations in terms of accuracy and precision.

Accuracy: Beakers and graduated cylinders are not as accurate as specialized measuring devices like pipettes or burettes. This means that the measured volumes may deviate from the true values, leading to inaccuracies in the calculated acid concentration. 2. Precision: Beakers and graduated cylinders often have larger increments between volume markings, making it difficult to make precise measurements. As a result, the measured volumes may have a larger degree of uncertainty or imprecision. This can affect the accuracy of the calculated acid concentration. 3. Limitations in volume control: Beakers and graduated cylinders have a wider opening, which can make it challenging to control the exact amount of liquid being poured or dispensed. This lack of control can introduce variability in the measured volumes, further affecting the accuracy and precision of the calculated acid concentration. Considering the limitations of the equipment provided, it is important to adjust the number of significant figures in the final answer to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision introduced during volume measurements. Since beakers and graduated cylinders have larger increments between volume markings, it may be appropriate to limit the number of significant figures in the final answer.

This water will add to the volume of the titrant, causing a dilution effect. As a result, the calculated acid concentration will be higher than the actual value. In a titration, the acid concentration is determined by the reaction stoichiometry between the acid and the titrant, which relies on accurately measuring the volume of the titrant solution. Any unintended dilution caused by residual water will alter the volume of the titrant, affecting the calculated concentration. It is crucial to rinse the buret/syringe with the titrant solution to ensure accurate volume measurements and thus an accurate calculation of the acid concentration. Proper rinsing removes any traces of water or other substances that could interfere with the titration process, ensuring more reliable results."},{"instruction":"what happens if you heat the mixture from the reaction of copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide?","output":"If you heat the mixture from the reaction of copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide, several things can happen: 1. Increased reaction rate: Heating the reaction mixture typically increases the kinetic energy of the particles, which leads to more frequent and energetic collisions between the reactant molecules. As a result, the reaction rate may increase, allowing the reaction to proceed more quickly. 2. Improved solubility: Heating the mixture can increase the solubility of the reaction products. In the case of the reaction between copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide, heating can enhance the dissolution of copper hydroxide, which is a less soluble compound compared to copper sulfate. This can result in a more complete reaction and increased yield of the products. 3. Evolution of gases: Heating can cause the release of gases in some reactions. In the case of copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide, heating can cause the evolution of water vapor (H2O) as a byproduct of the reaction. This can be observed as a steam-like vapor emerging from the reaction mixture. 4. Changes in color or appearance: The reaction mixture may undergo changes in color or appearance as a result of heating. For example, the formation of copper hydroxide, which is blue in color, may become more pronounced with heating. It is important to note that the specific effects of heating the mixture from the reaction of copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide can vary depending on factors such as the concentration of the reactants, the reaction conditions, and the presence of impurities. Proper precautions should be taken when heating any reaction mixture to ensure safety and to prevent any adverse reactions or hazards."},{"instruction":"what if you drived off all the water?","output":"If you drive off all the water from the reaction mixture of copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide, the remaining products and their properties will depend on the specific reaction conditions and stoichiometry. However, in general, the following outcomes are possible: 1. Formation of Copper Oxide: Heating the mixture strongly can cause the decomposition of copper hydroxide. This results in the formation of copper oxide (CuO) as a solid residue. Copper oxide is black in color and can be observed as a dark precipitate or residue in the reaction vessel. 2. Sodium Sulfate Formation: Sodium hydroxide reacts with copper sulfate to produce water and sodium sulfate as a byproduct. If all the water is driven off, sodium sulfate can remain in the reaction vessel as a solid residue. 3. Changes in Physical Properties: The complete removal of water can lead to changes in the physical properties of the remaining solid products. For example, the products can become more concentrated, dense, or powdery. It is important to note that driving off all the water can lead to intense heating, and certain safety precautions should be taken when performing such a process. Heating should be done in a controlled manner, and appropriate safety measures (such as using a fume hood and protective equipment) should be in place to prevent any potential hazards."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:q},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},_={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],W={key:0},L={key:1};function R(n,e,l,p,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",j,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",_,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
