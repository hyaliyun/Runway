Je důležité rozumět tomu, že politické případy se mohou lišit v závislosti na zemi, úrovni vlády, institucích a zúčastněných politických stranách. Obecně lze politické případy rozdělit do několika hlavních kategorií: 1. Korupční případy: Tyto politické případy se týkají případů, kdy politici nebo vládní úředníci zneužívají svou moc nebo veřejné prostředky ve svůj prospěch. Korupční případy mohou zahrnovat úplatky, nepotismus, zpronevěru, praní špinavých peněz a další podobné delikty. 2. Právní případy: Tyto případy se týkají politiků nebo vládních úředníků, kteří byli obviněni nebo stíháni za různé právní problémy, jako jsou podvody, falšování dokumentů, zneužívání pravomoci a další politicky motivované nebo související trestné činy. 3. Politické skandály: Politické skandály mohou být situace, kdy politici nebo vládní úředníci jsou podezřelí z neetických nebo kontroverzních činů či prohlášení, která mohou mít vliv na jejich veřejný obraz nebo politickou kariéru. Tyto případy mohou zahrnovat sexuální skandály, rasistické nebo diskriminační prohlášení a další problémy týkající se osobního chování nebo názorů politika. 4.

Politické krize mohou být způsobeny rozdíly v názorech mezi politickými stranami, nestabilitou ve vládě, konflikty mezi různými orgány nebo mezinárodními aktéry a dalšími faktory. 5. Vyšetřování a odvolání: V některých politických případech mohou být politici nebo vládní úředníci odvoláni ze svých pozic nebo podrobeni vyšetřování kvůli podezření z trestných činů, porušení etických pravidel nebo jiných nepravostí. Tyto případy mohou vést k odvolání politika z funkce, pokutám, kriminálním stíháním nebo jiným sankcím.

Answer this question: what was the last state to be added to the united states??","output":"The last state to be added to the United States was Hawaii, which officially became the 50th state on August 21, 1959. Situated in the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii is an archipelago of eight major islands along with several smaller islands and atolls. The major islands are Hawai'i (also known as the Big Island), Maui, Oahu, Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Niihau, and Kahoolawe. Hawaii's path to statehood was a long and complex one. Before the arrival of Europeans, Hawaii was an independent Polynesian kingdom with a rich history and culture. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, European explorers and traders, led by British Captain James Cook, visited the islands and established contact with the native Hawaiians. Their arrival brought diseases that the native Hawaiian population had no immunity to, ultimately leading to a significant decline in their numbers. Throughout the 19th century, Hawaii experienced a period of rapid economic and societal transformation, with American missionaries and immigrant laborers, particularly from Asia, arriving in large numbers. The influence of these newcomers began to permeate Hawaiian society, impacting everything from politics and economics to religion and education. In 1893, the last reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Queen Liliʻuokalani, was overthrown by a group of American and European businessmen in a coup. A provisional government was established, which was later replaced by the Republic of Hawaii in 1894. The United States annexed the islands during the Spanish-American War in 1898, and Hawaii became a US territory in 1900. As a US territory, Hawaii developed a thriving economy based on agriculture (particularly pineapple and sugarcane), tourism, and military installations. However, the territory's population was diverse, and not all residents were in favor of statehood. Many native Hawaiian groups, as well as some immigrant laborers, felt that the United States had illegitimately taken control of their islands. Despite these concerns, calls for statehood grew louder after World War II, which had seen a massive influx of military personnel and investment into the region. Hawaii's strategic location in the Pacific Ocean made it essential for US defense interests, and this, combined with the islands' burgeoning tourism industry, prompted Congress to consider admitting Hawaii as a state. Following several years of debate and deliberation, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Hawaii Admission Act into law on March 18, 1959. This act provided for Hawaii's transition from a territory to a state, pending the approval of the people of Hawaii. A plebiscite was held in June 1959, in which over 94% of the voters supported statehood, and Hawaii officially joined the union as the 50th state on August 21, 1959. Hawaii's unique history, rich cultural heritage, and natural beauty have made it a distinctive and valuable addition to the United States. Today, the state plays a vital role in US defense, as well as being a major tourism destination, and it continues to be a melting pot of diverse cultures and traditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these two questions, let's break down each question step-by-step and discuss the possible solutions. Question 1: How do I call a person who has blocked my number? Step 1: Determine the reason for the block Consider whether it is appropriate to continue contacting the person if they have blocked your number. There may be a reason for the block, and respecting their wishes could be important. Step 2: Use an alternative method If you still need to contact the person, consider using an alternative communication method, such as email or social media, to convey your message. Step 3: Use a different phone If the other methods are not viable, you might try using a different phone to call the person. Caller ID might show a different number, and it may not be blocked. Question 2: How can I call a blocked number on my cell phone? Step 1: Assess the reason for the blocked number Determine if the number was blocked intentionally or accidentally. If the number was blocked for a legitimate reason, consider respecting the person's privacy. Step 2: Unblock the number If you still need to call the blocked number, you can unblock it by accessing your phone's call settings or contacting your service provider for assistance. Step 3: Call the number After unblocking the number, you can proceed to call it as you would with any other contact. Now, let's compare the answers to these questions to determine if they are the same: [i] No [ii] Yes Answer: [i] No. The answers to these two questions are not the same because the first question deals with calling someone who has blocked your number, while the second question deals with calling a number that you have blocked on your phone.

I have a new situation: Two plants of the same type are growing near the outskirts of the Jorah forest. The first plant, colored red, is healthy and has no fungus on it. The other plant, colored black, has a fungus growing on the roots of it. These plants have been around for centuries and if crushed into a powder actually make a nice seasoning to add to a meal.  But I can use this background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  What is an answer for this question: Which color plant is sharing access to its glucose?","output":"Based on the provided information, the black colored plant, which has a fungus growing on its roots, is likely sharing access to its glucose with the fungus through a mycorrhizal association.

Question: How much of anybody swear to be brothers ? Title: The Warlords Movie plot: The film is set in China in the 1860s, during the Taiping Rebellion. It is based on the assassination of Ma Xinyi in 1870. In the beginning, there is a battle between loyalists and rebels, during which all of the loyalists are killed except Qingyun, the general. Qingyun goes to a village nearby where the inhabitants engage in banditry, being led by two men, Erhu and Wuyang. He offers his assistance in executing a raid against a rebel convoy. However, a loyalist army assaults the village shortly afterward and seizes the spoils for themselves. Around this time, Qingyun begins an affair with Erhu's wife. Since the villagers are poor and starving, Qingyun convinces them to fight the rebels as an independent loyalist war-band. Erhu and Wuyang are distrustful of Qingyun, so the three of them perform a blood ceremony where, under the pain of death, they promise to care for each other like brothers. The war-band wins a series of victories. Qingyun becomes ambitious and prepares to attack Suzhou and Nanjing. However, the government becomes fearful of Qingyun's growing influence, and decides to deny reinforcements and provisions. As a result, the attack on Suzhou becomes a year-long siege. Erhu attempts to kill the enemy commander by sneaking into the city in disguise. He is quickly captured, but to his surprise, the enemy commander was already planning on surrendering, and allows Erhu to kill him in exchange for sparing his troops from execution. However, Qingyun refuses to honor the deal and has the prisoners massacred. Erhu considers desertion, but Qingyun convinces him that the attack on Nanjing will liberate millions of innocent lives. Nanjing is easily taken, and Qingyun, in return for his grand success, is awarded the position of Nanjing's governor. As Qingyun waits for his inauguration, he tries to make friends with other upper-class people. Erhu, however, has been jaded by the war, and does improper things such as handing out bonus pay without permission. Qingyun responds by arranging for Erhu's murder,...

Watching bloopers, also known as outtakes or mistaakes made during film production, can be a lot of fun. They provide a different, often humorous, look at the characters, actors, and production of the content that you find enjoyable and entertaining. Bloopers lighten the mood and allow fans to see that the actors and production crew are human, and that everyone makes mistakes. It also often showcases the camaraderie and rapport that the actors have with one another when they can laugh off a mistake together. In addition to providing entertainment, bloopers can offer several benefits to those who watch them. These are some of the reasons why people enjoy watching bloopers: 1. Entertainment Value: Bloopers are amusing because they show actors in a more relaxed, off-guard state compared to their polished, on-screen personas. Additionally, the humor and laughter that often accompany bloopers make for enjoyable, lighthearted viewing. 2. Relatability: Watching bloopers can be comforting at times because it reminds us that even professional actors, who we admire and look up to, make mistakes. This relatability can help fans feel more connected to the actors and the production, knowing that they too are human. 3. Behind-the-Scenes Insight: Bloopers offer a glimpse into the production process and show how challenging and dynamic film and television production can be. This insider perspective can give fans a greater appreciation for the efforts that go into creating their favorite content. 4. Encouraging Creativity: Sometimes, bloopers can lead to new ideas and creative solutions that might not have been considered otherwise. While the original goal is to stick to the script, a spontaneous moment or mistake may inspire an ingenious ad-lib or a funnier take on a scene. Bloopers can also open our eyes to the value of improvisation, as it often results in more authentic and memorable moments. 5. Building a Connection with Fans: Bloopers can create a sense of community among fans, giving them something to bond over, and allowing them to share their enjoyment of the content in a different way. This connection can create lasting memories and spark conversations, providing fans with a familiar subject to discuss with one another. In summary, it does follow that you also enjoy watching bloopers, given their entertainment value and the connection they help foster between you and the content you love. These outtakes provide a unique, lighthearted perspective on the creative process and help to remind viewers of the human aspect in film and television production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: The Bears hosted the 6-5 Seattle Seahawks in Week 13, who had lost five of their first six road games. The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal. In overtime, the Seahawks won the toss, and Wilson took the offense 80 yards, and threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Sidney Rice. On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season. This would mark Urlacher's final game in a Bears' uniform. Urlacher was inactive for the final four games of the 2012 season, and he retired from the NFL on May 22, 2013.","output":"How did Russell Wilson's performance, including completing 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries, contribute to the Seattle Seahawks' victory over the Bears in Week 13, despite the Bears' strong start to the game and Brian Urlacher's forced fumble on Marshawn Lynch?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's the moment every pet owner dreads - when the time comes when they have to say a final goodbye to a faithful friend. These heart-breaking end-of-life snaps are meant to highlight the special relationship between an owner and their dying pet in its last moments. Sarah Ernhart, the owner of Sarah Beth Photography in Minneapolis,  created them in what she dubbed a 'Joy Session', in which she records owners' last embrace with their pets that are too old to live or have been diagnosed with terminal illnesses. Final embrace: These special, end-of-life photography sessions are just for terminally ill or elderly pets. Mrs Ernhart, who has been a professional photographer since 2006, trademarked the name Joy Session, and began offering them in 2010. She has since had more than 100 shoots with owners and their pets. 'People seem to love the idea,' she said. 'It's getting bigger and bigger.' The service has become so popular that Mrs Ernhart has built a directory of photographers around the world who shoot terminally ill pets with their owners. 'It can definitely be very emotional,' Mrs Ernhart said. 'It's a very sensitive time for these people who have been with these animals for their entire lives. I definitely have cried with some of the owners. 'The sessions can be happy at the same time because the owners get to talk about their favorite little quirks and things that they like about their pets. I get this inside view of what these people's lives are like. It's a pretty powerful.' Explaining how she came up with the idea, Mrs Ernhart said: 'The name \\"Joy Session\\" is not something I arbitrarily chose. There's a. very personal meaning behind it, and I'd like to share how it all began. Mrs Ernhart said: 'The name \\"Joy Session\\" is not something I arbitrarily chose.

Last moments: The beautiful, yet heartbreaking pictures, are meant to highlight the relationship between pet and owner before they pass. 'Shortly. before Christmas in 2009, I had a photo shoot with a woman named Joan. Her friend booked the session as a gift, and we had a beautiful sunny. day for it. 'Joan was living. at home in Hospice care, and relied on the companionship and day-to-day. help of her Service Dog, a Black Lab named Joy. Joy was her rock, her. best friend, and had saved Joan's life on more than one occasion. 'She would let Joan know when her blood sugar was low, and if she was about to have a seizure. Joy would place herself under Joan to break her fall, stand firm to help. her up, and was by her side day and night. I came into this session. knowing that Joan didn't have much time left, but I had no idea I'd be meeting such a vibrant, funny, happy woman. Mrs Ernhart, who has been a professional photographer since 2006, began offering her service in 2010. The service has become widespread enough that Mrs Ernhart has built a directory of photographers around the world who shoot terminally ill pets with their owners. 'She. was so blessed to have Joy come into her life, and her eyes lit up with. every story she told of her. She said that Joy was her \\"gift from God\\" and taking these photos had given her something wonderful to look. forward to. 'Their bond was. palpable, and it was easy to see that both of them were very loved. Her. apartment was filled with the word \\"Joy\\" in artwork and pillows and. Christmas decorations. 'She even wore a \\"Joy\\" sweatshirt during our session.We sat and chatted for a long time. Joan's zest for life, even with her declining health, was a breath of. fresh air for me, and helped me see that what I do is meaningful and. important in so many ways. Emotional: The photographer said the sessions are for people who want to 'celebrate the happiness' their pets have brought to their lives. Final farewell: Two boys pictured saying their final goodbye to their pet dog. Last rites: An owner strokes his pet in the park before the terminally ill dog dies. 'Without. knowing it at the time, she and Joy sparked the idea to offer photo. sessions specifically for pets that are nearing the end of their lives. 'For so many people, their pets mean the world to them, and I want to. provide an opportunity to capture what makes them so special, especially. in such a difficult time. 'My. first \\"official\\" Joy session was with a Bernese Mountain dog named. Griffin, in January of 2010.

While a dog might try to grab the ripped object, this is not directly connected to the cat's destructive behavior. - Floor: While the floor might be littered with the cat's ripped-up materials, it's only the location where the destruction takes place, not the actual cause or issue at hand. - Garage: This choice is specific to a location rather than describing the problem itself. Cats can rip things apart anywhere, not just in garages. - Nature: Although cats are natural hunters and might engage in ripping behavior in nature, the act of ripping things apart in a domestic setting is unrelated to nature itself and instead indicates destructive and problematic behavior.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Ben and Andy studied minerals and micro-nutrients. Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc and molybdenum, while his buddy Andy studied about sodium and potassium.  and a hint : Sodium and potassium are two of the most important elements in living things. They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this \\"uphill\\" process. Figure below shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure  Please answer this question : Which person studied less about Energy in ATP ? Answer:","output":"Ben studied less about Energy in ATP. Step-by-step justification: 1. Ben studied magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum, which are minerals and play specific roles in various biochemical processes, but they aren't directly related to the process of energy in ATP mentioned in the hint.  2. Andy, on the other hand, studied sodium and potassium, which are involved in the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump is an essential process for maintaining cellular ion balance and function, and it consumes energy derived from ATP to function. 3. Since the hint specifically talks about energy in ATP in relation to the sodium-potassium pump, we can deduce that Andy's studies included more information about energy in ATP. In conclusion, Ben studied less about Energy in ATP as compared to Andy, whose studies directly involved energy consumption in the form of ATP."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Founded in 1764 by French fur traders, Pierre Laclède and Auguste Chouteau, St. Louis was initially a French settlement. In 1762, as part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, France ceded the Louisiana territory, including St. Louis, to Spain. However, the city was regained by France under Napoleon in 1800 before ultimately being sold to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Thus, St. Louis' connection to the Kingdom of France helps reveal its rich colonial history and significance in the territorial expansions of the North American continent. In conclusion, this data offers limited yet relevant information regarding Elliot See, an individual with an unspecified background whose death occurred in St. Louis. Furthermore, it highlights the historical connection between St. Louis and the Kingdom of France, emphasizing the city's importance as a significant colonial settlement and participant in the regional power dynamics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - The President of Iran (\\"\\") is the head of government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The President is the highest popularly elected official in Iran, although the President answers to the Supreme Leader of Iran, who functions as the country's head of state. Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates and procedures for election, as well as the President's powers and responsibilities as \\"functions of the executive\\". These include signing treaties and other agreements with foreign countries and international organizations; administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs; and appointing ministers subject to the approval of Parliament. However, in reality the president mainly gets the blame for failures than actually making the decisions. The current long-time Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has been ruling for nearly three decades, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on economy, environment, foreign policy, national planning such as population growth, and everything else in Iran. Khamenei also makes the final decisions on the amount of transparency in elections in Iran, and has fired and reinstated Presidential cabinet appointments.   - Rafsanjan (also Romanized as Rafsanjn and Rafsinjn; also known as Bahrmbd) is a city in and the capital of Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 136,388, in 33,489 families.   - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.  - Tehran ( \\"Tehrn\\") is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province. With a population of around 9 million in the city and 16 million in the wider metropolitan area, Tehran is the most populous city of Iran, the 2nd-most populous city in Western Asia and the 3rd-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East. It is ranked 29th in the world by the population of its metropolitan area.  - Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei (; 19 April 1939) is the second and current Supreme Leader of Iran and a Muslim cleric. Ali Khamenei succeeded Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian Revolution, after Khomeini's death, being elected as the new Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on 4 June 1989, at age 49. Current Iranian president Hassan Rouhani arranged for Khamenei to get his first major post in the provisional revolutionary government as deputy defense minister. Khamenei also served as the President of Iran from 1981 to 1989. In 2012, 2013, and 2014 \\"Forbes\\" selected him 21st, 23rd, and 19th, respectively, in the list of \\"The World's Most Powerful People\\".  - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west.  - The Iranian presidential election of 1989 took place on July 28 , 1989 , after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the selection of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the previous President of Iran , as the new Supreme Leader of Iran . Out of the seventy - nine candidates registered to run , only two were approved by the Council of Guardians , which resulted in a very predictable win by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the previous Speaker of Majlis .  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran was adopted by referendum on 2 and 3 December 1979, and went into force replacing the Constitution of 1905. It was amended on 28 July 1989. The constitution has been called a \\"hybrid\\" of \\"theocratic and democratic elements\\". While articles One and Two vest sovereignty in God, article six \\"mandates popular elections for the presidency and the Majlis, or parliament.\\" However all democratic procedures and rights are subordinate to the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader, whose powers are spelled out in Chapter Eight (Articles 107-112).  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.  - An Islamic republic is the name given to several states in countries ruled by Islamic laws, including the Islamic Republics of Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and Mauritania. Pakistan first adopted the title under the constitution of 1956. Mauritania adopted it on 28 November 1958. Iran adopted it after the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty. Afghanistan adopted it in 1992 (in 19962001 the Taliban was ruling as an Islamic emirate (monarchy)) upon Jamiat-e Islami seizing capital Kabul from the Communists. Despite the similar name the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws.  - Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (or Hashemi Bahramani; 25 August 1934  8 January 2017) was an influential Iranian politician, writer and one of the founding fathers of the Islamic Republic who was the fourth President of Iran from 3 August 1989 until 3 August 1997. He was the head of the Assembly of Experts from 2007 until 2011 when he decided not to nominate himself for the post. He was also the chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council.  - The Assembly of Experts (also Assembly of Experts of the Leadership) of the Islamic Republic of Iran, also translated as Council of Experts, is a deliberative body of Iran consisting of eighty eight (88) Mujtahids (Islamic theologians) that is charged with electing and removing the Supreme Leader of Iran and supervising his activities. Members of the assembly are elected from lists of candidates by direct public vote for eight-year terms. The number of members has ranged from 82 elected in 1982 to 88 elected in 2016. Current laws require the assembly to meet for at least two days every six months. The current chairman of the Fifth Assembly is Ahmad Jannati. All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), must be approved by the Guardian Council, while half of its members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. Accordingly, the Assembly has never questioned the Supreme Leader. There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly criticized members of the Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly called then-member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Ahmad Azari Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts.  - The Expediency Discernment Council of the System (\\"Majma' Tašxis Malahat Nezâm\\") is an administrative assembly appointed by the Supreme Leader and was created upon the revision to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 6 February 1988. It was originally set up to resolve differences or conflicts between the Majlis and the Guardian Council, but \\"its true power lies more in its advisory role to the Supreme Leader.\\" According to Hooman Majd, the Leader \\"delegated some of his own authority to the council  granting it supervisory powers over all branches of the government\\"  following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election in 2005.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'point in time' with '28 july 1989'. A:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'point in time' with '28 July 1989' is the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. As stated in the given paragraphs, the Constitution was adopted by referendum on 2 and 3 December 1979. However, it underwent amendments on 28 July 1989, making it the entity associated specifically with this date. The amendments resulted in creating a constitution that has been called a \\"hybrid\\" of theocratic and democratic elements. It vests sovereignty in God while also mandating popular elections for the presidency and parliament. This document governs Iran's political, social, and economic life, establishing the laws, regulations, and procedures which the country's government institutions must follow."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Jill Tarter at the Allen Telescope Array in California, which monitors radio signals for signs of alien life. Her ears are 42 large and sophisticated radio telescopes, spread across several acres, that scan the cosmos for signals of extraterrestrial origin. If intelligent life forms do exist on other planets, and they try to contact us, Tarter will be among the first to know. Are we citizens of Earth alone in the universe? It's a question that has long fascinated astronomers, sci-fi authors, kids with backyard telescopes and Hollywood executives who churn out spectacles about alien encounters. Polls have found that most Americans believe that some form of life exists beyond our planet. \\"It's a fundamental question,\\" said Tarter, the real-life inspiration for Jodie Foster's character in the 1997 movie \\"Contact.\\"  \\"And it's a question that the person on the street can understand. It's not like a ... super-collider or some search for neutrinos buried in the ice. It's, 'Are we alone? How might we find out? What does that tell us about ourselves and our place in the universe?' \\"We're trying to figure out how the universe began, how galaxies and large-scale structures formed, and where did the origins of life as we know it take place?\\" Tarter said. \\"These are all valid questions to ask of the universe. And an equally valid question is whether the same thing that happened here [on Earth] has happened elsewhere.\\"  Watch a preview of CNN's \\"In Search of Aliens\\" series ». Thanks to advancements in technology, scientists hope to get an answer sooner rather than later. Rovers have snapped photographs of the surface of Mars that show fossil-like shapes. NASA hopes to launch within a decade a Terrestrial Planet Finder, an orbiting observatory that would detect planets around nearby stars and determine whether they could support life. Such developments are catnip to scientists like Geoffrey Marcy, a professor of astronomy at the University of California-Berkeley who has discovered more extrasolar planets than anyone else. \\"It wasn't more than 13 years ago that we hadn't found any planets around the stars, and most people thought that we never would. So here we are not only having found planets, we are looking for habitable planets, signs of biology on those planets,\\" Marcy told CNN. \\"It's an extraordinary explosion of a field of science that didn't even exist just a few years ago.\\" Then there's Tarter, whose quest for signs of extraterrestrial life kept her on the fringes of mainstream science for decades. While pursuing her doctorate at UC-Berkeley, Tarter came across an engineering report that floated the idea of using radio telescopes to listen for broadcasts by alien beings. It became her life's work. In 1984 Tarter founded the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) in California. Using telescopes in Australia, West Virginia and Puerto Rico, she conducted a decade-long scouring of about 750 nearby star systems for extraterrestrial radio signals. None was found, although Tarter had some false alarms. In 1998, she intercepted a mysterious signal that lasted for hours. Tarter got so excited she misread her own computer results: The signal was coming from a NASA observatory spacecraft orbiting the sun. Today, Tarter listens to the heavens with the Allen Telescope Array, a collection of 20-foot-wide telescopes some 300 miles north of San Francisco. The dish-like scopes are a joint effort of SETI and UC-Berkeley's Radio Astronomy Lab and have been funded largely by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who donated more than 25 million to the project. Unlike previously existing radio telescopes, which scan the sky for limited periods of time, the Allen Telescope Array probes the universe round the clock. Each of the 42 scopes is aimed at a different area of the sky, collecting reams of data that are continually studied by computers for unusual patterns. Then the listeners must filter out noise from airplanes and satellites. \\"We're listening for something that we don't think can be produced by Mother Nature,\\" Tarter said.  \\"We're using the radio frequency, other people are using optical telescopes ... and in both cases we're looking for an artificial nature to a signal. \\"In the case of radio, we're looking for a lot of power being squished into just one channel on the radio dial. In the optical, they're looking for very bright flashes that last a nanosecond ... or less, not slow pulsing kinds of things. To date we've never found a natural source that can do that.\\" Signals that any extraterrestrials might be transmitting for their own use would be difficult to detect, Tarter said. Astronomers are more likely to discover a radio transmission broadcast intentionally at the Earth, she said. Astronomers at SETI, however, are not sending a signal into space in an attempt to communicate with aliens. University of California professor Marcy is skeptical about the existence of intelligent alien life and believes our galaxy's vast distances would make communication between Earth and beings on other planets almost impossible. \\"The nearest neighbor might be halfway across our galaxy, 50,000 light-years away. Communicating with them will take a hundred thousand years for a round-trip signal,\\" he said. Still, Tarter remains undaunted. The Allen Telescope Array already does in 10 minutes what once took her scientists 10 days. When the project is completed, it will have 350 telescopes that, combined, can survey tens of thousands of star systems. \\"We can look in more places and more frequencies faster than we ever could. And that will just get better with time. We're doing something now we couldn't do when we started, we couldn't do five years ago,\\" she said. \\"Think of it as a cosmic haystack. There's a needle in there somewhere. If you pull out a few straws, are you going to get disappointed because you haven't found the needle yet? No. We haven't really begun to explore.\\" CNN correspondent Miles O'Brien contributed to this story.

No British victims have been officially identified but the names of some were confirmed by friends and family. It comes as the relatives of others still missing since the gun attack near Sousse desperately await any news of their loved ones. More than 1,000 British tourists have returned to the UK, while it is thought 2,500 more could fly home on Sunday. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May is to chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee later. Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui, 23, who has links with Islamic State, opened fire on tourists at noon on Friday. Rezgui fired shots on the beach at the Imperial Marhaba and Bellevue hotels. The attack ended when he was shot dead by police. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered close to the scene a day after the attack for a rally against terrorism, with some holding candles and others carrying flags of the UK and Tunisia. Further details have been emerging about those who lost their lives in the shooting, which was described as the most significant terrorist attack on British people since 52 were killed in the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The UK government has warned the death toll will rise in the Tunisia attack. Among those so far confirmed dead by family or friends are: One Belgian and one German have so far been identified among the dead, the health ministry said. There were also thought to be Tunisians and French killed in the attack. At least 36 people were injured, some seriously. 'Only just sinking in' Adrian Evans, from the West Midlands, was described as popular by his long-standing employer. \\"Adrian was a lovely man. I've already been inundated from members of the council and other officers offering condolences to the family. He was well liked. He worked with us for a very, very long time and it's frankly only just sinking in,\\" said Darren Cooper, leader of Sandwell Council, where Mr Evans worked. Joel Richards, a student at the University of Worcester, was described as a \\"talented\\" local football referee, who had \\"the world at his feet\\". \\"He was highly thought of and will be sadly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this tragic time,\\" added Birmingham County FA. Walsall FC said both Mr Evans and Mr Richards were fans of the club, and tweeted that those fellow supporters who wished to could lay scarves at the stadium from Monday. Tributes were also paid to couple Sue Davey and Scott Chalkley, whose sons had taken to Twitter in the aftermath of the attack in a bid to find them. Ms Davey's son Conor Fulford, posting on Twitter on Saturday night to confirm the death of his mother, said: \\"Love you always Mom, I've got my teddy bear you got me tonight, Rest easy xxxx\\" Mr Chalkley's son Ross Naylor wrote: \\"I want to say thanks to everyone who has helped, you have all been amazing. One love to all and rest in peace dad.\\" Other relatives of those still missing continue to face an agonising wait for information. Daniel Welch, from Swindon in Wiltshire, has not heard from his grandfather John Welch, 74 and his partner Eileen Swannack, 70 since the attack. He said the hardest thing was \\"not knowing\\", adding: \\"We are at a bit of a loss and we can only expect the worst.\\" The family of Denis and Elaine Thwaites, from Blackpool, Lancashire, are appealing for information about their whereabouts. The retired couple, aged 70 and 69, arrived in Sousse on Wednesday and had been staying at the Marhaba. Their son-in-law Danny Clifford said news the family had received telling them Mr and Mrs Thwaites were in hospital was proved to be misinformation. \\"We are absolutely frantic,\\" he added. The UK government has warned the death toll is likely to rise because several people had been \\"seriously injured\\" in the attack. It also warned further terrorist attacks in Tunisia, including in resort areas, were possible, \\"including by individuals who are unknown to the authorities\\". It previously emerged that the gunman - who began his attack by posing as a swimmer but was carrying a rifle under a parasol - was not known to the authorities beforehand. His parents, sister and close friends have been detained by the Tunisian authorities. Many of the tourists in the affected hotels have left the country or are waiting for specially arranged flights - however others said they would stay. Thomson and First Choice said some 5,400 of their customers remain in Tunisia, with up to 2,500 expected to return to the UK on Sunday. An additional 11 Thomson flights as well as one third-party flight with Nouvelle Air are currently due to leave later. Some holidaymakers decided not to take earlier flights to allow others to leave first. Laura Hepple, from Runcorn, who escaped the gunfire by hiding in a hotel bathroom, said: \\"We had a flight booked for Sunday anyway and we decided we would stick with that, have the last day of the holiday. [We're] probably [in] the safest place at the moment with armed guards around and... let the people with families who're actually got another week left to take the earlier flights.\\"","output":"A gunman with links to Islamic State killed 38 tourists, including at least 30 Britons, on a beach in Tunisia on Friday, causing home secretary Theresa May to chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee, with further terrorist attacks in the area considered possible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices:  -yes.  -it is not possible to tell.  -no.","output":"It is not possible to tell whether \\"It's a good thing compared to how things were before\\" based solely on the availability of \\"that\\" before. The evaluation of something being good or not depends on various factors, such as the context, the implications on society, and the benefits or drawbacks associated with it. Here are some reasons why we cannot simply conclude that it is a good thing based on its availability: 1. Context: The context in which \\"that\\" is being considered is crucial. If it is associated with a beneficial change, such as a technological advancement or a new medical breakthrough, then it could be seen as a good thing. However, if it is linked to a harmful or negative change, such as an increase in pollution or a decrease in privacy, it may not be a good thing. 2. Impact on society: Another important factor to consider is the impact of \\"that\\" on society. If it leads to an overall improvement in the quality of life, education, or healthcare, then it could be seen as a good thing. On the other hand, if it causes harm or creates a divide among communities, then it may not be a positive change. 3. Benefits versus drawbacks: To determine whether \\"that\\" is a good thing compared to how things were before, we must weigh the benefits it offers against any drawbacks it may have. If the advantages substantially outweigh the disadvantages, then it could be considered a good thing. However, if the reverse is true, then it may not be seen as a positive change. 4. Subjectivity and personal opinions: The evaluation of whether \\"that\\" is a good thing or not can be subjective, as different people may have different opinions on what constitutes a \\"good\\" change. Personal experiences, beliefs, and perspectives play a role in shaping these opinions, which may differ from person to person. 5. Long-term effects: In some cases, it might not be possible to accurately assess the long-term effects of \\"that\\" when it becomes available. It may initially seem like a good thing, but the adverse effects may become apparent only after an extended period. Alternatively, it could be initially seen as detrimental, but its long-term benefits may eventually become evident. In conclusion, determining whether \\"that\\" is a good thing compared to how things were before requires a thorough analysis of multiple factors, including context, societal impact, benefits, drawbacks, subjectivity, and long-term effects. Simply knowing that \\"that\\" was not available before is not enough information to conclude that it is a good thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sadat was perturbed by Gaddafi's unpredictability and insistence that Egypt required a cultural revolution. In February 1973, Israeli forces shot down Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114, which had strayed from Egyptian airspace into Israeli-held territory during a sandstorm. Gaddafi was infuriated that Egypt had not done more to prevent the incident, and in retaliation planned to destroy the RMS Queen Elizabeth 2, a British ship chartered by American Jews to sail to Haifa for Israel's 25th anniversary. Gaddafi ordered an Egyptian submarine to target the ship, but Sadat cancelled the order, fearing a military escalation. What is the answer to this question: What city was the destination of RMS Queen Elizabeth 2?","output":"The destination city of RMS Queen Elizabeth 2 in this specific context was Haifa, Israel.

The Verizon iPhone train started rolling this week, but Apple's main smartphone competitors aren't about to be left at the station. This week, cellular carriers released details about a trio of upcoming smartphones, all of which run an older version of Google's Android operating system. AT&T announced a March 6 release deadline for the Atrix 4G, a Motorola Mobility \\"transformer\\" phone that grabbed the spotlight at the Consumer Electronics Show last month. With a speedy dual-core processor inside, the Arix can be used as a media center or limited-function PC when connected to a television or monitor using a dock accessory. Motorola will also sell a laptop shell that allows the Atrix to essentially convert into a sort of netbook, complete with a keyboard. New details about the much-anticipated Atrix came on the same day Verizon Wireless began letting current customers pre-order the iPhone 4, formerly exclusive to AT&T in the U.S. At 200 with a two-year contract, the Atrix will be among the first to run on AT&T's faster data network and carry the \\"4G\\" branding. (For 500 with a contract, you get the phone and the laptop dock; the latter is also sold separately for 500.) The Atrix, an AT&T exclusive, will be available for pre-order starting on February 13. On the same day, AT&T will begin selling another so-called 4G phone. The second-largest U.S. carrier by subscribers announced the launch date and a 100 price tag, two-year agreement required, for HTC's Inspire 4G. That info came on Tuesday, kicking off a big week for smartphone news. The Inspire has a 4.3-inch screen -- the same large size as the Evo 4G. The new device will be the inaugural smartphone to offer AT&T's Mobile Hotspot service. Having long struggled to support the bandwidth needs of its millions of smartphone subscribers, AT&T lags behind competitors in offering this feature. Customers will have to pay an extra 20 per month to use the feature, which adds 2 gigabytes of wireless internet usage, the carrier said on Wednesday. T-Mobile USA, the fourth-largest U.S. network, said on Tuesday that it expects to begin selling the Galaxy S 4G from Samsung Electronics this month. It's similar to Samsung's several other Android handsets, but this one is compatible with T-Mobile's faster data network. All three of these new smartphones, strangely, come with a seven-month-old version of Android, called Froyo. Since releasing that version, Google launched another called Gingerbread, which powers a Samsung-made phone called the Nexus S. Google held a news conference on Wednesday to say developers are close to releasing the first device that will run the next Android, called Honeycomb, this month. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you are buying a face cord, divide the depth of a full cord by the piece length of the wood in your face cord. Multiply this quotient by the price of your face cord to determine the cost of the full cord.  Remember that the depth of a full cord is 4 feet (1.2 m) or 48 inches (1.2 m or 122 cm). For instance, if Bob is selling a face cord with an average piece length of 16 inches (40.6 cm) for 90, the calculation would look something like this:  48 inches (122 cm) / 16 inches (40.6 cm) = 3 3 * 90 = 270 The full cord value would be 270. If you know the average market rate of a full cord in your area, you can compare the full cord value of the face cord you measured to that. If you do not know the average cost, however, you might need to shop around some and figure out your own average.  It might save time to call each dealer and ask for their face cord price and piece length measurement, rather than going to each one and taking your own measurements. You should still measure the average piece length of the face cord you plan to buy once you've made your decision, though, just to make sure that the dealer's measurements match your own. If the piece length offered by each dealer is the same, you can compare face cord costs. If the piece lengths vary, however, you need to calculate the full cord value of each and compare those values to one another.  In the previous example, Bob sold firewood at a full cord value of 270. If Sally sold 12-inch (30.5-cm) long pieces of firewood at 70, the full cord value would be:  48 inches (122 cm) / 12 inches (30.5 cm) = 4 4 * 70 = 280.   If Sam sells 8-inch (20-cm) long pieces of wood at 60, the full cord value would be:  48 inches (122 cm) / 8 inches (20 cm) = 6 6 * 60 = 360   Even though Bob has the highest face cord price, he has the lowest full cord value at 270. Sally's full cord value is close at 280, but Sam's full cord value is by far the most expensive at 360, even though Sam's face cord cost was cheapest (60). As such, the best value for your money would be Bob's face cord. Even though full cord value is the best way to get the best deal, there are other factors to consider that usually increase the value and cost of wood.  Shorter lengths usually cost more because of the cost of cutting and handling. Firewood cut into consistent lengths may cost more because more work went into maintaining that even length. Finely split pieces usually cost more because of the extra labor, as well. Dry wood can cost more because it has been stored under better conditions. Cleaner firewood is also more valuable because it is more pleasant to the consumer when it comes time to burn it.","output":"The article explains how to compare the cost of different face cords of firewood by calculating their full cord values, considering factors such as piece length, consistency, and quality to determine the best value for your money."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In their world, the union of humans and sea creatures strengthens their shared bond and power. Prince Eric, the handsome and charming heir to the kingdom, shoulders the responsibility of finding his destined bride from the underwater world. While he devotes himself to his duties, he secretly yearns for true love. A grand concert orchestrated by the Queen unites both human and sea creatures for a fateful night. During the concert, as the official Lyrist of Eldamora is about to pass her gift to Nerissa, the dark forces led by Malstrom, a vengeful sorcerer exiled from the kingdom, wage an attack to steal the Heart of Eldamore. During the chaos, Prince Eric saves Nerissa from a magical trap set by Malstrom. Their eyes meet, and a spark of destiny sets their hearts aflame, sensing the connection they truly have. But, before they can explore their feelings, they are swept away in different directions by the battle. The war against Malstrom intensifies, and it becomes clear that the power of the Heart of Eldamore alone isn't enough to protect the kingdom. Queen Elenora learns of Nerissa and Prince Eric's encounter and sends her most trusted advisors to help them find each other in order to solidify their connection and strengthen their collective magic. Confronting numerous magical challenges and wild adventures, Nerissa and Prince Eric finally reunite. During their quest, they fall deeply in love, realizing that they were meant to be together. However, the battle looms over the kingdom, and Malstrom grows desperate to take the Heart of Eldamore. Nerissa and Prince Eric, now both demonstrating their shared magical bond, join forces with the kingdom's armies and sea creatures to face Malstrom in a climatic showdown.

Use evidence from the fact that explosions can cause harm to an organism to answer this question: \\"If a thing is blown apart, and was living previously to that occurring, then that thing\\"","output":"To answer the question \\"If a thing is blown apart, and was living previously to that occurring, then that thing\\": Step 1: Identify the main factors involved We need to consider the factors that are involved which are:  - The occurrence of an explosion - The living organism before the explosion - The harm caused by the explosion Step 2: Analyze the evidence from explosions causing harm to organisms Explosions can cause harm to organisms in several ways: 1. Direct impact: The force of the explosion can cause immediate and severe physical injury or death. 2. Indirect effects: The explosion can lead to fires, debris, or chemical exposure, causing further harm to the organism. 3. Environmental consequences: The explosion can result in long-term damage to an organism's habitat or ecosystem. Step 3: Apply evidence to the question Considering the harm that explosions can cause to organisms, if an explosion occurs, it is highly likely that the living thing will be harmed. The extent of harm will depend on various factors, such as the size and proximity of the explosion, the organism's resilience, and its ability to recover from the harm. Step 4: Deduce an answer based on the analysis Based on the evidence provided, we can infer that \\"If a thing is blown apart, and was living previously to that occurring, then that thing\\" would likely be significantly harmed, injured, or even killed as a result of the explosion's impact. The living thing's ability to survive and recover from such harm will depend on its resilience and any mitigating factors that might reduce the impact of the explosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - An amusement park (sometimes referred to as a funfair) or theme park is a group of entertainment attractions, rides, and other events in a location for the enjoyment of large numbers of people. Amusement parks have a fixed location, as opposed to travelling funfairs and traveling carnivals, and are more elaborate than simple city parks or playgrounds, usually providing attractions meant to cater specifically to certain age groups, as well as some that are aimed towards all ages. Theme parks, a specific type of amusement park, are usually much more intricately themed to a certain subject or group of subjects than normal amusement parks.  - The Royal Court of Sweden is the official name for the organisation (royal households) that supports the monarch, and the royal house.

Djurgården is home to historical buildings and monuments, museums, galleries, the amusement park Gröna Lund, the open-air museum Skansen, the small residential area \\"Djurgårdsstaden\\", yacht harbours, and extensive stretches of forest and meadows. It is one of the Stockholmers' favorite recreation areas and tourist destinations alike, attracting over 10 million visitors per year, of which some 5 million come to visit the museums and amusement park. The island belongs to the National City park founded in 1995. Since the 15th century the Swedish monarch has owned or held the right of disposition of Royal Djurgården. Today, this right is exercised by the Royal Djurgården Administration which is a part of the Royal Court of Sweden.  - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\").

It was built between 1823 and 1827 for King Karl XIV Johan , the first Bernadotte King of Sweden . It was intended as an escape from the formalities of court life at the Royal Palace . Rosendal Palace was largely designed by Fredrik Blom , one of the leading architects of the time , who received a royal commission to draw and build the palace building after the original buildings burned down . Fredrik August Lidströmer , Stockholm 's City Architect from 1818 to 1824 , had been King Karl XIV Johan 's primary architect at the construction of the original Rosendal Palace . After it burned down in 1819 , Lidströmer also created the initial drawings for the replacement palace .

When King Oskar II died in 1907 , his heirs decided to make Rosendal Palace a museum of the Karl Johan period and of the life of Karl XIV Johan . This makes Rosendal Palace a unique documentation of the European Empire style , in Sweden also known as the Karl Johan style . The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared in other parts of Europe . The palace stands today largely as it did in Karl XIV Johan 's lifetime . During the summer months the palace is open to visitors for guided tours .  - Biography. Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers  Eskil, Karl, and Bengt  were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Article: The latest fashion in the kitchen is the food steamer.All the stores are selling them;everyone wants one.Steaming is one of the simplest and healthiest ways of cooking food.However,that cooking time is usually longer than with other methods.In case you're thinking of buying a steamer,I've done a survey about the steamers available on the market to help you decide which will suit you best. Folding Steamer The simplest and least expensive is the folding stainless-steel version. Advantages:This is a good,basic design which sits inside a variety of different shapes of  pans with the water under it;a ring in the centre allows for easy lifting and it's easy to clean. Disadvantages:It only holds small dishes.Also,if you put too much water in the pan,it will boil up through the vegetables and they will be watery.If you put too little water in and let it get dry,you will burn the pan and get strange-smelling vegetables. Steaming Pan This is a three-layered black Teflon-coated version with a lid and two double-handled  steamers,which sits on the oven ring.The brand I bought is calledNutritious Living. Advantages:This is an excellent steamer, lightweight,easy to clean,and of all the steamers I've tried,this cooks the fastest.Fish and chicken can be cooked on the bottom with rice or vegetables on the top.It's easier to store. Disadvantages:Water can boil away until the pan is dry,but if you make sure you fill the  pan up to the suggested level and do not overcook the food,this should not happen.You cannot  see the food cooking from the top.It doesn't supply a dish for cooking rice. For serious users of steamers,I recommend having one of each version.If you just want  to try it,get the folding stainless-steel type. Question: Which of the following is true about the folding steamers? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The folding steamer is the simplest and least expensive type of food steamer on the market. It's made of stainless steel and it has a basic design which enables it to sit inside different shapes of pans. It is equipped with a ring in the center to aid in easy handling or lifting, and it is easy to clean. However, there are some limitations to this type of steamer. For instance, it can only hold small dishes. Furthermore, the amount of water you put in the pan it sits in is crucial to the food's outcome: putting too much water will make the food watery as it will boil up through the vegetables. On the other hand, putting too little water and then letting it dry would lead to the pan getting burnt and the food obtaining an unusual smell.  Another point is that the folding steamer does not cater to cooking larger meals or a variety of foods at the same time — because of its size, it's more suited to preparing smaller portions. Despite these drawbacks, the folding steamer is recommended for individuals who want to try out steaming food but aren't ready to invest in a larger, more elaborate steamer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I decided to keep my hair short instead of long because the","output":"maintenance required for shorter hair is significantly less, both in terms of time and effort, compared to long hair. Additionally, there are numerous other benefits to having shorter hair that further influenced my decision. First and foremost, shorter hair is much more manageable. Washing, drying, and styling can be done in a matter of minutes, compared to the considerable amount of time it takes with long hair. This means that I am not only saving time on a daily basis, but also reducing the chance of experiencing the hair-related frustrations that often come with long hair, such as tangles, knots, and split ends. Aside from manageability, short hair can also be much healthier for the scalp and hair strands. Long hair can weigh the scalp down and put more strain on the hair follicles, which can lead to hair loss or thinning over time. Conversely, short hair alleviates this pressure and allows my scalp to breathe, which is essential for promoting healthy hair growth. Furthermore, short hair provides more versatility when it comes to styling, as it is easier to experiment with different cuts and looks. While long hair is often tied back or styled in a limited number of ways, short hair can be worn in a variety of styles, from pixies and bobs to shaggy and textured cuts. This gives me more confidence and freedom in expressing myself through my personal style. Short hair can also be more cost-effective in the long run. With less hair to maintain, I am using fewer hair care products, such as shampoo, conditioner, and styling products, which means I'm spending less money on replenishing them as frequently. Moreover, regular haircuts and salon visits become less expensive due to the reduced amount of time and work involved in maintaining short hair. In addition, short hair can be more practical and functional, particularly during the warmer months or for individuals with an active lifestyle. Sweating and overheating can be minimized with short hair, providing more comfort and reducing the need to constantly adjust or secure my hair while engaging in physical activities. Another factor that played a role in choosing short hair over long hair is the environmental impact. By using fewer hair care products and generating less waste, my ecological footprint is smaller. Additionally, shorter showers taken to wash and condition my hair result in a reduction in water use, which contributes to a more sustainable lifestyle. Lastly, having short hair gives me a sense of empowerment and confidence. For many years, long hair has been perceived as the epitome of femininity; however, societal norms are evolving, and modern women are embracing diverse expressions of beauty. By stepping away from this traditional notion and choosing a short hairstyle, I am making a statement about my independence and breaking away from the idea that my worth or attractiveness is solely defined by the length of my hair. In conclusion, my decision to keep my hair short stems from the numerous benefits it provides, both in terms of practicality, maintenance, and self-expression. Adapting to a shorter hairstyle has allowed me to embrace my individuality, save time and money, and promote a healthier hair and scalp while reducing my environmental impact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read this and answer the question In 1922, Egypt, which had been declared a British protectorate at the outbreak of the First World War, was granted formal independence, though it continued to be a British client state until 1954. British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted to join the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arab and Jewish communities. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of the Arab population in the Middle East as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency. Britain became more pro-Arab in the 1930s at the expense of which race?","output":"In the 1930s, Britain became more pro-Arab at the expense of the Jewish population. This shift in stance was due to the increasing threat of war with Germany and the need for Britain to gain the support of the Arab population in the Middle East.

Please write a short summary for the following article: NSA Surveillance Programs Are Set to Expire as Senate Meets Sunday WASHINGTON—A lapse in some U.S. surveillance activities appears increasingly likely as senators made little headway in negotiations to extend the authorization of the programs ahead of a critical Sunday evening session that is set to convene just hours before the measures expire. The Senate will meet for what’s expected to be a tumultuous debate on the legislation at 4 p.m. Sunday, one minute after the White House will begin the process of shutting down the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of phone records. The bulk-data collection program is just one of a host of surveillance programs set to expire at midnight, although administration officials said authorization would begin to lapse at 8 p.m. if Congress doesn't act. Senate Republicans are split over whether to overhaul the NSA program. But lawmakers said they had not yet ironed out the main sticking points that have left the chamber at an impasse for weeks over pieces of the 2001 national security law known as the Patriot Act. The House has already passed a bipartisan bill, known as the U.S.A. Freedom Act, which would end the NSA’s collection of bulk phone information, requiring the government instead to obtain court approval to request phone records from telephone companies on a case-by-case basis. The White House supports that measure, too. But in the Senate last week it fell three votes short of the 60 needed to clear a procedural hurdle on the bill. With the House not returning to Washington until Monday evening, the provisions of the Patriot Act are likely to expire. Although aides said support for the House bill was growing, it was unlikely to pass the Senate without modifications. Any changes would be need to be approved by the House. President Barack Obama warned Friday that any lapse in the surveillance programs puts the U.S. at risk of missing a terrorism threat and called on the Senate to act by Sunday’s deadline. “We’ve only got a few days,” Mr. Obama said in the Oval Office after meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch. “I don’t want us to be in a situation in which for a certain period of time those authorities go away, where suddenly we’re dark, and heaven forbid we have a problem where we could have prevented a terrorist attack or apprehended someone who engaged in dangerous activity, but we didn’t do so simply because of inaction in the Senate.” Mr. Obama chastised “a handful of senators” for blocking the House measure, and said he had indicated to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and other senators that he expects them to take swift action. The Senate may vote again Sunday on the House bill, which the White House and senior House Republicans have been urging them to pass to avoid any lapses in the law. “Because the Senate failed to complete its work last Saturday, passage of the U.S.A. Freedom Act remains the only viable legislative option that will bring real reform and ensure no lapse in intelligence authorities,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.) and Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a joint statement this week. “The House-passed bill is the only bill the Senate can pass and send to the president before Sunday night’s deadline.” Among their biggest opponents has been Mr. McConnell, who has raised concerns that the House bill wouldn’t require phone companies to retain the phone records information that could help authorities spot terrorist activity. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) also has suggested extending the House bill’s six-month transition for telephone companies to take over the data collection to two years. Even if the Senate were to strike a deal on those two issues, it isn’t clear that the House would accept the changes to the bill it passed easily in a 338-88 vote. The House Judiciary Committee voted down an amendment from Rep. Steve King (R., Iowa) that would have added a data retention mandate. “There’s a real risk if they start to tamper with the U.S.A. Freedom Act that they produce something that may get through the Senate, but won’t get through the House,” said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. For instance, lengthening the bill’s transition period could cost it support in the House, he said. “That kind of delay I don’t think people are going to support.” The Senate’s actions may also be constrained again by 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) Last week, objections primarily from Mr. Paul and some liberal Democrats, blocked the Senate from passing a short-term extension of the Patriot Act provisions that needed the support of all 100 senators to skip time-consuming procedural steps. Mr. Paul has made his opposition to the government surveillance laws a centerpiece of his presidential campaign and is expected to block short-term extensions on Sunday. “On Sunday, I’m going to fight to end the NSA’s illegal spying program with everything I’ve got,” Mr. Paul tweeted this week. “If he wants to wreck this thing for whatever reasons, he potentially could,” said Sen. Dan Coats (R., Ind.). Groups as disparate as the liberal American Civil Liberties Union and conservative Tea Party Patriots agree that the bulk-collection program should expire. The two groups said Friday the fact that they find common ground should lead Congress to take seriously arguments against the government’s surveillance tactics. Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, and Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder and president of the Tea Party Patriots, hailed the robust public debate surrounding surveillance on a call with reporters. Mr. Romero urged the Senate not to short-circuit the conversation by approving the House measure. Ms. Martin targeted phone records in particular, saying the Tea Party Patriots would be satisfied with the expiration of that provision alone or with its modification under the U.S.A. Freedom Act. However, the ACLU is seeking broader changes to the national security law passed in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks. “Neither the Tea Party or the ACLU has any issue with the need of the government to prosecute individuals who do harm to our nation,” Mr. Romero said. “The question is how.” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday that the only way to avoid that is for Congress to reach an agreement on Sunday. “There is no plan B,” Mr. Earnest said. “There is no executive action that the president can take to give our law enforcement and national security professionals the tools they need, all of the tools that they need, including the tools that are included in the U.S.A. Freedom Act.” However, he said, “if faced with a scenario in which they have some of these tools taken out of their toolbox, they will try to use all of the tools that they currently have to do what’s necessary to keep us safe.” Lawmakers said efforts to reauthorize the surveillance program—if it is allowed to lapse—would be complicated by a recent court challenge. “It becomes more difficult to pass a bill later if the authorities are allowed to completely expire,” Mr. Schiff said. —Isaac Stanley-Becker contributed to this article.

On Thursday, team owner Robert Kraft provided the team’s official plane to fly the families of the 17 victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and some of the students who were injured to the nation’s capital for the event, Patriots spokesman Stacey James said.      James said Kraft decided to lend the plane to those affected by the shooting after former Arizona representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, reached out to him and asked for the favor.

He was not aware of any Patriots players on the flight. Kraft was not with them.      “No report other than they took off and everyone was happy,” James said.

Some of the most prominent student activists from Stoneman Douglas were in Cambridge earlier this week to participate in a panel at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government about the gun-control movement building across the country.

What is the title of this article: The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance. Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals. An important question is, \\"do invasive species cause extinctions?\\" Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives, but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: alpha diversity) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: beta diversity). Overall gamma diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes, but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. Extirpation, population decline, and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers, by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.","output":"Title: \\"The Impact of Invasive Species on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Resilience: Examining Species Extinction, Homogenization, and Human Influences\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Since American students have been introduced into the era of the Massive Open Online Course, the opportunity for cheating appears greater than ever. The all-knowing Google search engine is within easy reach. So how can a teacher handle such a large number of examinees so far away, let alone searching out cheaters taking tests across the Internet? Using technology, of course. While special services via webcam   and cheating detecting software have been developed now, Mettl, an online company, has developed advanced techniques for netting cheaters, which the company claims are even more reliable and easier to use. Whatever small attempt to cheat, he or she will be found out. Mettl has adopted a mass of technologies on its test-taking platform, creating a mini monitoring state in an exam. Here's how it works: A test-taker signs on to Mettl and selects his/her exam from the site's library of pre-loaded tests. Facial and keystroke recognition technology confirm the person that has signed in is the very person, and the system records both the test-taker (through the webcam) and the test-taker's screen throughout the test. Mettl's technology uses the test-taker's webcam to detect how many people are using the computer. Soon, it will track eye movement well enough to sense whether the test-taker is looking away from the screen, perhaps to consult a smart phone or a friend in secret. Mettl also monitors the test-taker's screen and can detect when the test-taker has changed a computer or moved from the test. The system will soon be able to record sound, detecting whether the test-taker is talking or being talked to. If any wrongdoings are detected, the system flags the incident and reports it back to the test's administrator. This can bring any number of things, depending on the test-giver's wishes: a complete shutdown of the exam, a warning message that appears on the test-taker's screen, even human instructions from the control center. Mettl is hoping its technology will help it break into the country's big MOOC markets. Question: Which part of a newspaper does the article come from?

Context: I already gave this example in another post but I think it was a really interesting situation with an interesting outcome so I’m going to repeat it. When I was 21 years old I produced a play. It was actually my second. The first was really successful. With the second I bit off a lot more than I could chew and I got too big for my britches and I ended up with a sprawling money eating disaster that caused me to have to move to a poor part of town and to go to court with my publicist and to be in debt for a couple of years. I could have absolutely let this ruin me and discourage me. And I realized this was a very delicate situation for my creativity and my sense of hope for the future. So I said to myself one day, “let me take a walk to the park and have this situation out with myself once and for all.” Two blocks from my house was this wonderful neo classical park with beautiful stairs leading from level to level. I walked up and down the stairs and basically said to myself “this was a failure. I am having a failure experience. But I have a choice of how I look at this. And the big Takeaway for me with this experience is that I have talent and there is a big creative future for me. And I have hope. I have to slow down. I have to make sure I don’t get ahead of myself. I definitely have to clean up this mess and be patient for however long it takes . But bottom line the big take away from this experience is that I have talent and I have a future and I have Hope.” It was one of the most amazing moments I’ve ever had with myself.

(Franz) Joseph Haydn (; German: ['jo:zef 'haId@n] ( listen); 31 March 1732 - 31 May 1809) was an Austrian composer of the Classical period. He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the piano trio and his contributions to musical form have earned him the epithets \\"Father of the Symphony\\" and \\"Father of the String Quartet\\". By 1749, Haydn had matured physically to the point that he was no longer able to sing high choral parts. Empress Maria Theresa herself complained to Reutter about his singing, calling it \\"crowing\\". One day, Haydn carried out a prank, snipping off the pigtail of a fellow chorister. This was enough for Reutter: Haydn was first caned, then summarily dismissed and sent into the streets. He had the good fortune to be taken in by a friend, Johann Michael Spangler, who shared his family's crowded garret room with Haydn for a few months. Haydn immediately began his pursuit of a career as a freelance musician.  Haydn struggled at first, working at many different jobs: as a music teacher, as a street serenader, and eventually, in 1752, as valet-accompanist for the Italian composer Nicola Porpora, from whom he later said he learned \\"the true fundamentals of composition\\". He was also briefly in Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz's employ, playing the organ in the Bohemian Chancellery chapel at the Judenplatz.  While a chorister, Haydn had not received any systematic training in music theory and composition. As a remedy, he worked his way through the counterpoint exercises in the text Gradus ad Parnassum by Johann Joseph Fux and carefully studied the work of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, whom he later acknowledged as an important influence.  As his skills increased, Haydn began to acquire a public reputation, first as the composer of an opera, Der krumme Teufel, \\"The Limping Devil\\", written for the comic actor Johann Joseph Felix Kurz, whose stage name was \\"Bernardon\\". The work was premiered successfully in 1753, but was soon closed down by the censors due to \\"offensive remarks\\". Haydn also noticed, apparently without annoyance, that works he had simply given away were being published and sold in local music shops. Between 1754 and 1756 Haydn also worked freelance for the court in Vienna. He was among several musicians who were paid for services as supplementary musicians at balls given for the imperial children during carnival season, and as supplementary singers in the imperial chapel (the Hofkapelle) in Lent and Holy Week.  With the increase in his reputation, Haydn eventually obtained aristocratic patronage, crucial for the career of a composer in his day. Countess Thun, having seen one of Haydn's compositions, summoned him and engaged him as her singing and keyboard teacher. In 1756, Baron Carl Josef Furnberg employed Haydn at his country estate, Weinzierl, where the composer wrote his first string quartets. Furnberg later recommended Haydn to Count Morzin, who, in 1757, became his first full-time employer. What was so offensive about it?","output":"It is not explicitly mentioned in the text what was considered offensive about Haydn's opera \\"Der krumme Teufel\\" (\\"The Limping Devil\\"). However, it is mentioned that the work was closed down by the censors due to \\"offensive remarks.\\" This could indicate that some of the content, dialogue, or themes in the opera were deemed inappropriate, controversial, or insulting by the censors of that time. It is important to note that norms and standards of acceptable content in artistic works were different in the 18th century, and what might have been considered offensive back then could vary greatly from today's standards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What albums did the original lead guitarist for the band that had a member die in August 1992 perform lead vocals on? ?  Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Magnesium helps your body take in the calcium. In addition, it also contributes to building healthy bones. Make sure you are getting enough magnesium in your daily diet to help absorb the calcium supplements you're taking.  To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds.  Adult women under 30 need 310 milligrams a day, while women over 30 need 320 milligrams. Men need 400 milligrams before 30 and 420 milligrams after 30. An ounce of almonds has 80 milligrams of magnesium. If your supplement needs are greater than 500 milligrams per day after accounting for the calcium consumed in your diet, split up your supplement.  Your body is only able to process up to 500 milligram at a time.  Taking more calcium than you need can be dangerous. It increases your chance of having kidney stones and may also contribute to problems with your heart.  Preteens and teenagers (ages 9 to 18) need 1,300mg of calcium per day. Vitamin D also contributes to absorbing calcium into your system. Because of this relationship, most milk has added vitamin D to help you take in the calcium.  Many dairy products, such as butter, cheese, and milk have vitamin D. Fortified cereals and fish are also good sources of this vitamin.  For adults under 70 years of age, 600 international units of vitamin D per day is sufficient. Adults over 70 should consume 800 international units. To get your recommended intake, 3 ounces of swordfish has 566 international units, while a cup of milk has 115 to 124 international units per serving. This type of calcium, which is readily available, is best taken with food. It needs stomach acid to be absorbed properly, and the food activates your stomach acid. Other types of calcium, such as calcium citrate, does not need to be taken with food. This type of calcium is usually more expensive than calcium carbonate. This type is especially good for people who have stomach issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome. The same is true of your multivitamin if your multivitamin contains iron.  Your body processes iron and calcium in much the same way, so taking them at the same time interferes with the body's ability to absorb both. The same rule applies to food and beverages consumed with both supplements. Calcium supplements should not be taken with foods high in iron, such as liver or spinach. Iron supplements should not be taken with calcium-rich products like a glass of milk. These acids can bind with calcium and keep it from being absorbed. Many foods high in magnesium are also high in these acids. Therefore, while it's important to eat these foods to get the magnesium you need, you should avoid taking your supplement along with these foods. For instance, spinach, many nuts and seeds, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, beans, and collard greens are all high in phytic and oxalic acids. Whole grains and wheat are also high in these acids, but don't seem to affect calcium absorption as much as other foods in this category. Alcohol can decrease your body's absorption of calcium. On average, don't drink more than one drink a day if you're a woman and two drinks a day if you're a man. \\"One drink\\" is the equivalent of 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of liquor. Summary:","output":"Magnesium helps your body absorb calcium and is essential in building healthy bones. To increase your magnesium intake, consume whole grains, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Recommended daily magnesium intake varies by age and gender. Calcium supplements should be taken properly to ensure proper absorption, and splitting the dose is recommended when supplementing more than 500mg per day. Preteens and teenagers need 1,300mg of calcium per day. Vitamin D is vital for calcium absorption and can be found in dairy products, fortified cereals, and fish. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D differs depending on age. Calcium carbonate supplements are best taken with food, while calcium citrate can be taken without food. Avoid taking calcium and iron supplements or high-iron foods together, as they can interfere with absorption.  Foods high in phytic and oxalic acids can bind to calcium and hinder absorption, so avoid taking calcium supplements along with these foods. Alcohol can also decrease calcium absorption, so moderate alcohol consumption is advised. In general, proper nutrition and careful supplement timing can ensure that your body is absorbing the required calcium for healthy bones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: James Watt  (30 January 1736 (19 January 1736 OS) - 25 August 1819) was a Scottish inventor, mechanical engineer, and chemist who improved on Thomas Newcomen's 1712 Newcomen steam engine with his Watt steam engine in 1781, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world. While working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow, Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines. He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder. Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. Context: From an early age Watt was very interested in chemistry. In late 1786, while in Paris, he witnessed an experiment by Berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. He had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles, and had published his findings, which aroused great interest among many potential rivals. When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process. He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method. He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali, and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties. He soon communicated these results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, who was a bleacher in Glasgow. Otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret.  With McGrigor and his wife Annie, he started to scale up the process, and in March 1788, McGrigor was able to bleach 1500 yards of cloth to his satisfaction. About this time Berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process, and published it so it became public knowledge. Many others began to experiment with improving the process, which still had many shortcomings, not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product. Watt's rivals soon overtook him in developing the process, and he dropped out of the race. It was not until 1799, when Charles Tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) that it became a commercial success.  By 1794 Watt had been chosen by Thomas Beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce, clean and store gases for use in the new Pneumatic Institution at Hotwells in Bristol. Watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years, but by 1797 the medical uses for the \\"factitious airs\\" had come to a dead end. Question: How long did he work with McGrigor?. Whats the answer?","output":"James Watt began experiments with chlorine in late 1786, after witnessing an experiment in Paris. After discovering his new method, he communicated his results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, and together they started to scale up the process. By March 1788, McGrigor successfully bleached 1500 yards of cloth to his satisfaction. Watt continued to experiment with gases for several years until around 1797.  Based on this information, we can infer that Watt worked with McGrigor for at least a couple of years, starting in late 1786 and continuing through 1788, when McGrigor successfully bleached the cloth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One use of an adverb is to modify a verb. The verb is the action in the sentence, and so an adverb tells when, why, to what extent, where, or how you did the action. Choices: (i) You might have done the action quickly, calmly, or quietly, for instance. When using an adverb with a verb, the adverb often goes before the verb, though not always. (ii) Here are examples of an adverb. For example, \\" i went to the grocery store. (iii) The verb is accompanied by the preposition \\", \\" which can be used as in \\", \\" despite \\", or \\" unfortunately \\". By modifying an adverb, you can figure out where, where, why, who, what etc. (iv) Explain this sentence, \\" i got angry, annoyed, sad, frustrated, worried, distracted or unimportant when i saw sarah arrive at the scene, and i was extremely frustrated with myself after i saw her. \\" find a verb that is adjective-derived.","output":"(i) You might have done the action quickly, calmly, or quietly, for instance.

Reuters are reporting that a fourth person has been injured in the attack.      Toulouse prosecutor Michel Valet told the Associated Press there were \\"several dead\\" in the shooting. He said it was unclear whether the victims were children or adults.      French reports claim the shooting took place at Ozar Hatorah College in Jolimont, northeast of Toulouse. It comes just days after two other incidents in which soldiers were gunned down by a man on a motorbike in the same region.      Patrick Rouimi, the father of a child at the school, told AFP that a man opened fire on a group of people standing at a spot where children were picked up for the school.      The gunman, wearing a helmet, fled the scene on a black scooter, witnesses told BFM. A correspondent for the news channel said people in the area were in \\"immense shock\\".      Interior Minister Claude Gueant has ordered security to be tightened around all French Jewish schools after the attack.      Mr Gueant was due to arrive in the southwestern city later in the morning, officials said. France has Europe's largest Jewish community, estimated at up to 700,000 people.      Police in the area launched a major manhunt last week after the killing of three paratroopers and the wounding of another in two separate, but connected incidents.      The perpetrator of both attacks fled on a motorbike.      Between 50 and 60 police officers, including anti-terrorist specialists, have been drafted in to the investigation.      Senior military officials have ordered troops based in the region not to wear their uniforms outside barracks. ||||| A motorcycle gunman opened fire Monday in front of a Jewish school in the French city of Toulouse, killing a rabbi, his two young sons and a schoolgirl, the prosecutor's office said.

(Associated Press)      Police officers gather evidence at the site of a shooting in Toulouse, southwestern France, Monday, March 19, 2012. A motorcycle gunman opened fire Monday in front of a Jewish school in the southwest... (Associated Press)      French prosecutors were studying possible terrorist links but the motive for the attack was unclear. The attack shocked the country and prompted strong emotions and high-level discussions in Israel.      Concerns emerged about a possible serial killer with racist motivations, as investigators examined whether the attack was linked to two other shooting attacks in the Toulouse region that killed three French paratroopers and left another seriously injured.      Religious minorities and issues of race have emerged as a prominent issue in France's current presidential campaign. The paratroopers killed and injured were of North African and French Caribbean origin, and the targets Monday were Jewish.      President Nicolas Sarkozy rushed to the school, denouncing \\"the savagery\\" of the attack and vowing to track down the killer or killers.      \\"We will find him,\\" he said.      Sarkozy ordered increased security at Jewish and Muslim buildings around Toulouse, while his prime minister told officials to \\"secure\\" all school and religious buildings in the entire country.      Sarkozy's challengers for the presidential vote in April and May also rushed to the scene.      In each of the three attacks, the same large caliber bullet _ 11.43 _ was used, a police official said. He was not authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified.      A 30-year-old rabbi and his 3-year-old and 6-year-old sons were killed Monday just before classes started at the Ozar Hatorah school, a junior high and high school in a quiet residential neighborhood, Toulouse Prosecutor Michel Valet said.      Another child, the 8-year-old daughter of the school principal, was also killed, school officials said. Valet said a 17-year-old boy was also seriously wounded and in the operating ward of a city hospital.      \\"He shot at everything he had in front of him, children and adults,\\" Valet said. \\"The children were chased inside the school.\\"      The slain rabbi was Johnathan Sandler, who taught Yiddish at the school, according to another teacher, Uriel Torjmane. Sandler arrived here from Jerusalem last September with his wife and children, according to Zionist activist Charlotte Elbaz.      France has the largest Jewish community in Western Europe, estimated at about 500,000, as well as its largest Muslim population, about 5 million.      Toulouse, a southwestern city north of the Pyrenees, has about 10,000 to 15,000 Jews in its overall population of 440,000, said Jean-Paul Amoyelle, the president of the Ozar Hatorah school network in France. He said the Toulouse Jewish community is well integrated.      The school targeted Monday, behind a high white wall with few external markings, was cordoned off by police, who then escorted other children out as forensics police combed the scene.      One officer held a distraught girl, her face in her hands. A mother and son wearing a yarmulke walked away from the site, their faces visibly pained. A video camera was visible at the school's entrance.      \\"The drama occurred a bit before 8 a.m. A man arrived in front of the school on a motorcycle or scooter,\\" Valet said, adding that the man got off his scooter outside the school and opened fire.      \\"Everything leads one to believe that these were racist and anti-Semitic acts,\\" Toulouse Mayor Pierre Cohen said on BFM-TV.      Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told The Associated Press that the suspect made his getaway on a dark-colored scooter _ just as the assailant or assailants did in the two shootings last week.      On March 10, a gunman on a motorbike shot and killed a paratrooper in Toulouse. Last Thursday, a gunman on a motorbike opened fire on three uniformed paratroopers at a bank machine in Montauban, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Toulouse, killing two and critically wounding the other.      The Paris prosecutor's office said it will investigate eventual terrorist links to Monday's killing and the two killings of paratroopers last week.      A man who lives near the school said he spoke with the slain rabbi just before he was killed.      \\"I said \\"Bonjour\\" to him like normal,\\" said the 29-year-old, asking to be identified only by his first name, Baroukh. \\"Then he went out into the school entrance. I heard the shots and I turned around and saw him on the ground. He looked dead. But I didn't have much time to see who did it because I panicked and started running away.\\"      Sarkozy visited the school accompanied by Richard Prasquier, the president of CRIF, the umbrella group representing Jewish organizations.      \\"It's a day of national tragedy,\\" Sarkozy said. \\"The barbary, the savagery, the cruelty cannot win. Hate cannot win. The nation is much stronger.\\"      In Jerusalem, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said \\"whether it was a terror attack or a hate crime, the loss of life is unacceptable.\\"      Einat Wilf, an Israeli legislator from the Independence Party, said legislators were being briefed on the shooting.      Special prayers were being offered Monday at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and a minute of silence in all French schools was to be held Tuesday. A carnival in Toulouse was canceled and vigils were planned in Toulouse and Paris to honor the victims.      ___      Elaine Ganley and Thomas Adamson and Sarah DiLorenzo in Paris and Amy Teibel in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ||||| School Shooting Gun Same As Other Attacks      To view this content you need Flash and Javascript enabled in your browser. Please download Flash from the Adobe download website.      A shooting at a Jewish school in France was carried out with the same stolen scooter and same gun used in two earlier attacks.      A religious education teacher, his two sons, aged three and six, and a 10-year-old girl all died in the attack at the Ozar Hatorah school in Jolimont, Toulouse, on Monday morning.      A 17-year-old boy was also seriously injured in the shooting, which was carried out by a gunman riding a scooter.      The teacher has been named by his family as Jonathan Sandler, an Israeli-French dual citizen originally from Jerusalem who moved to France last September.      The attack bore strong similarities to two shootings in the same region earlier this month, in which three French soldiers were shot dead by a gunman riding a scooter.      Victim Jonathan Sandler (Picture courtesy of Aaron Getz)      The killer was wearing a full face helmet and escaped on what police said was a 500cc Yamaha TMAX scooter stolen in Toulouse earlier this month.      A French police official said the same large calibre pistol was used in all three attacks. French prosecutors are studying possible terrorist links but any potential motive remains unclear.      French president Nicolas Sarkozy has ordered the terror alert in the southwestern region to be raised to the highest level.      Mr Sarkozy said he was \\"sure\\" the same gunman was behind the three attacks and that it was \\"obvious\\" Monday's event was anti-Semitic.      Parent: A mad man is on the loose      He added that he was suspending his re-election campaign until at least Wednesday.      Earlier Toulouse prosecutor Michel Valet described what happened: \\"A man arrived in front of the school on a motorcycle or scooter. He got off and when he was directly outside the building shot at everyone, children and adults alike.\\"      A resident who lives near the school said he spoke to Mr Sandler just before he was mown down.      \\"I said 'bonjour' to him like normal then he went out into the school entrance,\\" said Baroukh, 29. \\"I heard the shots and I turned around and saw him on the ground. He looked dead but I didn't have much time to see who did it because I panicked and started running away.\\"      Forensics at work at the Ozar Hatorah Jewish school in Toulouse      A six-year-old schoolgirl called Alexia said: \\"I came to the school this morning for prayers. Five minutes later we heard shots and we were very afraid. We were gathered in a room and prayed together while we waited for our parents.\\"      Mr Sarkozy rushed to the scene, where he described the attack as \\"barbaric\\" and vowed that the killer would be caught.      \\"Today is a day of national tragedy because children have been assassinated in cold blood. This tragedy affects the national community as a whole,\\" he said.      His main rival in the presidential election battle, Francois Hollande, said: \\"This act, whose anti-Semitic nature is as obvious as it is despicable, hits what families hold most dear - their children, and plunges the entire nation into mourning.\\"      In the earlier attacks, three soldiers were killed and another seriously wounded by a gunman wearing black and riding a high-speed scooter or motorbike.      On March 11, a 30-year-old non-commissioned officer dressed in civilian clothes was shot at point-blank range by an assailant using a 9mm gun.      president sarkozy: this terror cannot win      Four days later, two paratroopers were killed and another seriously injured at a cash machine outside their barracks in Montauban around 30 miles (50km) from Toulouse.      Witnesses said the motorcyclist walked up to the men, who were in uniform but unarmed, and opened fire at point blank range.      He apparently had time to turn over one of the wounded men who was trying to crawl away and fire three more shots before returning to his scooter and fleeing.      Police forensic experts said on Friday that the same pistol was used in both attacks and officers have said the same calibre weapon was used at the school.      French media reported that the paratroopers involved were of Arab origin.      Before the third attack, a major manhunt was already under way and between 50 and 60 police officers including anti-terrorist specialists were working on the investigation.      Senior military officials have also instructed troops based in the region not to wear their uniforms outside barracks.      French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has said there is no evidence yet to suggest the soldiers had been killed because of their service in Afghanistan.      After Monday's tragedy, France initially ordered security to be tightened around all of its Jewish schools. Within hours, it widened the move to include all religious buildings.      A formal link between the attacks has not yet been established but the three investigations have now been taken over by Parisian authorities.      Prosecutor Francois Molins said: \\"Paris prosecutors have taken over three probes into murder and attempted murder carried out as part of a terrorist enterprise.\\"      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the killings as a \\"despicable murder\\".      \\"It is too early to determine exactly what the background to the murderous act was, but we certainly cannot rule out the option that it was motivated by violent and murderous anti-Semitism,\\" the leader said.      So far, little evidence has been left at the scene of any of the shootings. No finger prints or traces of DNA have yet been recovered. Read Sam Kiley's piece on the manhunt      Sky's defence and security editor Sam Kiley said there was a clear pattern despite the shift from attacking the military to Jewish targets.      He said: \\"All of these shootings have been in the Toulouse area. Police have already made that connection. They have sent down counter-terrorist specialists.      \\"They will be focusing their attention on Islamic groups and on the weapon being used, which given these are quick drive-by shootings is likely to be an Uzi or a Scorpion - a small machine-gun with very high, rapid fire.\\"      A minute's silence will be held in all French schools at 11am Tuesday in memory of the victims.      France has the largest Jewish community and the largest Muslim population in western Europe, with around 500,000 and around 5 million respectively. |||||Summary:","output":"A very sad event happened at a Jewish school in Toulouse, France.

The city of Xiang Fan I live in isn't large and I live better. Non-imported  foods are very cheap, so are clothing and articles of everyday use. The cost of public transportation is very low, too. Chinese value education. However, it is reported that many children can't afford the expenses of schooling and are forced to leave school in some poor area in China. But they organized Project Hope many years age. It creates conditions for the poor children to go back to school. In my opinion, Project Hope is of great importance to the development of the rural education. When we read news of China in the west, rarely, if ever, will we see anything mentioned of the positive changes China has gone through. While it is true that economic miracles have not reached many areas of China, but we also have the same problems. When I am asked which country I consider better. China or the US, my answer has always been the same, \\"We are not worse or better than each other, we are only different.\\" Question: In the author's eyes,  _  .

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In the year AD 140, twenty years after the Ninth Legion disappeared in the north of Britain, Marcus Flavius Aquila, a young Roman centurion, arrives in Roman Britain to serve at his first post as a garrison commander. Marcus's father disappeared with the eagle standard of the ill-fated legion, and Marcus hopes to redeem his family's honour by bravely serving in Britain. Shortly afterwards, only Marcus's alertness and decisiveness save the garrison from being overrun by Celtic tribesmen. He is decorated for his bravery but honourably discharged due to a severe leg injury. Living at his uncle's estate near Calleva (modern Silchester) in southern Britain, Marcus has to cope with his military career having been cut short and his father's name still being held in disrepute. Hearing rumours that the eagle standard has been seen in the north of Britain, Aquila decides to recover it. Despite the warnings of his uncle and his fellow Romans, who believe that no Roman can survive north of Hadrian's Wall, he travels north into the territory of the Picts, accompanied only by his slave, Esca. The son of a deceased chieftain of the Brigantes, Esca detests Rome and what it stands for, but considers himself bound to Marcus, who saved his life during an amphitheatre show. After several weeks of travelling through the northern wilderness, Esca and Marcus encounter Guern, a Roman born Lucius Caius Metellus, one of the survivors of the Ninth Legion, who attributes his survival to the hospitality of the Selgovae tribe. Guern recalls that all but a small number of deserters were killed in an ambush by the northern tribes â including Esca's Brigantes â and that the eagle standard was taken away by the Seal People, the most vicious of the tribes.

Ratt is an American heavy metal band that had significant commercial success in the 1980s, with their albums having been certified as gold, platinum, and multi-platinum by the RIAA. The group is perhaps best known for hit singles such as \\"Round and Round\\" and \\"Lay It Down\\", tracks that ranked on Billboard's top 40 at No. 12 and No. 40, respectively, as well as other songs such as \\"Wanted Man\\", \\"You're in Love\\" and \\"Dance\\". The self-titled independent EP was well-received and brought the band to the attention of Atlantic Records which signed them. Ratt immediately started writing and recording their first full-length album. Out of the Cellar was released in March 1984 and was praised by both fans and critics. Pearcy's raspy yet bluesy vocals were noted for melding with the pyrotechnic guitar playing of twin leads Crosby and DeMartini, combining the then-prevalent Van Halen and Aerosmith-influenced bravado elements with the then-novel muted, staccato guitar-picking style of Judas Priest. Tawny Kitaen, who was previously in a relationship with Crosby, agreed to appear on the cover of their debut full-length album. She also appeared in their video for \\"Back for More\\" and on their EP from the previous year.  The album scored much radio and MTV play with songs like \\"Round and Round\\" (which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart), \\"Wanted Man\\", \\"Back for More\\", and \\"Lack of Communication\\". Their music videos exposed them to an excited teen audience first tuning into the then fledgling MTV cable network. Milton Berle's guest appearance, dressed in his Uncle Miltie drag character, in the video for \\"Round and Round\\" helped draw even more attention to the band.  Out of the Cellar became a commercial success, going platinum many times over in the United States, as well as making Ratt stars at home and in the Far East. The album release was capped off by a successful world tour that saw the band sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide, sharing the stage with such acts as Billy Squier, Ozzy Osbourne, Blackfoot, Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, Twisted Sister and Lita Ford. Out of the Cellar is today widely regarded as the band's best work and a definitive moment in 80s heavy metal, while \\"Round and Round\\" scored at No. 61 on VH1's Greatest Hard Rock Songs Show. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they have any hit singles?","output":"Yes, Ratt had hit singles.

This special day enables people to engage in activities that bring them joy, satisfaction, and peace. Although a \\"Me\\" day is highly personalized and varies from person to person, there are some common activities and self-care practices that many would likely consider during such a day: 1. Sleep in: One essential part of a \\"Me\\" day is allowing oneself to sleep in, get adequate rest, and wake up naturally without the pressure of an alarm or any obligations. 2. Enjoy a leisurely breakfast: Cooking a delicious, lavish breakfast and enjoying it slowly, perhaps with a favorite newspaper, magazine, or show, is a luxury often overlooked in daily routines. 3. Indulge in self-care routines: Spa-like treatments such as facial masks, manicures, pedicures, or bubble baths can provide both relaxation and physical rejuvenation. 4. Exercise: Engaging in a favorite form of exercise – be it yoga, swimming, running or brisk walking – can release endorphins, boost mood, and keep the body energized. 5. Spend time outdoors: Taking a leisurely walk or hike in nature, relaxing on the beach, or simply basking in the sun can offer the opportunity to reconnect with the environment and enjoy the fresh air. 6. Meditate, journal, or practice mindfulness: Setting aside quiet time to meditate, journal, or practice mindfulness can help to refocus the mind, reduce stress, and foster appreciation for the present moment. 7. Engage in creative pursuits: Activities like painting, drawing, writing, or playing a musical instrument can be both enjoyable and excellent ways to express emotions and tap into one's artistic side. 8. Read or watch movies: Settling down with a favorite book, movie, or television show can offer a welcome opportunity to unwind and escape into different worlds. 9.

Progressive coronary dilatation was defined for those with progressive enlargement of coronary arteries in 3 consecutive echocardiograms.', 'We studied 27 patients with KD with giant aneurysms (≧ 8 mm) and 51 patients with KD with medium aneurysms (4-8 mm). All the giant and 43.1% of medium aneurysms persisted during the study period. For the patients with giant aneurysms, their 10-year freedom from acute myocardial infarction/cardiovascular death and all ischemia was 66% and 52%, respectively. The median intervals for the aneurysm diameters reaching their peak were 3.3 months (giant) and 0.25 months (medium), respectively. In patients with giant aneurysms, the 10-year freedom from ischemia was much lower in those with progressive coronary dilatation (28% vs 59%, P = .021). In patients with medium aneurysms, the probability of 5-year persistence of aneurysm was much greater (67.2% vs 14.8%, P < 10(-3)) in those with progressive coronary dilatation. Male sex and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy were not associated with the late outcomes in the patients with KD who had aneurysms larger than 4 mm.

This mix of the sacred and the profane upset the Vatican and resulted in the Pepsi commercial withdrawal. In 2003, MTV named her \\"The Greatest Music Video Star Ever\\" and said that \\"Madonna's innovation, creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award.\\"\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The music video \\"Like a Prayer\\" was disliked by the Vatican and resulted in a withdrawal of a Pepsi commercial featuring the same song. The video features a mix of sacred and profane symbolism, which was a source of controversy. It includes scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a statue of a black saint, and her singing in front of burning crosses. The Catholic Church found these themes objectionable, most likely considering them a disrespectful blending of religious elements with secular and sexual imagery. The portrayal of religious icons in the music video, especially juxtaposed with secular elements, clashed with the Church's strict interpretation and respect for religious symbols and rituals. Furthermore, some academics have suggested that Madonna's videos, including \\"Like a Prayer\\", subvert traditionally established gender roles, thereby creating a further source of potential tension, not just with the Church, but also with other institutions and individuals who adhere to traditional gender norms. They note that Madonna often portrays males as the non-dominant sex, thereby reversing their expected roles. This daring approach could have provoked dissatisfaction among conservative audiences. Overall, the reaction to \\"Like a Prayer\\" reflects ongoing debates in popular culture about the intersections of religion, sex, art, and societal norms. Despite the controversy or perhaps partly because of it, Madonna's influence has been significant and enduring. In 2003, MTV named her \\"The Greatest Music Video Star Ever\\", citing her innovation and contribution to the art form."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Who is the creator and writer of all the movies in the Chucky and Child's Play horror franchise? Answer:","output":"The creator and writer of all the movies in the Chucky and Child's Play horror franchise is Don Mancini. Born in 1963 as D.T. Mancini, Don Mancini is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter, best known for bringing the iconic killer doll, Chucky, to life. Don Mancini created the character of Chucky and wrote the story that later became the basis for the seven Child's Play franchise movies, starting with the original film, Child's Play (1988), directed by Tom Holland. Following the original movie, Mancini continued to expand the Chucky universe, writing the screenplays for its sequels; Child's Play 2 (1990), directed by John Lafia, Child's Play 3 (1991), directed by Jack Bender, and Bride of Chucky (1998), directed by Ronny Yu. The series saw a shift in tone with Bride of Chucky and its sequel, Seed of Chucky (2004), both of which incorporated more humor and satire, with Mancini not only writing but also making his directorial debut in Seed of Chucky. In 2013, Mancini returned to a more horror-focused tone with the direct-to-video release, Curse of Chucky, which he wrote and directed, bridging the narratives from the earlier films and continuing to build upon the Chucky mythology. In 2017, Mancini once again sat in the director's chair and penned the screenplay for the seventh installment, Cult of Chucky. Apart from the movies, Don Mancini has also been instrumental in the development of a television series titled Chucky, which premiered in October 2021. He is the creator and showrunner of the series, maintaining his integral role in the franchise's narrative and direction, ensuring consistency in tone, and staying true to the character he brought to life over three decades ago. In summary, the creator and writer of all the movies and the television series in the Chucky and Child's Play horror franchise is Don Mancini, the talented artist behind the enduring and chilling legacy of the iconic killer doll."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Most Japanese people dress fairly similarly to westerners so you won’t have to worry about buying specific clothes for your trip. However, Japanese culture places a slightly higher premium on professional attire in public places than exists in the west. Err towards packing and wearing your nicer clothing.  Adult men generally don’t wear shorts in Japan, even in hotter weather.  Expectations for women to dress modestly are slightly higher in Japan than in the west. Japanese women usually cover their shoulders and avoid form-fitting clothes. However, this expectation is less present in major cities like Tokyo.  Flip-flops are not commonly worn in public in Japan. It won’t be considered rude but you may get strange looks. Body language signals are more intentional and universally understood in Japan than in most western cultures. A subtle nod, smile or placement of your hands can drastically change the meaning of your words. While Japanese people used to dealing with westerners will understand if you haven’t totally mastered these signals, there are some body language signals that could be considered rude.  Try to keep your back straight at all times. Slouching while sitting or leaning against a wall while standing is considered rude and dismissive of your companions.  Don’t keep your hands in your pockets during a conversation. Point with your hand, not your finger. Pointing with a finger can be considered as an insult or even a threat. Japanese people are very conscientious about spreading germs. This is especially true in major cities like Tokyo because a lot of public places are very crowded and contagious illness can spread easily.  Don’t blow your nose in public places. Find a bathroom instead. Cough into the crook of your arm rather than your hand so you cover more of your mouth. If you have a cold, wearing a surgical mask so you don’t get others sick is considered polite. Japanese people generally like to leave a bit more space between them during conversations. Try to leave enough space so that if both conversants were to bow at the same time, there would be no risk of bumping heads. Touching is generally discouraged and can be perceived as overly familiar or aggressive. This includes common and benign western actions like patting someone’s shoulder. Bowing is the most common form of nonverbal communication. While bowing conventions are fairly elaborate, using two types of bows should suffice for a visitor.  A deep bow is often used when apologizing or meeting someone of a higher station. Keep your legs and back straight and bend at the waist. Bend far enough so that your face is pointing toward the floor and hold the position for at least 2 full seconds before returning to the upright position.  You should definitely perform a deep bow for an employer or anyone you deem to be particularly prestigious. Anyone that is substantially older than you is considered to be of higher station as well.  A smaller bow is considered, to some extent, the equivalent of a handshake. Keep your legs and back straight and bend at the waist and return to your starting position quickly. It is proper for meeting people of similar age or station.","output":"This article highlights the importance of dressing modestly and understanding Japanese body language, personal space, and nonverbal communication like bowing to navigate cultural differences while visiting Japan."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Transforming Your Cellphone to Make Cheap International Calls Recently, my parents returned from Italy with a few bottles of Chianti and 750 in AT&T calling charges. Buon giorno! With Skype Mobile, users can make free calls to other Skype phones, or calls to non-Skype phones for a fee. Truphone permits you to make free calls to other Truphone users or to sign on to your Skype account. Racking up exorbitant mobile charges is easy to do if you are not careful about using your cellphone internationally. AT&T charges 99 cents a minute to use your phone in Italy (rates vary by country), and that is if you pay for the carrier’s international calling plan. If you do not, the charge goes up to 1.29 a minute. What my parents did not realize was that they could have nearly eliminated those charges if they had set up their (in this case) iPhone and BlackBerry to take advantage of mobile Internet calling services: That 1.29-a-minute charge would have gone down to a much more reasonable 2.4 cents a minute (or nothing at all if they were on a Wi-Fi network). The Internet has been used to make calls for some time. One of the largest providers of the service, Skype, was founded in 2003 and has more than half a billion user accounts. And while many people gather around the PC to talk to far-flung friends and family, new apps and services can replicate that experience (and that savings) on cellphones. To transform your mobile phone into a device capable of making cheap international calls, you need to consider a few things. Ideally, you have a smartphone that can access Wi-Fi, like an iPhone or a Droid. Wi-Fi ensures the best call quality, since it’s carried over a high-speed Internet connection rather than through third-generation, or 3G, cellular networks. But if you don’t have a Wi-Fi-enabled smartphone, you are not out of luck. There are calling services that use local phone numbers rather than wireless data connections to place calls, making them compatible with a wide range of devices. Applications can dial a local access number as if you were placing a regular call; and your call is routed over the Internet at similarly discounted rates. There are also free calling mobile applications, each with its own layout, feature list and call quality. In my tests of more than six different applications by calling friends in Europe and Africa, these stood out: SKYPE FOR MOBILE Like the program for Mac and PCs, Skype Mobile lets you make free calls and send instant messages to fellow Skype users. You can also call non-Skype landlines and cellphones using Skype Credit, a fee-based service that charges pennies per minute for international calls. Skype offers several mobile versions, including Skype for the iPhone and iPod Touch, Skype Lite for Java and Android phones, and Skype for Windows phones. The application for the iPhone and iPod Touch most closely resembles Skype’s familiar desktop program. Though I could send text-based chat messages to my Skype-using friend in Belgrade over AT&T’s 3G network, I needed to connect the phone to a Wi-Fi network to make a call. (You currently cannot make Skype or other Internet-based calls on the iPhone via AT&T’s 3G network, though that could change soon.) After a simple tap of the call button, I could clearly hear his familiar accent without any noticeable lag or choppiness. Similarly, a call I made to a friend’s cellphone in Senegal using Skype Credit was crystal clear in sound and connected in only 15 seconds. We chatted for 10 minutes, which cost me only 2.40. That same call on AT&T, even if I signed on to its international calling plan (which costs 4 a month), would have cost 8.80. Without the international calling plan, the fee would have climbed to 27.80. For those without iPhones or Windows Mobile devices, Skype provides its Skype Lite application. Skype Lite cannot make calls over Wi-Fi or 3G networks, but instead routes calls through a local cellphone number. It isn’t as complicated as it sounds: when using a MyTouch 3G phone, I selected a Skype contact in London. The application started the phone’s dialer and automatically routed the call to a local number. My British pal came through clear and static-free. One thing to remember is that while calls made with Skype Lite are local and your carrier won’t exact a long-distance fee, you are technically making a call. So those calls will count against the minutes in your calling plan. FRING Picking up where Skype Mobile leaves off, Fring provides an even richer experience on more phones. It supports calling over Wi-Fi and 3G on Android and Nokia devices; iPhone 3G calling is on the way. In addition to free calling to Fring members anywhere in the world, the service connects to Skype, Google Talk and MSN Messenger contacts. After installing the Fring application from the Android Marketplace on Sprint’s HTC Hero, I tapped into my Skype account to call my Belgrade friend over Sprint’s network. Since I didn’t need to be in a Wi-Fi hotspot, I made the call while walking down a noisy New York street. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Transforming your cellphone can help you make cheap international calls by using mobile internet calling services and apps like Skype Mobile and Truphone.

Write an article with the title: \\"Billy Eichner calls out Melania Trump at women's event\\" Article:","output":"Title: Billy Eichner calls out Melania Trump at women's event In a recent women's empowerment event, the ever-vocal comedian Billy Eichner made headlines as he openly criticized former First Lady Melania Trump. The star of \\"Billy on the Street\\" and \\"Parks and Recreation\\" used his wit and comedic talent not only to make the audience laugh but also to draw attention to certain aspects of the former First Lady's actions and decisions that he believes are questionable. Eichner began his monologue by addressing the importance of women in today's society, emphasizing the need for equal rights and celebrating the countless achievements and contributions of women in various fields. As the audience cheered in agreement, Eichner swiftly shifted the focus to Melania Trump, highlighting that even in the White House, women's rights have been anything but respected in recent years. Known for his unapologetic, direct humor, Eichner expressed his disappointment in Melania’s “Be Best” campaign, launched during her tenure as First Lady. He argued that while the campaign aimed to promote emotional wellbeing and combat cyberbullying, it fell short of having any significant impact. Eichner pointedly asked the audience, \\"How can a campaign that focuses on cyberbullying be effective when the former President was continuously tweeting insults and derogatory comments throughout his term?\\" He went on to mention her controversial fashion choices during key moments of her time as First Lady, such as the \\"I Really Don't Care, Do U?\\" jacket worn during a trip to visit children separated from their families at the border. Billy Eichner pointed out the message's insensitivity and the devastating effect it had at the time. He also made a sarcastic remark about her recent NFT (Non-Fungible Token) announcement, stating, \\"How inspiring it is to see Melania continue to support meaningful causes post-presidency, like selling digital art and ignoring global issues.\\" Eichner then shifted his focus to Ivanka Trump who, despite holding a position in her father's administration, failed to make significant progress on women's issues. He mentioned that instead of promoting gender equality, she often furthered her father's agenda, which many argue worked against women's rights. Throughout his speech, Billy Eichner called for public figures like Melania Trump to take active and genuine steps to empower women and advocate for change. He said, \\"The fight for women's rights and the eradication of misogyny needs more than just a well-designed campaign or empty promises. It needs genuine action from those in power – individuals who are genuinely committed to making a difference.\\" The event aimed to raise awareness about women's rights and advocate for gender equality and featured several high-profile speakers, including actresses, politicians, and activists. These speakers discussed various topics, from gender pay gaps and workplace discrimination to domestic violence and maintaining a work-life balance. Ultimately, while Billy Eichner's criticism of Melania Trump provided a moment of humor and levity, it also served as a potent reminder of the responsibilities those in the public eye have when it comes to advocating for positive change, particularly in the area of women's rights. His words challenge not only Melania Trump but every influential individual to take a stand for equality and use their platform to create meaningful change in society."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both sentences are providing information about Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony signing contracts with different basketball teams; however, the way this information is presented is slightly different in each sentence. In the first sentence: \\"Chris Chris Paul signed with Oklahoma City Thunder, and Carmelo Anthony signed the Houston Rockets.\\" - Chris Paul is mentioned twice, possibly as a typo. - The preposition \\"with\\" is used for Chris Paul's signing with Oklahoma City Thunder. - The definite article \\"the\\" is omitted before \\"Houston Rockets,\\" which is not a standard construction. In the second sentence: \\"Chris Paul signed to the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Carmelo Anthony signed with the Houston Rockets.\\" - The sentence does not have the mentioned typo and avoids repetition of Chris Paul's name. - The preposition \\"to\\" is used for Chris Paul's signing with Oklahoma City Thunder, which is less common than using \\"with\\" for the same context. - The definite article \\"the\\" is included before \\"Houston Rockets,\\" making it a more standard construction.

First, let's move all the 'u' terms to one side and the number terms to the other side. To do that, we'll add 22*u to both sides:    -22*u + 22*u + 540 = 8*u + 22*u 2. Now, the equation becomes:    540 = 30*u 3. Next, let's find the value of 'u' by dividing both sides by 30:    540 ÷ 30 = 30*u ÷ 30 4.

Background: What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.  Paragraph: Except for their color, there are two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom that the children can use during free time. Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which chair has a lower air pressure? The answer to this question is:","output":"The red chair that Patrick is sitting on would have a lower air pressure. According to Boyle's law, the pressure of a gas increases when its volume decreases. Hence, since Mark weighs more than Patrick, he would reduce the volume of the green chair more than Patrick would reduce the volume of the red chair when they sit. As a result, the air pressure inside the green chair would be higher and the red chair would have lower air pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: Andy Pettitte's dad details purchase of HGH from Kelly Blair, who drops suit against 'Icon' authors By Teri Thompson, Michael O'Keeffe, Christian Red and Nathaniel Vinton DAILY NEWS SPORTS WRITERS Originally Published:Tuesday, September 21st 2010, 11:13 PM Updated: Tuesday, September 21st 2010, 11:13 PM The Texas manÂ who brought a 25 million defamation lawsuit against the authors and publisher of \\"American Icon: The Fall of Roger Clemens and the Rise of Steroids in America's Pastime\\" has dropped the suit after being confronted with a bombshell affidavit detailing his sale of human growth hormone to Andy Pettitte's father. According to the affidavit provided by Tom Pettitte, Texas gym owner Kelly Blair sold HGH to the Yankee pitcher's father three times and personally instructed the elder Pettitte on how to inject the drug, a Schedule III controlled substance approved for limited use that is now banned as a performance-enhancing drug by Major League Baseball. Blair, who is related by marriage to the Pettitte family, was confronted with the document last Thursday during a sworn deposition related to his complaint in Texas state court. The book included an episode in which Tom Pettitte bought HGH from Blair and shared it with his son, then a member of the Houston Astros. The affidavit confirms that episode, which took place at Blair's now-defunct gym, 1-on-1 Elite Personal Fitness, not far from the Pettitte family's home in Deer Park, Tex. After Blair struggled to answer questions about the affidavit in a deposition on Thursday, the proceeding was suspended and Blair withdrew the lawsuit on Friday. The Tom Pettitte affidavit, one of several generated by the lawsuit, says Blair brokered the first of three HGH deals. Tom Pettitte claims he paid 800 for 10 vials, half of which Blair kept for himself, and that Blair personally instructed the elder Pettitte on how to inject the drug. \\"One time he met me in the gym parking lot and retrieved the box with the HGH from his car and gave it to me,\\" Tom Pettitte wrote. \\"Another time, I was present in the gym office when Kelly ordered the HGH over the telephone.\\" Before reading the affidavit provided to Blair's attorneys several days earlier, Blair testified in attorney Jason Gibson's Houston offices that he had never sold performance-enhancing drugs - and that Tom Pettitte would never tell a lie. \\"I'm in shock at what I'm reading here,\\" Blair said upon reading the document, along with other statements of witnesses who testified that they saw Blair with what they thought to be bags of performance-enhancing drugs. \\"I went out on a limb to help Tommy Pettitte, I was concerned about his health, and I can't say I wouldn't do it again,\\" Blair told the Daily News Tuesday night. The Clemens book was written by the sports investigative team at The News and published in 2009 by Alfred A. Knopf. It describes how bad luck and poor choices got Clemens snared in the federal government's crackdown on baseball's drug culture. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

Plot: Act 1: Isabella \\"The Crimson Veil\\" Warner is an underground assassin renowned for her ruthless precision and moral compass. She only accepts contracts to eliminate criminals - never an innocent person. Hailed as a dark legend, her identity is her best-kept secret. She is approached by an anonymous figure who reveals extensive evidence of Cort Abraham, a highly influential and seemingly righteous politician, being involved in heinous crimes, including human trafficking and murder. Isabella investigates the information provided by the anonymous figure and discovers a web of lies, deceit, and political manipulation. Left with no choice but to uphold her ideal, she decides to take on the contract and eliminate the corrupted Cort Abraham. Act 2: As The Crimson Veil dives deeper into Cort's life, it becomes apparent that his reach and influence are far more significant than she initially believed. The trail of his crimes leads her to discover that the abduction of several young girls – one of whom is Isabella's long-lost sister, Olivia. Realizing the personal connection and burden of responsibility, Isabella makes it her life's mission to bring Cort down, no matter the price. The mysterious anonymous figure who sent her the initial information begins to appear more frequently, assisting her in her investigations while remaining elusive about their identity.

Question: Napoleon's planned unification of Europe was referred to as? Context: Hoping to extend the Continental System, Napoleon invaded Iberia and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The Peninsular War lasted six years, noted for its brutal guerrilla warfare, and culminated in an Allied victory. Fighting also erupted in Central Europe, as the Austrians launched another attack against the French in 1809. Napoleon defeated them at the Battle of Wagram, dissolving the Fifth Coalition formed against France. By 1811, Napoleon ruled over 70 million people across an empire that had domination in Europe, which had not witnessed this level of political consolidation since the days of the Roman Empire. He maintained his strategic status through a series of alliances and family appointments. He created a new aristocracy in France while allowing the return of nobles who had been forced into exile by the Revolution. The answer is:","output":"Continental System"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

However, they do seem closely related in meaning. To further elaborate on the relationship between these sentences, let's analyze them in detail. Sentence 1: \\"And you can see the rocket tubes.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is stating that the rocket tubes are clearly visible. There is a sense of certainty that the rocket tubes can be seen. Sentence 2: \\"And you can just glimpse the rocket tubes peaking out.\\" In contrast, this sentence indicates that the rocket tubes are only partially visible, giving a less clear view of them. The word \\"glimpse\\" implies that the sighting might be brief or not as clear as a full view. The connection between the two sentences is the visibility of the rocket tubes. However, while the first sentence asserts that the rocket tubes are clearly visible, the second sentence implies that they are only partially visible and might be more difficult to see. So, given the slight difference in the degree of visibility expressed in both sentences, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. They convey related but not identical information about the visibility of the rocket tubes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Innovative: Tangerine, written and directed by Sean Baker, follows a transgender prostitute on Christmas Eve who has been released from prison and found out her lover - a pimp - has been cheating on her. Simple: The entire project was filmed on the handheld device in a Los Angeles suburb with some scenes being filmed on Baker's ten-speed pedal bike. They were also forced to work in open stores, meaning they would have to cut when a customer walked in. But they admitted one advantage was hardly anyone knew they were filming as the device was so small. Many amateur films are produced on iPhones every day, but this is said to be the first shown at a high profile event. Baker told The Verge: 'It was surprisingly easy. We never lost any footage.' The small crew - working on a shoestring budget - used a number of add-ons to enhance the quality of the picture.

While in the past, your parents or close loved ones might have given you financial backing, you'll have to fend for yourselves, for the most part. However, there can be exceptions made if you're having your vow renewals close to your original wedding date and never got to have a party. Most people believe you shouldn't have a gift registry when you renew your vows. The first time around, your guests could have helped you get a new set of dishware, pay for your honeymoon, or just to have some money to start your new lives together. This time, it can be considered tacky to ask your guests for gifts when you're already an established married couple. But again, if your renewal date is close to your wedding date, then you can consider having a registry if you really need one. The same goes for a bridal shower -- since you're already married, this is generally not thought to be appropriate. Many men and women who have a vow renewal close to their wedding date who never got to have a bachelorette party want to have one. However, many people don't consider this a good idea because these parties are supposed to be your \\"last night out as a single person.\\" Since you're already married, you may have missed the boat for this one. You can still celebrate with a group of your friends, but hold off on the more risque aspects of a traditional bachelor/bachelorette celebration. On a similar note, skip the garter toss and the bouquet toss at your reception since these traditions are heavily associated with the idea of recently ending your time as single people. Instead, consider leading the guests in a variety of fun dances to remove some of the formality.","output":"When you want to celebrate your love again, you can have a special party called a vow renewal.

Question 2: What would happen if the Russian government assassinated the US president or other high ranking US official? What would be the response of the US? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: If a Russian agent assassinated or tried to assassinate the US President, the US response would involve several stages and aspects: 1. Investigation and Confirmation: The first stage would be an immediate and thorough investigation into the assassination attempt, with collaboration from the FBI, CIA, and other intelligence agencies. This would be done to confirm the involvement of a Russian agent and gather evidence. 2. Escalation Measures: If there is credible evidence linking a Russian agent to the assassination attempt, the US would likely respond with a range of escalation measures, including expulsion of Russian diplomats, economic sanctions, and curtailment of diplomatic relations. 3. Military Readiness: The US military would be put on a higher state of alert and readiness for potential retaliation or pre-emptive strikes against Russian targets, although it would not be an immediate response to the assassination attempt. 4. Cyber Countermeasures: The US might also employ cyber countermeasures against Russia, either directly by targeting Russian infrastructure or indirectly by collaborating with allies and international partners. 5. Diplomatic Pressure: The US would enlist the support of its allies, particularly NATO members, to apply diplomatic pressure on Russia to condemn the assassination attempt and demand accountability. Question 2: If the Russian government assassinated the US president or other high-ranking US official, the US response would be more extensive: 1. Investigation and Confirmation: Similar to the first question, a thorough investigation would take place to determine the involvement of the Russian government. 2. Public Condemnation and Crisis Management: The US would publicly condemn the assassination, mobilize with allies, and declare it a hostile act. An internal crisis management system, including succession of power, would also be enforced. 3. Escalation Measures: The US would likely respond with even more severe economic sanctions, expulsion of diplomats, freezing of Russian assets in the US, and possibly closing the US embassy in Russia or severing diplomatic ties altogether. 4. Military Response: The US military would be more prepared for a direct military response against the Russian government with the potential implementation of a limited counterattack or a larger military campaign alongside NATO and other allies. 5. International Coalition: The US would work to build a broad international coalition to condemn the assassination and pressure Russia for accountability. This could lead to a more significant global diplomatic and economic fallout for Russia. Given the two scenarios, the answers would not be exactly the same, as the severity and scope of the US response would vary depending on whether the assassination was carried out by an individual Russian agent or orchestrated by the Russian government. The involvement of the Russian government would lead to a more severe and expansive response, with potential military action and stronger diplomatic and economic consequences."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst.

Apple far decided to start an agroforestry system and other methods to protect their depleted soils, while Pear farm did nothing and had big losses the following years.  But I can use this background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry.

If you want to learn something about the Spanish Civil War and about all the political details and intrigues, let me tell you, you've chosen the wrong film. This is a vision of the war as it happened in Majorca, a small island off the coast of Spain. When a war like this happens in a small island that takes position for the traitor almost at once, there is no war in the open. The soldiers are sent to the front to fight, in the mainland, while another kind of war happens at home, on the small island. There, neighbours tell on other neighbours, sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime, but many people are told on because of old family fights, or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends is told on by someone who wants to \\"earn some points\\". And these things don't happen in the open. There were some trials, true, but many other times people would just be woken up in the middle of the night, taken out of their homes to the closest cemetery where they would be killed. And the next morning the bodies would be found, and people would have an idea of what had happened, but nobody would dare to speak or to do anything. We're not talking about soldiers killing someone they had never seen in their life. We're talking about people killing their neighbours, and probably saying hello to their widow the next day, and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed. We're talking about villages with one or two thousand inhabitants, where everybody knew everybody. I am from that small island and I've heard the stories my grandparents told me, and I must say that this film upset me, oh yes, it did; but I also found it remarkably beautiful and moving. The initial violence is not something the director or the writer made up, that's how things happened during that war. A kid knowing that his mate's dad is in the fascist squad that killed his dad? Completely possible. All that happened later on? Possible too. TB was real too. At that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become. People were poor, illiterate, and worked in small farms. After the war there were times of hardship. So, you won't find a war story in this film, or at least not the kind of war story you expect. There are no battlefields, no soldiers, no political intrigues. This is the meanest kind of war, which happens when the space is limited (just check the size of the island), when neighbours fight with their neighbours, when members of the same family fight each other, and they live in a place where everybody knows everybody. You'll find a story about the damage that this particular kind of war can cause to people and the story of how they survive that damage, or maybe they don't. I must mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors, who managed to sound really Majorcan. That was remarkable. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is a mix of being upset and moved by the film, but also finding it remarkably beautiful and appreciative of its depiction of the war in Majorca.

However, when Mr. Hammond dies, Anne is sent to an orphanage where she eventually receives the wonderful news that she has been adopted by a couple on Prince Edward Island. Upon arriving in P.E.I, Anne is met at the train station by an elderly Matthew Cuthbert who is surprised to find a girl there instead of a boy. Matthew and his sister Marilla had requested a boy to help them with the farm chores. He decides that he couldn't very well just leave the girl at the train station. Matthew takes Anne to meet Marilla, and on the buggy ride home, becomes completely smitten with the red-haired orphan girl. When Anne Shirley arrives at the Cuthberts' farm, called \\"Green Gables\\", she is a precocious, romantic child desperate to be loved and highly sensitive about her red hair and homely looks. In her own unique headstrong manner, Anne manages to insult the town gossip, Rachel Lynde, in a dispute over her looks; smash her slate over Gilbert Blythe's head when he calls her \\"Carrots\\" on her first day of school; and accidentally dyes her hair green in an effort to turn her red hair black and salvage her wounded pride. Marilla Cuthbert is shocked and beside herself to know how she will ever cope with this sensitive, headstrong child so desperate to fit in. But shy, gentle Matthew is always there to defend Anne and hold her up on a pedestal. It seems like Anne is destined to cultivate disaster. She becomes \\"bosom\\" friends with Diana Barry from across the pond and succeeds in getting Diana drunk by accidentally serving currant wine instead of raspberry cordial at a tea party. Diana's mother and Rachel Lynde turn on Marilla for making wine in the first place.

The primary emphasis is on the action of varying the assay and the subsequent consequences. In the second sentence, the emphasis is more on the condition or situation that the selected assay undergoes variation, and the resulting change in selective pressure and the properties of the transformed cells. The sentence demonstrates this concept as something happening or occurring due to the variation in the selected assay.

Write an article based on this \\"What is more important: farming, or finance?\\"","output":"Title: The Comparative Importance of Farming and Finance Step 1: Introduction In an era that seamlessly integrates both manual labor and digital technology, the importance of farming and finance in our society cannot be undermined. Both sectors play crucial roles in shaping our daily lives, the economy, and the future. However, deciphering which one is more important between farming, the age-old practice that feeds the globe, and finance, the engine driving the world economy, presents an intriguing discourse. Step 2: Understanding the Role of Each Sector Farming, or agriculture, is the backbone of our existence. It provides the food we eat, directly impacting our survival. It's an industry that, despite technological advances, cannot be fully automated or digitalized. This is because our food largely relies on the unpredictable aspects of nature - weather, soil conditions, biological factors, among others. On the other hand, finance holds the mantle in dictating the wealth and economic health of nations. It represents the economic structures, banking systems, stock exchanges, and trade agreements that keep global economies afloat. By managing, investing, and allocating resources, finance serves as the buffer between economic ups and downs. Step 3: Weighing the Importance of Both Sectors From a purely survivalist perspective, it could be argued that farming edges out. It caters to our basic human need - food. Without sustenance, no amount of financial wealth holds significant value. Moreover, farming also contributes to the economy, providing jobs, contributing goods for exports, and sustaining rural communities. However, without finance, the structure on which modern society is built could crumble. This sector directly impacts government policies, currency stability, wealth distribution, and business decisions. The financial sector fuels growth and innovation, impacting almost every other sector, including farming. Step 4: Interdependence Between Farming and Finance The dynamic relationship between farming and finance is vital to consider. The success of the farming industry is, to a large extent, dependent on financial support, be it in the form of loans, subsidies, or technological investments. Conversely, a significant part of the world's finances is tied to agriculture through food exports, farm equipment production, and agribusiness.  Step 5: Conclusion To definitively say whether farming or finance is more important would be a reductionist view of their intertwined relationship. Both are the wheels that keep society moving forward - feeding us, connecting us, and driving economic development. Rather than debating their importance, it would be more productive to focus on how these sectors can work harmoniously, supporting each other for the benefit of all. Justification of Steps: 1. The introduction laid out the context of the discourse and presented the two sectors in question to provide an effective opener. 2. I broke down the roles of each sector independently to provide a clearer understanding of their functions. 3. I examined the significance of both sectors from two viewpoints – survival and economic stability – to explore their comparative importance. 4. I elucidated on the interdependence between the two sectors to highlight their interconnectedness fundamentally. 5. Lastly, I arrived at a balanced conclusion that emphasized the unity between farming and finance, thus rounding off the article."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart, was born in Kingfish, Oklahoma on March 29, 1918. He was raised in Missouri where he worked in his father's store while attending school. This was his first retailing   experience and he really enjoyed it. After graduation, he began his own career as a retail merchant. He soon opened his first Wal-Mart store in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas. Wal-Mart specialized in name brands at low prices and Sam Walton was surprised at the success. Soon a chain of Wal-Mart stores sprang up across rural America. Walton's management style was popular with employees and he founded some of the basic concepts of management that are still in use today. After taking the company public in 1970, Walton introduced his \\"profit sharing plan\\". The profit sharing plan was a plan for Wal-Mart employees to improve their income dependent on the profits of the store. Sam Walton believed that \\"individuals don't win, teams do\\". Employees at Wal-Mart stores were offered stock options   and store discounts. These benefits are commonplace today, but Walton was among the first to implement   them. Walton believed that a happy employee meant happy customers and more sales. He also believed that by giving employees a part of the company and making their success dependent on the company's success, they would care about the company. By the 1980s, Wal-Mart had sales of over one billion dollars and over three hundred stores across North America. Wal-Mart's unique decentralized   distribution system, also Walton's idea, created the _ needed to further encourage growth in the 1980s during growing complaints that the \\"superstore\\" was stopping smaller and traditional stores from developing. By 1991, Wal-Mart was the largest US retailer with 1,700 stores. Walton remained active in managing the company, as president and CEO until 1988 and chairman until his death. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom shortly before his death.

Bacliff, Texas (CNN) -- Sitting on their front porch in this Houston suburb, Edmond Demiraj and his family seem the picture of a contented family.  But the Department of Justice now wants to upend the family: threatening to deport his wife and 19-year-old son back to their native Albania, even though he says federal prosecutors a decade ago promised him help and a Green Card in exchange for Edmond's promised testimony in a human smuggling case against a fellow Albanian immigrant. For the Demiraj family, they believe it will mean great harm, even death, for those deported.  A decade ago, Edmond Demiraj (pronounced: dem-EAR-eye) was himself an illegal immigrant. He told CNN he had walked across the U.S. border from Mexico to Brownsville, Texas without any paperwork. He found work as a painter, he says, with a fellow Albanian named Bill Bedini.  Not long afterwards, the Justice Department indicted Bedini, accusing him and others of running a human smuggling ring, bringing illegal aliens from Mexico into the United States. Demiraj was named in the original indictment but charges against him were later dropped.  Attorneys for the Justice Department based in Houston wanted Demiraj to testify against Bedini. In exchange, Demiraj told CNN that prosecutors promised him and his family protection and promised him a Green Card, which would lead to citizenship. The offer, he says, was verbal and not on paper.  \\"I'm ready to work for the U.S. government, whatever they need from me,\\" Demiraj told CNN.  But Bedini entered a plea of not guilty, was granted bail and soon fled to Albania, according to the U.S. Marshal's office in Houston. Federal prosecutors didn't need Demiraj's testimony and handed him over to immigration officials, who quickly deported him as well.  Answer this series of questions: 1. Where were they sitting? 2.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence  . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire   to find a way out of trouble. Question: What did the company where Dick Drew work learn from its mistake? - They encouraged people to work a longer time. - They discouraged   people to think freely. - They asked people to spend all their work time developing new ideas. - They encouraged people to spend some of their work time thinking and improving new ideas.

The perfect woman: A poll of 2,000 women revealed many would love the eyes of Nicole Scherzinger, the nose of Samantha Cameron and the hair of Katherine Jenkins. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder - or in the toned abs of Jessica Ennis, Beyonce's legs and Samantha Cameron's nose, according to a poll on the perfect celebrity body. Researchers also found the average British woman would love to have wavy hair like Katherine Jenkins, Kelly Brook's waistline and eyes like Nicole Scherzinger. The answers given by 2,000 women on their changing attitudes to body image also revealed one in five have 'given up' trying to improve their body shape. Commissioned by Morrisons to launch its NuMe range of healthier food, the survey also found people are working harder on their own bodies, with 46 per cent stating they would always strive to keep improving their health and fitness. Meanwhile, 61 per cent said starting a healthy eating regime would give an instant boost to their confidence and a quarter said avoiding chocolate would help them feel better about their figures. One in three go to the gym as their quick fix to feeling healthier, while 13 per cent said a shopping trip would have the same effect. When asked if diets worked in the long run, 48 per cent felt they didn't. Bryonie Holleart, nutritionist for Morrirons NuMe, said the findings revealed a window into the 'quick-fix' nature of people's eating habits.

Squats and lunges are common in various sports and workouts, such as weightlifting, cross-training, HIIT (high-intensity interval training), functional fitness, and even yoga or pilates. Additionally, the mention of their legs turning to jelly is indicative of a very intense, muscle-focused workout. The narrative does not provide enough information to pinpoint the exact sport or discipline the narrator is participating in. However, their workout routine primarily focuses on lower body strength exercises like squats and lunges, which can be found across several sports and fitness programs.

Indigenous peoples of the Americas Large numbers of Bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language, culture, customs, and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period. They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of \\"empowered caciques\\" to further communal organization. Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953. While the National Revolutionary Movement government begun in 1952 discouraged self-identification as indigenous (reclassifying rural people as campesinos, or peasants), renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the Katarista movement beginning in the 1970s. Lowland indigenous peoples, mostly in the east, entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the CIDOB confederation. That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ILO Convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and titling indigenous territories.

Later, private eye Donald Strachey arrives at a hospital to meet with a client. While there, he sees his partner, Tim Callahan, who is escorting his boss, a prominent New York State senator who is there for a photo op with the comatose Catholic Bishop McFee. Santin reveals that the client is Rutka, who Strachey despises for his activities outing prominent local closeted homophobes. Strachey initially declines the assignment, but later accepts after Rutka is attacked and offers a large retainer. Rutka shows Strachey his files on outing targets, one of which is Bruno Slinger, a prominent state politician who has voted against gay rights. When a fire breaks out at Rutka's house, Strachey puts it out. As he investigates, Strachey becomes convinced Rutka and Santin are staging the various attacks, quits the case, and returns the unused portion of the retainer. The next morning, a news program reports Rutka's death. When Santin indignantly calls him, Strachey apologizes, returns with Santin to retrieve Rutka's files for safekeeping, and retakes the case. Santin identifies three upcoming targets: Slinger, children's show host Ronnie Linklater, and an unidentified man. Strachey finds a torn-off mudflap and initials for three persons Rutkin paid off. Strachey tracks the first two to local hotel owners who spied on their guests for Rutka. They reveal that Slinger was sexually connected to Linklater and that Linklater had weekly sex with another man who possibly accidentally died. Strachey traces a license plate to Art Murphy, a used car dealer, who refuses to cooperate. The man who visited Rutka's hospital room attacks Callahan at their home. Strachey arrives in time to drive him away, but Callahan is hospitalized. The experience shakes Strachey enough to consider abandoning the case until Callahan, who has had a change of heart about Rutka, convinces him to continue.

The premise provides adequate information to support the hypothesis and does not contradict it. The phrase \\"now a black shadow on his jaw\\" suggests that the bruise has either darkened or changed its appearance, moving from its earlier state to one that can be described as a \\"black shadow.\\" This detail aligns with the nature of bruises and the healing process, where initially a bruise may appear as a reddish or purple color and transition into a darker shade as the healing continues. Following this process, comparing the appearance of a bruise to a \\"black shadow\\" would be a fairly accurate description. Furthermore, since the jaw is a facial feature and often a visible area, it is clear that the \\"black shadow\\" mentioned would refer to the appearance of the bruise. This strengthens the validity of the hypothesis that the bruise on Anse's jaw appears as a black shadow. Conversely, if the premise had provided information contradicting the idea of the bruise appearing as a black shadow, we would not be able to support the hypothesis. However, with the description provided in the premise, it is safe to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The bruise on his jaw appeared as a black shadow\\" is, in fact, true based on the available information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article with the title: \\"Aston Martin CEO: We won't build an SUV because 'boxes aren’t beautiful'\\" Article:","output":"Title: Aston Martin CEO: We won't build an SUV because 'boxes aren’t beautiful' Introduction: Ever since the boom in the popularity of SUVs, many luxury car makers have joined the bandwagon in producing their own versions of these robust and spacious vehicles. However, Aston Martin CEO, Tobias Moers, recently announced that the iconic British luxury sports car manufacturer will not be developing an SUV, stating that \\"boxes aren’t beautiful\\". The decision comes as a surprise to many, especially in an era where most car manufacturers are embracing the trend. Step 1: Reasons behind Aston Martin not creating an SUV Aston Martin is known for its sleek, stunning designs and powerful performance in the world of sports cars. Tobias Moers maintains that the company will remain true to its tradition of building elegant and high-performance vehicles. By not succumbing to the pressures of creating an SUV, Aston Martin is staying faithful to its artistic vision, refusing to compromise on aesthetics for the sake of market trends. Step 2: Examining the market trend While many luxury car makers, such as Lamborghini, Bentley, and Rolls-Royce, have branched out into the SUV market, Moers insists that Aston Martin recognized that luxury is not always about size and space but is often defined by the visual appeal and driving experience. By not producing an SUV, Aston Martin is aiming to avoid diluting its brand identity and maintain its position as a purveyor of unique, stunning automobiles. Step 3: The potential drawbacks of this decision Aston Martin's decision not to produce an SUV may have financial implications. The demand for SUVs has been steadily increasing in recent years, proving to be a lucrative market for many automakers. However, by deciding to forgo the SUV market, Aston Martin risks potentially missing out on a considerable share of profit. Step 4: Countering drawbacks with alternative offerings To address concerns over potential loss of profit, Aston Martin has hinted at other projects in the pipeline. While details remain scarce, fans of the brand can expect exciting developments in the near future, potentially within the realm of electric vehicles, as the world gradually shifts toward sustainability. Conclusion: Aston Martin's decision to not build an SUV is a bold and unique stance in today's competitive automobile market. By prioritizing aesthetics and adhering to its core principles, Aston Martin remains devoted to producing vehicles that define luxury not just by size and space, but by artful design and power. While the decision may mean passing up some profits, it showcases the company's commitment to staying true to its artistic vision and further enhances its exclusiveness in the world of luxury sports cars."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have 0 = -4*r - 2*r - 6. Imagine you have -4 apples, then you add -2 more apples, and then you have to figure out how many apples you need to get rid of to have 0 apples in total. This is what we are doing, but with r (like apples). First, let's combine the r's: -4*r + (-2*r) = -6*r Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -6*r - 6 Now let's address the -6. We want to get r by itself, so we need to get rid of the -6 from the equation. To do that, we will do the opposite of subtraction, which is addition. We will add 6 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 6 = -6*r - 6 + 6 This simplifies to: 6 = -6*r Now, we want to get r by itself. Right now, we have -6 multiplied by r. We need to do the opposite of multiplication, which is division. We will divide both sides by -6. 6 / -6 = (-6*r) / -6 This simplifies to: -1 = r So, r equals to -1. And that's the answer!

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too.

This book benefit was seen across countries, and held regardless of the parent's educational back-ground, father's occupation or the political system of the country, the researchers say. The results, based on data from 73,249 people living in 27 countries, including the United States, show that having a 500-book library boosted a child's education by 3.2 years on average. \\"You get a great effect for your books,\\" said study researcher Mariah Evans, a sociologist at the University of Nevada, Reno. \\"It's quite a good return-on-investment in a time of scarce resources.\\" For years, educators have thought the strongest predictor of attaining high levels of education was having parents who were highly educated. But according to the findings, a good-sized book library is just as good as university-educated parents in terms of increasing education level. \\"Even a little bit goes a long way,\\" in terms of the number of books in a home, Evans said. Having as few as 20 books in the home still has a significant impact on propelling a child to a higher level of education, and the more books are added, the greater the benefit. In some countries, such as China, having 500 or more books in the home propels children 6. 6 years further in their education. In the United States, the effect is less, 2.4 years. But, Evans points out that 2.4 years is still a significant advantage in terms of educational achievement. For example, Americans who have some college or an associate's degree, but not a bachelor's degree, earn an average of  7,213 more annually than those with just a high school education. Those who attain a bachelor's degree earn  21,185 more each year, on average, than those with just high school diplomas. Having books in the home is twice as important as the father's education level, and more important than whether a child was educated in China or the United States. Question: What was the author's purpose of writing the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"To show the importance of books in the home.\\"?

That's a dramatic increase from the 105 publishers of the past that produced only 10,000 different books.        Rapid economic development and universal education since China adopted the reform has helped fuel the need for more information sources.        Under the market economy, hundreds of publishing houses and newspapers have taken steps to restructure management systems into corporations listed on the stock market.        The legal system overseeing the news and publishing industries in China has also changed over the last three decades.

A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  and the situation: Ben and Jerry were two friends with very different dietary habits.

But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too.

To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit.

LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters)  -- Massive dogs belonging to \\"Mission: Impossible\\" star Ving Rhames attacked and killed a live-in caretaker at the actor's Los Angeles home Friday, police said. A sign on the gate of actor Ving Rhames' home points out that a dog is on the premises. The caretaker, whose name was not released by authorities, was found dead on the front lawn of Rhames' gated home in an expensive Brentwood neighborhood, covered in dog bites, a Los Angeles police spokesman said. Several large dogs were running loose on the property when police responded to the scene shortly after 7:15 a.m. (10:15 a.m. ET) and animal control officers took three huge bull mastiffs and an English bulldog into custody. \\"It appeared that the person suffered a number of injuries as a result of the dog mauling,\\" Sgt. Lee Sands said. \\"There were numerous dog bites all over his body, but the exact cause of death is pending the coroner's ruling.\\" Sands said four dogs, the largest weighing nearly 200 pounds, were being quarantined as part of an investigation into the attack. He said it was not yet clear how many of the dogs had taken part in the mauling or why they had turned on the caretaker. The victim, who worked for Rhames for two years and lived on the property, was pronounced dead at the scene. Television pictures showed the body being removed from the scene, covered in a blanket. Neighbors said that they had never seen signs of aggression from the dogs. Representatives for Rhames, who is out of the country shooting a film, had no immediate comment. The 46-year-old actor is known for starring in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and alongside Tom Cruise in all three \\"Mission: Impossible\\" movies. Rhames has a long list of film and television credits.

Write the next sentence in this paragraph: How to choose the perfect first holy communion dress  Start shopping as early as possible.  Communion season is in the spring, so mid-winter (december and january) are the best times to start shopping. You'll have the most selection and won't be scrambling to find the right dress at the last minute.","output":"When selecting the ideal first holy communion dress, it is crucial to consider several factors such as style, comfort, the parish's dress code, and your child's personal preferences. First and foremost, familiarize yourself with your church's guidelines regarding dress codes and specific requirements to avoid buying a dress that doesn't conform to their standards. You might find that certain churches have strict rules on sleeve lengths, dress lengths, or even color. Next, determine the style that best suits your child's personality and body type. Traditional communion dresses are typically characterized by their modest, timeless designs, featuring elements like lace, satin, and embroidery. Modern options, on the other hand, have a more contemporary flair, incorporating unique patterns, innovative materials, and fashionable detailing. Moreover, opt for a dress that highlights your child's best features and makes her feel comfortable and confident. The importance of comfort cannot be overemphasized, as the first holy communion is a significant event steeped in spiritual solemnity. Your child will be more focused on the ceremony if she is not distracted by discomfort from the dress. Therefore, choose natural, breathable fabrics that are gentle on the skin, and make sure the dress fits well without being too tight or too loose. Accessorizing the dress is another important aspect of the ensemble. Accompany the dress with a matching veil, a delicate tiara or a headband, and white dress shoes that are both comfortable and stylish. Don't forget to add the right hosiery, with classic white tights or socks being the most popular choice. Lastly, finish the look with minimal, age-appropriate jewelry, such as a small cross pendant necklace or a delicate bracelet. Remember to involve your child in the decision-making process, allowing her to express her preferences and style while staying within the boundaries of the church's guidelines. This way, you can foster a sense of excitement and anticipation surrounding her special day and create beautiful memories together. In summary, when choosing the perfect first holy communion dress, start shopping early, adhere to your parish's dress code, prioritize style and comfort, and accessorize appropriately with matching items that emphasize your child's personality. By following these steps, you can ensure that your child's first holy communion is a memorable and meaningful milestone in her spiritual journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Solve this instance: A letter from a senior official says the way it estimated changes in the central government grant was wrong. Police and crime commissioners said the process was a \\"shambles\\" and called for it to be abandoned. Policing minister Mike Penning said the funding model was being \\"refined\\" in light of feedback from forces. Forces' final allocations would not be settled until after the government's spending review later this month, he said. Six constabularies and London's deputy mayor for policing and crime had threatened legal action over the process. Devon and Cornwall Police, one of the forces expecting to be badly hit by the proposals, said the changes could affect all 43 forces. Thirty-one of the 43, according to its calculations, will be worse off the than the funding formula proposed last month because of the error, whereas 12 will be better off compared to that proposal - including the Metropolitan Police, whose grant will be cut by only £3 million instead of £184 million. Lancashire's Police and Crime Commissioner, Clive Grunshaw, said: \\"It is incompetence on a monumental scale.  It beggars belief.\\" Conservative Stephen Greenhalgh, London's deputy mayor for policing, said: \\"The main purpose of changing the police funding formula was to make the system more transparent and fairer. \\"However, the current approach is shambolic and fast becoming a lottery - with a police force needing to buy the raw data to prove the Home Office sums did not add up. The Home Office must think again and postpone this review for a year.\\" The Home Office acknowledged errors were made but said it did not recognise the Devon and Cornwall calculations. Police funding was cut by 18% in real terms from 2010-16, and significant further cuts are expected as the government looks to balance the economy. Mr Penning said the old funding formula was \\"not fit for purpose\\". He added: \\"If we want policing in this country to be the best it can be, then we must reform further, and that includes putting police funding on a long-term, sustainable footing. \\"Allocations for individual police force areas have not been set and decisions on funding will not be made until after the Spending Review reports in November.\\" Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey released a letter from the Home Office director general for crime and policing, Mary Calam, to the office of the Devon and Cornwall PCC in which she admitted that some of the data used to calculate the allocations was out of date and had been updated. \\"I would like to again confirm that it is this updated measure that we propose to use in determining final allocations,\\" she said. Cumbria's Police and Crime Commissioner, Richard Rhodes, said his force could face an additional £5.8m a year cut in revenue in addition to the £9m they had been told about. He said the error undermined the credibility of the consultation process. \\"The provision of accurate percentages to allow PCCs and chief constables to assess the potential impact of proposals on individual forces is a critical part of the process,\\" he added. \\"We would therefore urge the Home Office to appoint an independent panel to review the funding formula and consultation process.\\" Student:","output":"The UK Home Office made errors in estimating central government grant changes for police funding, leading to frustration among police forces and calls for the process to be abandoned or revised."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This movie was a tribute to R. D. Burman. Jhankaar Beats is a story about love, friendship, and music. Deep is happily married to the lovely Shanti, with a little daughter Muskaan and another baby on the way. Rishi is his best friend and colleague at an advertising agency. Rishi is a little immature and stubborn, and this keeps on causing fights at home with his equally headstrong wife Nicky. Rishi and Deep are dedicated musicians, obsessive about the music of R.D. Burman. They play at a club sometimes and compete in an annual pop music contest called \\"Jhankaar Beats\\" — they have lost for the past two years. When the movie starts, Rishi has been kicked out of his house by Nicky and the two are considering getting a divorce. Deep's nagging mother-in-law has come for a two-month visit. The men are under pressure to get an advertising campaign ready for a new client, an oddball condom manufacturer. Around this time they meet Indraneel (Shayan Munshi, Neel for short), who is the son of their boss Mr. Kapoor and is joining the company.

Please answer a question about the following article about Planck constant: The Faraday constant F is the charge of one mole of electrons, equal to the Avogadro constant NA multiplied by the elementary charge e. It can be determined by careful electrolysis experiments, measuring the amount of silver dissolved from an electrode in a given time and for a given electric current. In practice, it is measured in conventional electrical units, and so given the symbol F90. Substituting the definitions of NA and e, and converting from conventional electrical units to SI units, gives the relation to the Planck constant. What is the Faraday constant?","output":"The Faraday constant (F) represents the total electric charge carried by one mole of electrons. It is a fundamental constant in electrochemistry and plays a significant role in various chemical processes, such as electrolysis. The Faraday constant is the product of two other fundamental constants: Avogadro's constant (N_A) and the elementary charge (e).  Avogadro's constant (N_A) is the number of particles (atoms, ions, or molecules) in one mole of a substance, approximately equal to 6.022 x 10^23 particles per mole. The elementary charge (e) represents the absolute magnitude of the charge of a single electron, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^(-19) coulombs. To calculate the Faraday constant, multiply Avogadro's constant by the elementary charge: F = N_A × e F ≈ (6.022 x 10^23 mol^(-1)) × (1.602 x 10^(-19) C) F ≈ 96,485 C mol^(-1) Therefore, the Faraday constant is approximately 96,485 coulombs per mole (C mol^(-1)). In practice, it is often denoted as F_90 when referring to measurements performed in conventional electrical units. The Faraday constant is related to the Planck constant (h) through its connection to the elementary charge (e) and Avogadro's constant (N_A). The Planck constant is a fundamental quantity in quantum mechanics and is used to describe the smallest possible quantized energy levels of particles, such as photons and electrons. By substituting the definitions of N_A and e, and converting from conventional electrical units to SI units, the relation between the Faraday constant and the Planck constant can be established, which is important for understanding the link between the macroscopic world of chemistry and the microscopic world of quantum mechanics."},{"instruction":"WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself.

They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  and the situation: Vince had a small rural farm.

These days, it seems, it's not enough for a digital device to just play games. To keep up with the smartphones and tablet computers of the world, any game system needs to at least nod in the direction of cloud-based and social networking \\"apps\\" that are all the rage with the kiddies. Sony's PlayStation Vita has now done exactly that, launching free downloadable Netflix, Twitter and Flickr apps in conjunction with the system's official debut Wednesday (though pre-orderers have had the system for a week now). Your very first encounter with two of these apps foreshadows the occasionally awkward experience to come. When you first load up Twitter or Flickr on your Vita, you're asked to click a button that opens up a web browser where you can log in to the service. Then you're expected to write down a confirmation code and navigate back to the original app to confirm your credentials. It's a minor, one-time annoyance, but it makes the Netflix app's integrated login prompt seem futuristic by comparison. CNN Tech: Hands-on with the new PlayStation Vita. Netflix. Netflix is probably the most useful of the apps in the Vita's initial batch. Even if you already have the streaming video service on a host of other devices (and you probably do), the Vita's large, crisp screen provides a pleasant portable viewing experience without being quite as large or cumbersome as an iPad or laptop (not to mention an HDTV). The Vita's 960 x 544 resolution isn't quite \\"HD,\\" but high-definition content still looks pretty good, provided you have the bandwidth to view it (warning to 3G users: Netflix will eat up your data allowance incredibly quickly). This is the only Vita app so far that makes use of the system's face buttons as well as the touch screen, letting you fast forward and rewind with the analog stick or pause with the X button. You can also use the touch screen to flick through a timeline of screengrabs from the video, which is quite pleasant. My only real complaint about the interface is the odd inability to scroll through the front page of recommendations with quick flicks -- instead you have to awkwardly tap on-screen buttons to move up and down the rows. Twitter. The Vita's Twitter app, dubbed LiveTweet, provides all the basic functionality you'd expect from the service and then some. It's easy to scroll through your timeline, @replies or direct messages with responsive flick scrolling and a familiar pull-down-to-refresh option. You can easily search through tweets by keyword or hashtag and even view a series of @replies through a handy conversation view. Writing tweets is relatively painless using the Vita's big on-screen keyboard, though I found myself often missing the space bar when I was typing quickly. But LiveTweet is somewhat annoying to use if you, like me, primarily use Twitter as a way to scan for interesting links posted by interesting friends. Clicking a link from LiveTweet loads up the Vita's somewhat limited web browser, which takes a few seconds to warm up and then load the page. Once you come back to LiveTweet, the app has often lost your place in browsing the tweetstream, which means you have to wait a few seconds for everything to load again and then waste time scrolling to find your place. It's also hard to imagine where Twitter for the Vita is going to find its niche. If you're on the computer, you likely have a better Twitter app just a click away. If you're away from the computer, you're more likely to have a Twitter-capable smartphone that's handier to carry around than the massive Vita, which easily dominates any pocket it fits in. Still, if you need to tell the world about your Super Stardust Delta high score right now, you're only a few taps away from doing so on the Vita. Flickr. Flickr rounds out the Vita's initial round of apps, with quite possibly the nicest interface of the bunch. Rows of easy-to-scroll-through thumbnail images provide quick access to you photostream, favorites, contacts, saved searches and even suggestions for interesting Flickr members to browse through. There's also a nice batch upload option that doesn't even require leaving the main menu, though why you'd want to upload many photos from the Vita's low-quality camera is a mystery (the service might be more useful for uploading screenshots, though, which I did while composing writing this very piece). It only takes a couple of taps to go from a tiny thumbnail to a beautiful, full-screen image that you can easily pan and zoom around with the multitouch screen. It is somewhat annoying, though, that you can only view caption and tag information when the image is an unzoomed, compact square on the right side of the screen -- some sort of transparent overlay option would have been nice. It's also a bit odd that there's no option to download photos to your Vita to use as home screen wallpapers, though you can use the Vita's screenshot function to approximate this feature. So far, the Vita's nongaming apps feel more like nice extras than crucial selling points for the system. They work better as a proof-of-concept for the potential nongaming uses of the Vita's excellent touchscreen than as tools you're likely to fully integrate into your digital life. Here's hoping Sony relaxes its tight hold on the PlayStation Network marketplace to let more app makers play around with the system's potential outside of games. COPYRIGHT 2011 ARSTECHNICA.COM.

Once dismissed by hard-core conservative critics as \\"the divorced, childless, Protestant woman from former East Germany\\", the German chancellor's landslide victory in Sunday's Bundestag elections has reinforced her position as the uncontested political leader in Germany and the rest of Europe. For a few hours Sunday night, Merkel's center-right CDU/CSU parties seemed even within striking distance of an absolute majority of seats, a feat only West German CDU \\"Uber-Chancellor\\" Konrad Adenauer achieved in 1957. Under the rules of Germany's complex electoral system, the Conservatives received 41.5% of the vote but 49.3% of the seats (five members short of an absolute majority in the 630-strong Bundestag).

Write an email with the following subject: CFTC issues in Norway Email:","output":"Subject: CFTC Issues in Norway Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to you today to address the recent issues surrounding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and its impact on our operations in Norway. It has come to our attention that there are certain concerns about the regulatory changes and compliance implications, which require our immediate understanding and, where necessary, prompt action to ensure the smooth functioning of our business. Firstly, I would like to provide a brief overview of the CFTC's role and relevance to our activities in the financial sector. The CFTC is an independent agency in the United States government responsible for regulating the futures and options markets. Though headquartered in the US, its regulatory framework and mandates have a significant impact on global financial markets. As our business operates within these markets, CFTC regulations and enforcement efforts can profoundly affect our operations. Recently, the CFTC has been working on expanding its international regulatory oversight, with particular focus on cross-border activities. This development has raised certain questions about the potential impact on our Norwegian operations. To facilitate better understanding and to keep everyone informed, I have listed some major areas of concern and the relevant regulatory aspects: 1. Derivatives Regulation and Reporting: The CFTC requires registered entities and market participants to adhere to specific rules regarding the trading and reporting of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. With the expansion of regulatory oversight, we must ensure that our Norwegian activities are in compliance with all relevant reporting rules. It is imperative that we review our current reporting mechanisms, identify any discrepancies, and promptly implement corrective measures as necessary. 2. Cross-Border Exemptions: The CFTC currently grants exemptions to certain non-US entities to conduct activities within the US markets, without the need to register with the CFTC. However, as the regulatory focus on cross-border activities intensifies, these exemptions may be modified or revoked altogether. In such cases, our company might need to register with the CFTC and comply with US regulatory requirements. We should consult with our legal and compliance teams to assess the potential implications and chart out an appropriate course of action. 3. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Rules: The CFTC has been working closely with US and international regulatory bodies to strengthen AML and KYC requirements. This recent push has led to increased scrutiny of non-US entities operating in global financial markets. We must revisit our existing AML and KYC policies to ensure full compliance with any revised standards and potential changes in registration requirements. 4. Enforcement Actions and Penalties: Ensuring regulatory compliance is of the utmost importance, as non-compliance may lead to significant enforcement actions, including substantial penalties and reputational damage. Our company must proactively identify and address any deficiencies in our policies, procedures, and systems and invest in staff training to minimize the risk of violations and regulatory penalties. To effectively address these concerns and safeguard our operations, I would like to request a thorough assessment of our current compliance framework and regulatory preparedness by our legal, compliance, and risk management teams. It is crucial that we analyze our existing systems, promptly identify any potential vulnerabilities, and take appropriate steps to ensure regulatory adherence. In addition, I recommend scheduling a company-wide webinar to educate our employees on the recent CFTC developments and their impact on our operations in Norway. Once we have a comprehensive understanding of the current situation and potential future developments, we can implement an effective strategy to mitigate regulatory risks and ensure the ongoing success of our Norwegian operations. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require any further clarification. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Q: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"From the given sentence, we can extract several pieces of data: 1. Subject: Bandeja paisa is the primary subject of the sentence. It is a specific dish being discussed. 2. Origin: The sentence specifies where Bandeja paisa originates from, which is the Antioquia Department region. This information provides a geographical context for the dish. 3. Cultural significance: The sentence implies that Bandeja paisa may have some cultural significance, as it is associated with a specific region - the Antioquia Department. This could suggest that it is a traditional dish within the local cuisine. 4. Indication of ingredients or cooking method: While the sentence does not provide any specific information about the ingredients, cooking method, or presentation of Bandeja paisa, it indicates that it is a unique dish easily identified within the culinary repertoire of the Antioquia Department. 5. Potential language influence: From the name of the dish, Bandeja paisa, we may infer some language influence—for example, it is likely that Spanish is spoken in the Antioquia Department region, as the dish's name appears to be in Spanish. \\"Bandeja\\" translates to \\"tray\\" in English, which could provide some insight into the dish's presentation, and \\"paisa\\" is a term commonly used to refer to the people from the Antioquia region in Colombia. 6. Connection to local community: As the dish is tied to a specific geographical region, we can infer that Bandeja paisa may create a connection between the local community and their culinary heritage. It could be a dish that is passed down through generations, enjoyed in families or at special events, and represents the tastes and flavors of the Antioquia Department region. 7. Popularity: Although the sentence does not explicitly mention the popularity of Bandeja paisa, the fact that it is specified as a dish originating from the Antioquia Department region may suggest that it is well-known or popular within that area and potentially beyond. In summary, from the sentence, we have learned that Bandeja paisa is a dish with a specific geographical origin (Antioquia Department region), likely has cultural significance to the local community, and potentially possesses unique ingredients, cooking methods, or presentation. We can also infer language influence and a connection between the dish and the local community's culinary heritage. Despite the lack of explicit information on popularity and specific details about the dish, we can assume that Bandeja paisa is an identifiable and important aspect of the Antioquia Department's cuisine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave.

Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Does lake Mahoe have more or less chemicals in it than lake Tresco?  Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Answer:","output":"Lake Mahoe likely has more chemicals in it than Lake Tresco, due to its proximity to the large farm that uses fertilizers and pesticides which can runoff into the lake and contaminate the water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Are weasels pets or pests? Should I have a weasel as a pet? Do those questions have the same meaning? OPTIONS: A). no. B). yes.","output":"Weasels can be considered both pets and pests, depending on the context and location. In certain circumstances, people may keep weasels as pets, whereas, in other situations, weasels can be seen as pests due to their potential negative impact on native wildlife or agricultural lands. Weasels are small, carnivorous mammals that belong to the Mustelidae family, which also includes animals such as otters, ferrets, and badgers. They are endowed with a slender, long body, which makes them adept at navigating through small spaces, and they have a keen sense of smell, sight, and hearing. In the wild, weasels mainly feed on small rodents, which can result in them being considered as pests by farmers and gardeners because they can prey on animals considered as pests themselves. In some places, people keep weasels as pets, particularly the domesticated ferrets, which are closely related to weasels. These animals can make good pets if they are properly socialized and cared for, but they have specific needs and shouldn't be taken in casually. They need a proper diet, a spacious and stimulating environment, and regular exercise and stimulation. Furthermore, it's crucial to check local laws and regulations since there may be restrictions on keeping certain types of weasels or related species as pets. Considering the above information, we can see that the two questions, \\"Are weasels pets or pests?\\" and \\"Should I have a weasel as a pet?\\" do not have the same meaning. The first question, \\"Are weasels pets or pests?\\" is asking if weasels are generally classified as pets or pests. This classification could be determined by their status in a specific region, their interaction with the environment, or their status as domesticated or wild animals. The second question, \\"Should I have a weasel as a pet?\\" is asking for a personal recommendation on whether keeping a weasel as a pet is a good choice for the individual inquiring. This question focuses more on the suitability and appropriateness of keeping a weasel as a pet based on factors such as personal preferences, the individual's lifestyle, and the compatibility of weasels with the person asking the question.

Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.  Paragraph: Red fishery and Brown fishery were both fishing for Patagonian toothfish. Red fishery was fishing illegally, while Brown fishery was regulated and lawful.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fishery did more unreported fishing? Answer:","output":"The Red fishery did more unreported fishing. Justification: The provided paragraph clearly states that Red fishery was fishing illegally, whereas Brown fishery was regulated and lawful.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: coffee beans are falling in a coffee cup in slow motion","output":"In the sentence \\"coffee beans are falling in a coffee cup in slow motion,\\" the most important words are \\"coffee beans,\\" \\"falling,\\" \\"coffee cup,\\" and \\"slow motion.\\" Here's a breakdown of why these words are significant: 1. Coffee beans: This is the main subject of the sentence, and without these words, the meaning of the sentence becomes unclear. \\"Coffee beans\\" refers to the roasted seeds of the Coffea plant, which are the primary ingredient in the popular beverage, coffee. The mention of coffee beans signifies the central topic that the rest of the sentence revolves around. 2. Falling: This word describes the action that the coffee beans are performing. As a verb, \\"falling\\" is an essential component of the sentence, as it illustrates the movement of the coffee beans. Without this word, there would be no information about what the coffee beans are doing, reducing the sentence's informative value. 3. Coffee cup: This phrase provides context and a location for the action taking place. It specifies where the coffee beans are falling, which is important for a reader or listener to conceptualize the situation being described. Removing \\"coffee cup\\" from the sentence eliminates the destination for the falling coffee beans, leaving the action without a clear setting. 4. Slow motion: This phrase is an adverbial expression that modifies the verb \\"falling.\\" It adds detail to the action, conveying that the coffee beans are not falling at a regular speed but at a pace slower than normal. \\"Slow motion\\" enriches the visual imagery of the scene described by the sentence and contributes to the overall atmosphere or mood being depicted. In summary, \\"coffee beans,\\" \\"falling,\\" \\"coffee cup,\\" and \\"slow motion\\" are the most critical words in the sentence as they establish the primary subject, action, location, and pace of the events described, thus providing a clear and vivid picture to the reader or listener."},{"instruction":"Definition: Given a sentence, generate a new sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

What is the answer for the question: Who tell the story of a storm that killed everyone else aboard? from the following article ?  A USCG pilot and his winchman Haig answer an SOS call at sea and arrive at a derelict schooner, the Requite. Haig lowers himself to the ship, where he finds three dead bodies along with one survivor, Eva, cowering in the cabin. As the pilot attempts to retrieve Haig and Eva with a rescue basket, the line breaks, plunging the two into the ocean.  After they swim back to the boat, the pilot informs Haig that he must return to base because his fuel is borderline.  Eva and Haig spend the night on the boat, during which time she recounts the story of the storm that killed everyone else aboard. She explains to him that the strange events began soon after they found a priest drifting in the ocean, apparently a survivor of a disaster. Then, she tells Haig of the violent storm that caused all of the freakish deaths on the boat. One man was hurled through a hatch; one is hanging from the ship's mast; another vanished before her eyes; and a fourth man is in an aft compartment, floating in the air. Eva attributes the deaths to supernatural causes, but Haig has a practical explanation for everything, including the man who appears to be floating in the air.  Early the next morning, the pilot returns along with the Coast Guard cutter Venturous.  Haig and Eva are transferred from the Requite to the deck of the Venturous, where they board the helicopter for the flight back to Miami.

Pick from: + reduce the cost of the watch.; + provide an energy source for the watch.; + make the watch more attractive.; + stop the watch from speeding up.;","output":"The correct answer to the question is: + provide an energy source for the watch. A watch with a small solar cell on its face is designed to harness energy from sunlight or artificial light, converting it into electrical energy to power the watch. This innovative approach to powering a watch has several benefits, which will be discussed in detail below. 1. Eco-friendliness: Solar-powered watches are environmentally friendly, as they use a renewable energy source rather than relying on disposable batteries. This reduces the overall carbon footprint of the watch, making it a more sustainable choice for environmentally conscious consumers. 2. Low maintenance: Since solar watches do not use conventional batteries, there is no need to replace batteries periodically. This is beneficial for both the user (who avoids the inconvenience and cost of battery replacement) and the environment (reducing waste from discarded batteries). 3. Longevity: Solar cells on watches are designed to last for an extended period, often outlasting the watch's typical life expectancy. As a result, solar-powered watches generally have longer lifespans than their non-solar counterparts. 4. Reliability: Solar-powered watches are engineered to store energy efficiently, ensuring that they maintain consistent power even in low-light conditions or when not exposed to light for extended periods. The energy storage capability ensures that the watch will continue to function reliably in various environments. While the primary function of the solar cell in a watch is to provide an energy source, the other given options do not accurately describe its main purpose. - Reduce the cost of the watch: Although solar cells can reduce the need for battery replacements, solar-powered watches often have a higher initial cost due to the solar technology integrated into the design. However, the long-term savings from avoiding battery replacements and the watch's longevity may outweigh the initial costs. - Make the watch more attractive: While some might find a solar-powered watch aesthetically appealing due to its innovative technology, the attractiveness of a watch is subjective and not the primary function of the solar cell. - Stop the watch from speeding up: The solar cell's main purpose is to provide a continuous energy source for the watch, not regulate the timekeeping accuracy. The accuracy of the watch is determined mainly by the quality of the watch's internal mechanism and not directly by the solar cell. In conclusion, the primary function of the solar cell on a watch is to provide an energy source for the watch. This offers various benefits, including eco-friendliness, low maintenance, longevity, and reliability, and makes solar-powered watches a sustainable and innovative choice for consumers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Logging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. By 1910, Seattle was one of the 25 largest cities in the country. However, the Great Depression severely damaged the city's economy. Growth returned during and after World War II, due partially to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed as a technology center beginning in the 1980s, with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region. In 1994 the Internet retail giant Amazon was founded in Seattle. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000.  Seattle (i/siˈætəl/) is a West Coast seaport city and the seat of King County. With an estimated 662,400 residents as of 2015[update], Seattle is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. In July 2013 it was the fastest-growing major city in the United States, and remained in the top five in May 2015 with an annual growth rate of 2.1%. The Seattle metropolitan area of around 3.6 million inhabitants is the 15th largest metropolitan area in the United States.

A gunman who was persuaded by a bookkeeper to surrender during a 2013 gun battle with police at a school near Atlanta pleaded guilty to multiple charges Tuesday and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Michael Brandon Hill, 21, entered the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy near Decatur on Aug. 20, 2013, armed with a rifle patterned after an AK-47 and nearly 500 bullets, according to police. He repeatedly fired at police from inside the school before school bookkeeper Antoinette Tuff persuaded him to surrender. Tuff said later that she prayed as she tried to persuade him against further violence. No one was hurt in the gunfire.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  In the lungs, oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. Oxygen (about 98 percent) binds reversibly to the respiratory pigment hemoglobin found in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs carry oxygen to the tissues where oxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells of the tissues. More specifically, alveolar P O 2.   Choices:  - blood  - neurons  - cillia  - capillaries   A: A:","output":"The correct option is capillaries. In the lungs, oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. The alveoli are small, grape-like air sacs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place. They are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, which are the smallest blood vessels in the body. Capillaries have thin walls that allow the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and the surrounding tissues. As you breathe in, air containing oxygen flows into the lungs and reaches the alveoli. Oxygen molecules in the alveoli then diffuse across the moist alveolar surface through their thin walls and into the surrounding capillaries. This process of gas exchange is known as diffusion, and it occurs because the oxygen concentration in the alveoli is higher than in the deoxygenated blood inside the capillaries. Once oxygen molecules enter the capillaries, about 98 percent of them bind to a respiratory pigment called hemoglobin, which is found in red blood cells (RBCs). Hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the various tissues and cells in the body. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin due to a partial pressure difference, which is often denoted as alveolar P O 2. As RBCs carrying oxygen-rich blood travel through the systemic circulation, they reach tissues with a lower concentration of oxygen. The partial pressure of oxygen in the tissues is lower than in the blood, causing oxygen to dissociate from hemoglobin and diffuse into the cells. This process provides cells with the oxygen they need for energy production through cellular respiration. To summarize, the correct answer is capillaries, as oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries in the lungs for transport to other parts of the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Xbox One gaming console has received updates from Microsoft since its launch in 2013 that enable it to play select games from its two predecessor consoles, Xbox and Xbox 360. On June 15, 2015, backward compatibility with supported Xbox 360 games became available to eligible Xbox Preview program users with a beta update to the Xbox One system software. The dashboard update containing backward compatibility was released publicly on November 12, 2015. On October 24, 2017, another such update added games from the original Xbox library. The following is a list of all backward compatible games on Xbox One under this functionality. See options at the end. Can we conclude that does an xbox one play xbox 360 games? OPTIONS:  -no  -yes","output":"Yes, Xbox One can play Xbox 360 games. This is due the backward compatibility feature that was introduced to the Xbox One console by Microsoft. On June 15, 2015, a beta update to the Xbox One system software made backward compatibility with supported Xbox 360 games available to eligible Xbox Preview program users. Later, on November 12, 2015, the dashboard update containing backward compatibility was released publicly. Therefore, Xbox One users can now play select games from the Xbox 360, as long as those games are part of the backward compatibility program. Backward compatibility is a hardware or software feature that allows a device like a gaming console to understand and utilize interfaces and data from older versions of software or hardware. In the case of the Xbox One, the backward compatibility feature makes it possible to play certain Xbox 360 games on the newer Xbox One console, providing that the games have been made compatible. The success of this compatibility comes down to whether or not the game is on the list of games updated for compatibility. It should be noted that not all Xbox 360 games can be played on the Xbox One as of now, but the list of compatible games is constantly growing as Microsoft continues to add more titles. Furthermore, on October 24, 2017, Microsoft extended this feature to the games from the original Xbox library by releasing another update. This means that Xbox One also supports a list of games from the original Xbox console making it possible to play select games across all three generations of Xbox console on the Xbox One.

Divorced American Harvey Shine writes jingles for television commercials, a job not in keeping with his one-time aspiration to be a jazz composer and pianist. His position at work is tenuous as he departs for London to attend his daughter Susan's wedding. Upon arrival at Heathrow Airport, he encounters Kate Walker, a single Londoner who collects statistics from passengers as they pass through the terminals. Tired and anxious to get to his hotel, Harvey brusquely dismisses her when she approaches him to ask questions.Harvey is upset to discover his ex-wife Jean rented a house to accommodate family and friends from the States but failed to include him. At the rehearsal dinner on the night preceding the wedding, it becomes increasingly clear Harvey is systematically being excluded from the clan around his ex-wife's new husband Brian and is treated as a mere guest. They fake their politeness towards him and make him feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. When Harvey tells Susan, with whom he has shared a strained relationship since his divorce, that he will be attending the ceremony but not the subsequent reception because he needs to return to the States for an important meeting, she informs him she has asked her stepfather Brian to give her away.Meanwhile, Kate is on a blind date that is not going well. When she returns to the table after taking yet another call from her neurotic mother Maggie, who is certain her Polish neighbor is burying bodies in a shed in his yard, she discovers her date has invited friends to join them. Feeling unwanted and excluded from the conversation, she eventually excuses herself and goes home.The following morning Harvey attends the wedding but quickly leaves for the airport without congratulating the married couple. But due to heavy traffic delays he misses his flight at Heathrow. When he calls his boss Marvin to advise him he will be returning a day later than planned, he is fired. Determined to drown his sorrows, Harvey goes to an airport bar and sees Kate. Recognizing her from the day before, he apologizes for his rude behavior. She initially resists the attention he is paying her but soon they're both glad to finally have an honest conversation about what they're feeling and thinking.Harvey follows Kate to the Heathrow Express and, upon arrival at Paddington station, asks if he can walk her to her writing class on the South Bank. She accepts his offer and is pleased when he offers to meet her after class. As they stroll along the River Thames, Harvey mentions he is missing Susan's wedding reception, and Kate urges him to go. He finally relents, but only if she will accompany him. When Kate insists she is not properly dressed for such an occasion, Harvey buys her a dress and the two head to the Grosvenor House Hotel, where they are welcomed coolly by Susan and get two places at the children's table. When the father of the bride is called upon to make a toast, Brian rises and begins to speak until Harvey interrupts. He then delivers an eloquent speech that redeems him with his daughter and endears him to Kate.Immediately following the first dance of the bride and groom, the groom calls Harvey up to dance with his daughter for the Father-Daughter Dance. He happily does so, and then all the guests join them on the floor for the rumba, tango and other dances, with Harvey enjoying himself on the dance floor, alone. Kate is left at the table, once again in the same position as when she was on her blind date. Her smile becomes more strained as she looks about and sees herself alone at the table in a room of strangers for several dances, Harvey having apparently forgotten she was there. When she surmises he will not be coming to ask her to dance, her smile disappears and she quietly leaves the room and stands in front of the elevator, preparing to leave.Harvey, now looking for Kate, goes into the corridor and seeing her waiting for the elevator, he disappears into a side annex with a piano and begins to softly play one of his own jazz compositions for her. She hears the music and follows it, finding Harvey smiling and waiting for her. He asks her to return to the reception to dance and stay with him. She smiles and agrees.Following the reception, Harvey and Kate walk and talk until dawn. They exchange a single, gentle kiss and agree to meet at noon. At his hotel, Harvey experiences serious heart palpitations and is rushed to the hospital, where he receives a call from Marvin who, having discovered his employee is more indispensable than he thought, urges him to return to work as soon as possible. Harvey decides he prefers to remain in London and explore the possibility of a relationship with Kate. He tracks her down at her writing class and reveals why he missed their rendezvous. Overcautious about romance because of so many past disappointments, Kate initially resists his suggestion that they see what the future might bring them, but finally agrees to give things a chance.As they slowly stroll away, Harvey invites Kate to ask him the questions she would have asked him at the airport terminal, and this time, he happily answers, telling her his place of residence \\"...is in transition.\\"","output":"Question: What job does Harvey Shine have?

But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

Answer based on context: The Tolui family successfully enthroned their candidate for Great Khan, Möngke, in the kurultais of 1250 and 1251.  The Ögedeid candidate for Great Khan, Shiremun, and his cousin Nakhu, were embittered by their loss and plotted a failed assassination of Möngke.  Möngke took revenge by purging his opponents in the royal house, and members of both the Chagatai and Ögedei families. Möngke handed control over the Caucasus region to the Golden Horde in 1252.  With the approval of Möngke, Berke succeeded his brother, Batu, as Khan of the Golden Horde in Russia in 1255.  Hulagu of the Ilkhanate seized control of the Caucasus from the Golden Horde, and his sacking of Baghdad  in 1258 angered Berke, a convert to Islam.  Möngke Khan died in 1259 without appointing a successor. He likely favored Ariq Böke, whom Möngke designated in 1258 as commander of Karakorum , but he did little else to secure Ariq Böke's claim to the throne.

Read this article and answer this question Coming off their bye week, the Vikings went to Soldier Field for a Week 6 NFC North contest against the Chicago Bears. In the first quarter, Minnesota trailed early as Devin Hester returned a punt 89 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings responded with a 60-yard touchdown pass from Tarvaris Jackson to Troy Williamson. In the second quarter, Chicago's Brian Griese completed a 39-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian. Afterwards, Minnesota answered with a 67-yard touchdown run from Adrian Peterson. In the third quarter, the Vikings took the lead with 73-yard touchdown run from Peterson for the only score of the period. Kickers Ryan Longwell and Robbie Gould traded field goals of 48 and 32 yards to start the fourth quarter, before Peterson scored his third touchdown of the game on a 35-yard run. Chicago tied the game again with Griese completing a 33-yard touchdown pass to Muhsin Muhammad, followed by an 81-yard touchdown pass to Hester. But on the ensuing kickoff, Peterson sprinted all the way down to the Chicago 38-yard line, setting Longwell up for a 55-yard, game-winning field goal. With the win, the Vikings improved to 2-3, largely in part to Peterson's 224 rushing yards, which put him fifth for the most rookie rushing yards in one game. Up to this point, he had a total of 607 rushing yards, which placed him second for the most rookie rushing yards through the first five games, only behind Eric Dickerson. He also broke the NFL record for most all purpose yards in a single game, with 361. How many TD pass yards did Griese complete?","output":"Brian Griese, the quarterback for the Chicago Bears, completed two touchdown passes in this particular game against the Minnesota Vikings. The first pass was a 39-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian, while the second was a 33-yard touchdown pass to Muhsin Muhammad. The third touchdown of the Bears was an 81-yard touchdown by Devin Hester, but the text does not specify if it was a pass from Griese. Therefore, considering the available information, we can accurately calculate that Griese completed a total of 72 yards (39 yards + 33 yards) for touchdown passes in this game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the premise \\"A man in shorts and a black jacket stands on top of a big rock looking down on hills and valleys.\\" true if \\"The man is on a mountain.\\"?","output":"If we analyze the given information, we have two separate statements to consider: 1. A man in shorts and a black jacket stands on top of a big rock looking down on hills and valleys. 2. The man is on a mountain. To determine if the premise is true when considering the information in the second statement, we need to examine the possible interpretations and make some assumptions to establish a clear connection between the two statements. First, let's define the keywords in each statement: Man: A male person Shorts: A type of clothing worn on the lower part of the body Black jacket: A dark-colored, long-sleeve upper-body garment Big rock: A massive, solid mineral formation Hills: Elevated landforms that are smaller than a mountain and less steep than a mountain Valleys: Low areas located between hills or mountains Mountain: A large natural elevation of the Earth's surface, steeper than a hill and often having a peak or summit Now, let's analyze the possible connections between the statements. A. The big rock is part of the mountain. If the big rock the man is standing on is an integral part of the mountain, we could argue that the premise is true. In this case, the man is standing on top of a big rock that forms part of the mountain's structure, and he is looking down on nearby hills and valleys. B. The mountain is separate from the hills and valleys he is looking down at. In this interpretation, the man is on top of a big rock, which is on a mountain, and he is looking down on separate hills and valleys. This scenario also supports the truth of the premise, as the man's location on the mountain does not contradict the fact that he is looking at hills and valleys. C. The hills and valleys are part of the mountain. If the hills and valleys the man is looking at are part of the same mountain he is on, this may slightly alter the premise but does not necessarily make it false, as mountains often have undulating terrain with smaller hills or depressions creating valleys. The man, in this case, would still be on a mountain, standing on the big rock, and looking at different features of that mountain. Based on these interpretations and possible connections, it is reasonable to conclude that the premise \\"A man in shorts and a black jacket stands on top of a big rock looking down on hills and valleys\\" is valid and can be considered true if \\"The man is on a mountain.\\" The two statements do not conflict with each other, and various interpretations allow us to establish a logical connection between them. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that these interpretations are based on several assumptions and a limited level of accuracy within the language used."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: who wrote the we are the world song?","output":"\\"We Are the World\\" is a charity single that was written by American musicians Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. The song was produced by renowned music producer Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian and was recorded by the supergroup USA for Africa in 1985. The purpose of the song was to raise awareness and funds for the African famine relief efforts happening at the time. The idea for \\"We Are the World\\" originated from the success of the British charity single \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" written by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure for the group Band Aid in 1984. Inspired by this effort, singer and activist Harry Belafonte decided to create a similar project in the US to contribute to the cause. He reached out to his manager, Ken Kragen, who was managing Lionel Richie at the time, with the idea of creating a benefit song featuring a superstar lineup. Kragen enlisted the help of his client Lionel Richie to co-write the song with another renowned musician, Michael Jackson. The two songwriters came together, working on the lyrics and melody at the former's home in Beverly Hills. They developed the song in a matter of days, and with Quincy Jones on board as the producer, they began assembling an incredible lineup of the most celebrated artists and musicians of the era. The final recording of \\"We Are the World\\" took place at A&M Recording Studios in Hollywood on January 28, 1985. Dozens of notable artists gathered to lend their voices to the track, including Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Tina Turner, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, Ray Charles, and many others. The single was released on March 7, 1985, and rapidly gained international success. \\"We Are the World\\" went on to raise over 63 million for African famine relief, becoming one of the best-selling singles worldwide at the time. It won numerous awards, including three Grammy Awards, one American Music Award, and a People's Choice Award. Moreover, it was recognized as a critical step in raising awareness about the African famine crisis and exemplifying the power of collaboration through music. The song's lasting impact is still felt today, as it set a precedent for future charity projects and brought attention to global humanitarian crises."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

As your trainee progresses in their training, allow them to take the lead on certain tasks and projects. Start by having them take care of the daily routine without your help. Then, when you feel comfortable with their ability to handle the day-to-day, allow them to take lead on a particular project or project component.  There is no set time frame for when any one trainee should be taking lead on anything. Look at what your training schedule will allow. If you have a few weeks to work with your trainee, you may want to focus the last week on getting them independent. If you only have a few days, this may need to happen faster. Allowing them to take lead should mean that you are removing yourself from the process. Offer to assist your trainee if they want or need it, but otherwise leave it to them to perform the job functions. As you transition your position to your trainee, introduce them to other people who may be of help in completing their job. Look at those coworkers with whom you have worked in your position, and introduce your employee, explaining how, specifically, they may work with this person in the future.  Make sure your trainee has the phone numbers, email addresses and any other contact information they may need to get in touch with these new contacts on their own. If possible, try to arrange coffee or lunch so that your trainee can really get to know the person and their job functions, rather than just stopping by their desk. At some point before your trainee is completely on their own, you should schedule to stop performing your current job functions. If you are able, you may want to turn your attention toward your new position. Let your trainee take over the position while you still have training time with them so you are there in case they need help.  Let your trainee know well in advance when you plan to have them fully assume the position. Explain to them, “I will be there if you need help or if something comes up that we haven’t covered yet, but otherwise you are going to be taking on the job completely.” Let your supervisor know in advance, as well, and have them communicate with trainee first starting that day. At the end of the training period, do a final performance review with the trainee. This should primarily address their strength and growth, and place secondary emphasis on where they need to improve.  Ask your supervisor if they would like to sit in on this process to offer their praise and constructive criticism, as well. If you do talk to your trainee about areas where they may need to improve, do so through constructive criticism. Let them know that they are on the right track, and give them specific points of improvement on which to focus. Talk to your trainee about where they can seek additional training if they feel there is any area they want to strengthen. Provide them with names and contact information of resources both internal and external to your company. Once the training period has ended, stop performing your old job duties. If you are able, allow your trainee to come to you with questions as they assume the position. Do not, however, have others within your organization demand you perform functions that should be done by your trainee.  If you move to a different position in your current organization, talk to your new supervisor and let them know that you are being asked to perform tasks from your old position. See if they can speak with your old manager about transitioning responsibilities to your trainee. If you are leaving your organization, you are likely under no obligation to continue performing work them. Simply let your former employer know that while you appreciated your time with their company, you are not in a place to complete those job functions anymore. Summary:","output":"1.

During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was Jeux, with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it \\"asinine\\", while Debussy felt that \\"Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds\\". The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps. Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano: I decided then and there that the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms were the only music for me, not the music of this crazy Russian. ... My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head. Then [Diaghilev] turned to me and with a smile said, \\"This is a masterpiece, Monteux, which will completely revolutionize music and make you famous, because you are going to conduct it.\\" And, of course, I did. Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, \\"I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now.\\" However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was \\"now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring\\". A:","output":"The name of the person that needed a quiet corner to rest his aching head is Pierre Monteux.

Process:  - The liver takes in blood from the rest of the body - The liver uses enzymes to clean the blood - The cleaned blood is expelled - The liver creates bile from the items filtered - The liver takes energy and stores it as glycogen - The bile is sent to the intestines.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are more women and men happens, how will it affect the liver having to work HARDER.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"The supposed perturbation of having more women than men in the population does not have a direct effect on the liver function or its workload. However, there may be indirect effects in terms of general population health trends and lifestyle habits, which can have varying impacts on liver function. These indirect effects can be analyzed from different perspectives. Firstly, let's consider the hormonal differences between women and men. Women naturally produce different levels of hormones, such as estrogen, which can influence liver function. Estrogen has been known to offer some protection against liver diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcohol-related liver disease. With a higher population of women in comparison to men, the overall prevalence of these liver diseases may be lower due to the protective role of estrogen. However, during pregnancy, women may experience gestational diabetes, which can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and subsequent liver diseases in the long run. Hence, an increased population of women might result in higher instances of gestational diabetes and related liver issues, which could lead to increased liver workload. Secondly, lifestyle factors play a crucial role in liver health. Studies have shown some differences in lifestyle habits between men and women. Generally, men are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, which are known to be detrimental to liver health. If there are more women than men in the population, and these trends hold, we could expect an overall reduction in these risk factors for liver disease, translating to a decreased workload on the liver at the population level. However, this is predicated on the assumption that existing gender-based trends in these behaviors continue. Another perspective to consider is healthcare utilization and disease prevention. Women are generally more likely to seek healthcare services and engage in preventive healthcare practices. With more women in the population, there may be an overall rise in awareness and implementation of health-promoting behaviors, which could indirectly influence general liver health and workload. However, healthcare systems must be strong enough to support the increased demand, ensuring everyone has access to the necessary resources and preventive measures. The perturbation hypothesis in question assumes that the liver will have to work harder with more women than men in the population. However, the direct and indirect effects of such a shift are more complex and influenced by various factors that may not necessarily lead to increased liver workload. Hormones, lifestyle habits, and healthcare utilization all play a role in determining the impact of such a population change on liver function. Overall, the connection between population gender composition and liver workload is multifaceted, and it would be an oversimplification to presume that an increased population of women would directly result in the liver having to work harder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. When glider pilots look at the sky and see lenticular clouds, they know the flying will be good. The stationary, lens-shaped clouds - often mistaken for UFOs - tend to provide very smooth and strong lift, enabling gliders to fly vast distances. Skilled pilots can surf these \\"waves\\" in the sky for hours - until the lift or the light runs out. On Wednesday, strong north-westerly winds set up a series of giant \\"ripples\\" across the skies of Scotland and two pilots managed to break through the 1,000km (621 miles) barrier. John Williams, who lives near Scotlandwell in Perth and Kinross, said it was an \\"exceptionally good wave day\\" - the sort of day that only comes along every few years. He took off from the Scottish Gliding Centre's Portmoak airfield in his Antares glider at 06:50 and remained in the air for 11 hours and 38 minutes. He flew 1,684km - \\"which nicely puts it just over a thousand miles\\" - harnessing the power of the atmosphere alone. \\"When you get a wind from the north-west blowing across the mountains of Scotland, you get big ripples in the air set up. That's when you see these long, white lenticular clouds,\\" he told the BBC. \\"You can fly right along the edge of these clouds, just like a surfer on a beach. It's great fun.\\" The 63-year-old flew up to Killin, by Loch Tay, and then on to Aberdeenshire. He repeated the Killin to Aberdeenshire leg three times before flipping around and returning to his home airfield. \\"My first leg was a bit slower than I was hoping for, so I thought, I could do better than that, so I tried it again,\\" he said. \\"And then I tried it again which is a bit unusual.\\" His average speed on the middle run, which was the fastest, was 184km/h (114mph). To an untrained eye, it might appear that glider pilots are randomly floating around, but they're actually engaged in a constant search for lift and the best line to take them further and faster. It's something that becomes even more critical at the speeds Mr Williams was travelling. The pilot said he finds it an \\"endlessly fascinating\\" mental challenge, and one which enables him to concentrate hard for long periods of time. Mr Williams already holds the UK gliding distance record - 1,108km (688 miles) - which he set almost exactly 10 years ago. He said Wednesday's feat will not count as an official UK record, as the rules state you cannot repeat legs during the flight. But his achievement has still been noted as a \\"significant achievement\\" by members of the UK gliding community. \\"John is an exceptional pilot,\\" says Sant Cervantes, who holds four UK gliding records. \\"He's set the bar for people like myself to follow.\\" Mr Cervantes, 66, set off from Portmoak in a much smaller glider on Wednesday. He spent less time in the air, but still managed to fly 1,009km (627 miles) and reached an altitude of 13,000ft (3,962m). He followed a similar route to Mr Williams, who said it was the first time anyone had achieved such a distance in a glider that size. Mr Cervantes, a retired airline pilot, said there were only a handful of days each year which delivered really good wave days. But Scotland has more days like this than many countries and is generally recognised as having some of the best gliding conditions in Europe - which is why many committed gliders end up moving here. Mr Cervantes came to Scotland in 1972 and Mr Williams in 1997. Both of them now live conveniently close to the Portmoak airfield and devote much of their time to the world of gliding. \\"Your glider is extension of your personality,\\" Mr Cervantes told the BBC. \\"What you've got out there is an ocean of air and each day is different. It's a voyage of discovery - of the sky and yourself.\\" Each flight might be different, but days like Wednesday can live in a pilot's memory for a long time, the 66-year-old said. \\"If you're competent then you get in the zone like an athlete. You've got the conditions, you've got the glider and you've got yourself. \\"When you get it right you feel like you're in harmony with the environment. You're on a knife edge and you just shoot along. It's fantastic.\\"","output":"Two glider pilots surfed lenticular clouds for hours, breaking the 1,000km distance barrier over Scotland, taking advantage of exceptionally good wave conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mendes, who won a best director Oscar for 1999's American Beauty, told fans that Skyfall would have all the features of a classic Bond movie, such as a lot of action. \\"Daniel Craig is back for a third time as 007 along with Dame Judi Dench as his boss Miss M.\\" said Mendes. Many famous actors and actresses who have Oscar wins and nominations  are included, but the filmmakers remain keeping their roles in the film secret. Producers are showing no signs of cutting off the cost of Skyfall. \\"It is at the same level as the 2008's Quantum of Solace, which cost about 200m. The film will be made in the Whitehall,  Scotland, China and Turkey, as well as Pinewood Studios.\\" Said a producer. Why has 007 been popular for so long? Professor James Chapman of Leicester University, the author of the book A Cultural History of the James Bond Films, said, \\"They manage to let each new film meet the changes not just in society but in the popular taste of film culture. That lets each generation get their own Bond.\\" The task of James Bond in the new James Bond film is to  _  .

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  Paragraph: Two cities situated on the shores of a large ocean polluted it in different ways.  Truck city had an economy that was based on tourism, while Farm city was based on agriculture.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city caused fewer dead zones? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it cannot be definitively determined which city caused fewer dead zones. While Farm City's agricultural activities might contribute to marine pollution through fertilizer chemicals and waste, Truck City's tourism economy might generate marine debris or litter that affects the ocean.

The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death. Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Who is vicious towards Louis?\\" is Church, Ellie's reanimated cat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the album release that Chris Richards called \\"rock-and-roll as dystopian junk mail\\"? , can you please find it?   Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign.

With this release strategy, Apple CEO Tim Cook referred to it as \\"the largest album release of all time\\". The album was made available to over 500 million iTunes customers and Apple even spent US100 million on a promotional campaign for it. Songs of Innocence was born out of multiple album projects U2 worked on during their 360° Tour. One of these was a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse, which later formed the foundation of Songs of Innocence. The band worked with Danger Mouse until May 2013 before bringing in additional producers like Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood to contribute to the album. In late 2013, the band momentarily paused their work on the album to create \\"Ordinary Love\\" for the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. This song, written in honor of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Songs of Innocence delves into the band members' youth in Ireland, touching on topics such as childhood experiences, personal loves and losses, and paying tribute to their early musical influences. This album served as a reflection on their journey as individuals and musicians, creating an introspective and personal work.

Underlying UK and Ireland sales were up 4.6%, but rose just 0.1% in France.

Earlier this year, Kingfisher said it would close 60 B&Q stores. However, it is increasing the number of Screwfix stores, where sales have been growing much faster. Like-for-like sales at B&Q were up 2.4% in the three months to the end of October, while Screwfix sales jumped 13.3%. However, the weaker housing market in France affected sales there. Castorama sales slipped 0.2% on a like-for-like basis, although they rose 0.4% at Brico Depot. \\"Today's update from Kingfisher highlights a typically mixed bag of results,\\" said David Alexander, consultant at retail analysts Conlumino. \\"While it is making progress in the UK, amid an improving consumer context, sales in France were disappointing, with the group drawing attention to the slow growth of house building across the Channel as a key factor underpinning its lacklustre performance.\\" He said it was still \\"early days\\" for Ms Laury's new strategy for Kingfisher, but added: \\"Given the difficulties B&Q continues to face in adapting to the new shape of DIY demand and the unfavourable economic climate in France, progress so far has been acceptable.\\" Summary:","output":"Kingfisher, a big company that owns stores like B&Q and Screwfix in the UK, and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, made less money this quarter than they did last quarter.

They are handled as property and are forced to work in industries that range from the prostitution run by organised criminal gangs to making bricks for the glittering hotels and shopping malls of emerging economies. The ILO estimates that 21 million people are in forced labour worldwide, creating a staggering annual revenue of 150bn (Â£90bn; 110bn euros) - which exceeds the gross domestic product of many developing countries. But none of the illegal profits go into the pockets of the workers, or are paid as tax revenue, says the ILO. More than 40bn has been traced to everyday industries such as construction and agriculture that feeds straight into the global economy. The ILO was created in 1919 in the aftermath of World War One to draw a direct link between the treatment of people and conflict. Its mission statement declares that lasting peace can only be accomplished if it is based on social justice. The ILO's original Forced Labour Convention was drawn up in 1930 and it aimed primarily at preventing governments - many of them then colonial - from abusing their workers. It states that signatories must suppress the use of forced and compulsory labour in all its forms. This week's reforms reflect the shift of economic control over the decades from governments to the private sector and its supply chains. They follow the introduction three years ago of fresh guidelines from the UN and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that address human rights issues in the business world - together with laws, mainly in the US, aimed at holding to account companies whose products might be traceable to forced labour. All this marks a new direction in international thinking, although campaigners say it still does not go far enough. They argue that the global private sector has shown very little initiative on the challenges of modern slavery and that there remains too much contrast between the upbeat photo-op smiles of workers on corporate web sites and the fear, violence and hunger enveloping those at the very bottom of their supply chains. \\"Some companies get it, but many do not,\\" says Peter McAllister of the Ethical Trading Initiative, which is funded by businesses to advise on social responsibility. The revelations of conditions for migrant workers in Qatar on World Cup construction - an event very much in the public spotlight - shed a light on allegations of human rights violations against workers. Evidence from activists and academics runs through a much wider arc. More than a decade after a slate of famous chocolate companies promised the US Congress to eradicate child labour on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast, children are still working openly, often trafficked far away from their families. Last year, central American governments were given special European Union concessions to import sugar while child workers cut cane under the watch of threatening security guards on the payroll of the big sugar companies. In India, illiterate young slave girls work in airless cotton factories breathing in a dust that is known as the \\"horror of the white cloud\\". By the time they turn 20, their lungs will be damaged permanently. None of this is difficult to unearth, bringing into question the effectiveness of the raft of laws and agreements that have been introduced over the decades. Before this week's revised convention, the ILO had introduced a Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention in 1999. In 1926, the League of Nations drew up the Slavery Convention and its successor, the UN, amended it in 1956 to clarify the definition of modern slavery. Many governments supported these moves by bringing in their own laws. India, for example, banned forced labour in 1976 under its Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act. Yet today, India presides over by far the biggest number of victims - an estimated 10 million. Contractors operate openly as they trade people and families, transporting them to work in the cotton, brick and other industries that feed India's economy. The stories told by those who have been freed or escape are widespread and horrendous. Workers are kept in check by a wall of fear and threats that reach right back into their villages. Activists say one mechanism to ensure obedience is for a woman to be gang-raped in front of her husband and children. Beatings are common. Pregnant women are kicked in their stomachs. Malnutrition and disease are widespread. It will take some time to see how much impact the updated ILO convention will have. But the reform itself marks an acceptance in recent years that many governments in the developing world have weak institutions that are incapable or unwilling to uphold the law. Therefore, more responsibility must fall on businesses, particularly the global multi-nationals, whose institutions are strong enough to force a way forward. Most say they have zero tolerance to human rights abuse in their supply chains. Activists would like those promises opened to public scrutiny. What was that article about?","output":"This article is about the problem of modern slavery, where millions of workers are treated like property and forced to work in different industries like construction, agriculture, and even prostitution. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that 21 million people are in forced labor worldwide, making a lot of money for some businesses but not helping the workers themselves. The ILO tries to stop this bad treatment of workers by making rules and agreements, but there are still many problems. Some companies don't do enough to make sure their workers are treated well. The article mentions examples from different countries where workers are still being badly treated, even though there are rules against it. It talks about how it will take time to see if new rules can make a difference, but it's important for businesses to take more responsibility and treat their workers better."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Dougie brings Satan home, whom everyone believes to be Alex.

When Satan and Dougie leave to get Halloween candy, they end up shoplifting a market for candy and tools, where Satan subsequently kills a bagger who tries to stop them and the two engage in a brief physical assault spree with their shopping cart. On the way home, Satan engages in a combination of assaulting and killing several more people, including Alex's estranged dad, before he and Dougie are accosted by the police.

Question: \\"Which botanist wrote Darwiniana, a collection of essays that defended the theory of evolution?\\"  Context: \\"Scientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \\"law of development\\" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The botanist who wrote \\"Darwiniana,\\" a collection of essays defending the theory of evolution, was Asa Gray. Asa Gray was an American botanist, who is often considered one of the most important scientific figures of the 19th century and a close friend of Charles Darwin. He was a strong advocate for Darwin's ideas in the United States, actively promoting the theory of evolution. The context provided discusses how the scientific community was gradually coming to accept the idea of evolution through natural laws during the mid-19th century. Although the theories of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and the \\"law of development\\" proposed in Robert Chambers' \\"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\\" had not gained widespread acceptance, Charles Darwin's publication of \\"On the Origin of Species\\" in 1859 offered a more scientifically robust explanation for evolution through the theory of natural selection. Darwin's work emphasized the importance of empirical evidence and rigorous scientific investigation. As a result, it found support among scientists who followed the empiricist approach endorsed by John Stuart Mill's \\"A System of Logic.\\" However, it faced opposition from those who adhered to the idealist principles championed by William Whewell's \\"Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences,\\" which maintained a belief in the divinely ordained fixity of species. Early supporters of Darwin's ideas included prominent field naturalists such as Joseph Dalton Hooker and Asa Gray, as well as biogeographers and ecologists who observed the natural world. Hooker was a close confidant of Darwin and provided critical support for his theories as early as 1860. Gray, on the other hand, came to support Darwin's ideas after their publication in 1859 and began to defend the theory of evolution in various essays, which were later compiled into the book \\"Darwiniana\\" in 1876. In addition to these figures, other researchers like Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace also contributed to the growing body of evidence supporting the theory of evolution. Bates' work on insect mimicry, published in 1861, offered a compelling example of natural selection in action. Wallace, a co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection, utilized his research in the Malay Archipelago to provide further evidence for evolution, including an 1864 paper proposing an evolutionary explanation for the biogeographical boundary later known as the Wallace Line. In conclusion, the botanist behind \\"Darwiniana,\\" a collection of essays defending the theory of evolution, is Asa Gray. His writings and efforts to support Darwin's ideas played a pivotal role in the acceptance of the theory of evolution among the scientific community during the 19th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In terms of more detail, the statement seems to pertain to an event where high ranking officials from Serbia and Macedonia convened for a meeting. The Serbian Chief of General Staff, Zdravko Ponos, who leads their armed forces, had visited Skopje, the capital city of Macedonia. This visit was initiated on a Monday, specifically the 3rd of September. The exact year is not mentioned but it would have been in the recent past since the individuals named are contemporary figures. In Skopje, Zdravko Ponos had a meeting with significant figures from the defense realm of Macedonia. First of these figures is Miroslav Stojanovski, who, being mentioned as a 'counterpart', indicates that he probably holds a similar high-ranking military position in Macedonia as Ponos does in Serbia. Since Ponos is the Chief of the General Staff of Serbia, we can expect Stojanovski to hold a comparable role within Macedonia, indicating a level of parity between the two when it comes to their professional standings. Also present in this gathering was Lazar Elenovski, who is mentioned as the Defense Minister. The defense minister typically has a crucial role in handling defense and military policies of a country. Therefore, Elenovski would be directly in charge of Macedonia's defense affairs. Given these details, one can extrapolate that this meeting likely pertained to matters of defense and military significance, perhaps border security, joint operations or policy alignment. The meeting could have also addressed international relations between Serbia and Macedonia, alignment of interests, or cooperation in shared goals within their region. Military officials conducting such meetings usually indicates a level of rapport and cooperation between the respective nations, suggesting a positive relationship between Serbia and Macedonia during this time.

Jurgen Klopp's team dominated at Anfield and took the lead as Sadio Mane steered in Roberto Firmino's dinked cross. Philippe Coutinho added a second when he picked up the ball from Mane, cut inside Baggies defender Gareth McAuley and shot into the bottom corner. A two-goal victory would have taken Liverpool top, but McAuley denied them first place when he smashed in a late goal after the hosts failed to clear a corner. Nevertheless, the victory extended their unbeaten run to nine games in all competitions to leave them second in the Premier League table, behind leaders Arsenal on goal difference. Liverpool have scored 20 times in the Premier League this season - more than anyone else - despite England international Daniel Sturridge failing to score in his seven league outings. He did not feature as he was dropped to the substitutes' bench at Anfield, but was not missed as his side dominated, having 21 shots on goal and 68% of possession. Liverpool had further chances but Adam Lallana, recalled in place of Sturridge, curled over the bar and James Milner also headed off target. The Baggies had goalkeeper Ben Foster to thank for keeping them in the game in the second half as he acrobatically pushed away Dejan Lovren's header and also did well to save a Roberto Firmino effort. But Liverpool failed to kill off the game and West Brom looked for an improbable equaliser despite previously having little of the ball and creating few chances. Tony Pulis's side had to wait until the 70th minute to have a shot when Nacer Chadli curled an effort over the top and McAuley's late goal came from their only attempt on target. Substitute Hal Robson-Kanu had a late opportunity, but his shot was blocked by Dejan Lovren. Anything other than a Liverpool victory would have been a injustice. West Brom have only scored 10 goals in nine Premier League matches, with Saido Berahino a constant issue for Pulis. The 23-year-old striker, who got 20 goals in all competitions back in 2014-15, has only netted one Premier League goal in 2016 and been placed on a fitness programme after being \\"eight pounds over his ideal weight\\". Yet again, he was not included in West Brom's 18-man squad, but they need their striker back fit with the right attitude quickly. Salomon Rondon struggled to get in the game and Robson-Kanu is yet to score since joining the Baggies in September. Jurgen Klopp has been in charge of Liverpool for just over a year and created an attacking side that is pleasing on the eye and a squad that could challenge for the Premier League title. They only finished eighth last season, but do not have the distraction of European football this year and have made a fantastic start, despite a tough run of games. In their nine league matches in 2016-17, they have played four of the current top seven - Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United - as well as defending champions Leicester. They now have what appears to be, on paper at least, a favourable run of fixtures, with their next seven matches against sides all outside of the top seven. One major concern for Klopp would be their inability to kill off this game, and the late goal they conceded means they have have kept just one clean sheet in their last 11 Premier League games. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \\"I am happy with the performance of my team. It is difficult against West Brom, so many balls in the air and they are so dangerous from set pieces. \\"It would have been a joke if we had drawn today, it was unbelievable how we played. It was a good performance against a team like this. They were here to get something, but we never let them back into the game. \\"Their corners kicks are so good, I had a feeling that 15 players in white kit were in the box.

We made changes, freshened it up and caused them problems. \\"You know if you get a goal it puts them on the back foot and it is a shame it didn't come earlier. \\"We lack certain qualities we are looking for.

Given those answer options, answer the question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

You are given a new situation: Two meteorologists study Earth's climate. Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress.  and a hint : Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.

Joseph Conrad (Polish pronunciation: ['juzef ,kon.rad]; born Jozef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski; 3 December 1857 - 3 August 1924) was a Polish-British writer regarded as one of the greatest novelists to write in the English language. He joined the British merchant marine in 1878, and was granted British citizenship in 1886. Though he did not speak English fluently until his twenties, he was a master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into English literature. He wrote stories and novels, many with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an impassive, inscrutable universe. After the publication of Chance in 1913, Conrad was the subject of more discussion and praise than any other English writer of the time. He had a genius for companionship, and his circle of friends, which he had begun assembling even prior to his first publications, included authors and other leading lights in the arts, such as Henry James, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, John Galsworthy, Edward Garnett, Garnett's wife Constance Garnett (translator of Russian literature), Stephen Crane, Hugh Walpole, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Norman Douglas, Jacob Epstein, T. E. Lawrence, Andre Gide, Paul Valery, Maurice Ravel, Valery Larbaud, Saint-John Perse, Edith Wharton, James Huneker, anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski, Jozef Retinger (later a founder of the European Movement, which led to the European Union, and author of Conrad and His Contemporaries). Conrad encouraged and mentored younger writers. In the early 1900s he composed a short series of novels in collaboration with Ford Madox Ford.  In 1919 and 1922 Conrad's growing renown and prestige among writers and critics in continental Europe fostered his hopes for a Nobel Prize in Literature. Interestingly, it was apparently the French and Swedes - not the English - who favoured Conrad's candidacy.  In April 1924 Conrad, who possessed a hereditary Polish status of nobility and coat-of-arms (Nalecz), declined a (non-hereditary) British knighthood offered by Labour Party Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.  Conrad kept a distance from official structures -- he never voted in British national elections -- and seems to have been averse to public honours generally; he had already refused honorary degrees from Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, and Yale universities.  In the Polish People's Republic, translations of Conrad's works were openly published, except for Under Western Eyes, which in the 1980s was published as an underground \\"bibula\\".  Conrad's narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many authors, including T. S. Eliot, Maria Dabrowska, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Gerald Basil Edwards, Ernest Hemingway, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, Andre Malraux, George Orwell, Graham Greene, William Golding, William Burroughs, Saul Bellow, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Peter Matthiessen, John le Carre, V.

Just one day earlier, there were reports that President Robert Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) were close to reaching an agreement. But that fell apart Thursday. \\"We've reached a deadlock on the issue of allocating ministries, therefore we've referred the issue to the facilitator hoping that he finds creative ways of unlocking that deadlock,\\" said MDC spokesman, Nelson Chamisa. \\"We are hoping that tomorrow the process will continue to try and find a resolution to the outstanding issues.\\"  OPTIONS: - CNN had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. - Harare had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. - MDC had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. - Movement for Democratic Change had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. - Mugabe had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. - Nelson Chamisa had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. - Robert Mugabe had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. - Tsvangirai had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. - ZANU-PF party had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. - Zimbabwe had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months.","output":"MDC had suggested that ZANU-PF and MDC share that ministry, with each party having control for six months. Explanation: The most logical completion of the news story is that the opposition party, MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), had suggested to share the ministry with the ruling ZANU-PF party, giving each party control for six months. This would allow both parties to have an equal say in the management of the ministry. The other options are not as likely because: - CNN, Harare, Zimbabwe: These are not political entities involved in the talks, so they would not suggest such power-sharing deals. - Movement for Democratic Change: This is just another name for the MDC, which is the correct answer. - Mugabe, Robert Mugabe: As the President and a member of the ruling ZANU-PF party, it is less likely that he would suggest power-sharing. - Nelson Chamisa: Though he is the MDC spokesman, it is more likely that the suggestion came from the party as a whole rather than just the spokesman. - Tsvangirai: This option does not provide enough information to determine who Tsvangirai is or why they would suggest power-sharing. - ZANU-PF party: As the ruling party, it is less likely that they would suggest power-sharing with the opposition."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Her parents were Monroe \\"Monty\\" Schlessinger, a civil engineer, and Yolanda (nee Ceccovini) Schlessinger, an Italian Catholic war bride. Schlessinger has said her father was charming and her mother beautiful as a young woman. Schlessinger met and married Michael F. Rudolph, a dentist, in 1972 while she was attending Columbia University. The couple had a Unitarian ceremony. Separating from Rudolph, Schlessinger moved to Encino, California in 1975 when she obtained a job in the science department at the University of Southern California. Their divorce was finalized in 1977.  In 1975, while working in the labs at USC, she met Lewis G. Bishop, a professor of neurophysiology who was married and the father of three children. Bishop separated from his wife and began living with Schlessinger the same year. Speaking as one who went through and has personal experience with the social problems associated with such lifestyle choices, Schlessinger has vociferously proclaimed her disapproval of unwed couples \\"shacking up\\" and having children out of wedlock, helping others to not make the bad choices in the first place. According to her friend Shelly Herman, \\"Laura lived with Lew for about nine years before she was married to him.\\" \\"His divorce was final in 1979. Bishop and Schlessinger married in 1985.

Article: When early colonial settlers went to America, they took many forms of dance to _ . Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues   so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade  .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country.

Write highlights for this article: With Kinect, the new controller-free system for its Xbox 360 gaming console, Microsoft isn't just trying to revolutionize video gaming. The company wants to change how people interact with all their entertainment choices. Kinect, which goes on sale Thursday, allows players' physical movements to control action on the screen. Unlike the similar Nintendo Wii or Sony Move, there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push. Three camera sensors and four microphones help Kinect recognize who is standing in front of it. The system recognizes voice commands and reads a player's full range of movements -- not just swings of the arm -- translating them into an avatar's actions within a game. Alex Kipman, director of incubation for Kinect, said Microsoft is trying to break down technological barriers and make game interaction more natural. \\"We wanted to transform entertainment where technology understands you,\\" Kipman said during a Kinect demo in Washington. \\"It was our goal to merge really amazing tech with a really amazing experience.\\" Kipman explained that the specific components used to create Kinect have been around for years. He said the real breakthrough was in the proprietary software used to make it all work together. Cloud profiles, featuring information accessed from the Web on an as-needed basis instead of from a local hard drive, help the Kinect and Xbox 360 learn about users and what types of entertainment they might be interested in. Kinect also will help live-stream music, movies and more in real time. The much-anticipated system, first unveiled more than a year ago, is Microsoft's entry in the growing era of motion-controlled gaming pioneered by the Wii in 2006. Sony launched Move, a motion-sensing game controller for its PlayStation 3 console, in September. A Microsoft spokesperson said 30,000 North American retailers would have Kinect available Thursday, with 7,000 of those planning to open at midnight. She would not say how many units would be available on launch day. The system will launch with at least 17 games. I spent four days testing out Kinect, which should appeal to casual gamers and families more than hardcore action gamers. Here are my impressions:. Getting started. Out of the box, the Kinect sensor is 11 inches long and 3 inches high, including the motorized stand it sits on. Connecting to the Xbox is easy. For the new Xbox 360 Slim consoles, it is plug-and-play -- no additional wires. To use on the original Xbox 360 consoles, you will need a power source for the device. After some software downloads, the Kinect calibrates itself to the room automatically. It is actuated by specific gestures (waving your hand at the Kinect) or by using a specific key word for voice commands (\\"Xbox\\"). \\"It is technology that understands you,\\" Kipman said. \\"Kinect looks at 48 points on the body to figure out what it should do. It always knows who is in charge.\\" The Kinect should go at or as near eye level as possible so it can read all your movements. Also, it requires a clear space to play so nothing impedes its view of the player and nothing gets bumped or knocked over. Someone playing alone will need to be at least 6 feet back, while two players should be about eight feet from the screen. Kinect comes bundled with \\"Kinect Adventures,\\" an introductory game that teaches you how to use the device. Hovering your hand over game menu options activates those choices. Five different adventures require the player to move and react to different scenarios. \\"Rallyball\\" will get you reacting to things being thrown at you. \\"River Rush\\" and \\"Reflex Ridge\\" get you dodging and steering. \\"Space Pop\\" requires using your arms to propel you in a weightless situation. \\"20,000 Leaks\\" will stretch you out as you try to stop water from rushing in through cracked glass. All of these adventures teach players how to use their movements to control the action on the screen. The gestures will come in handy for other Kinect games. Fun with wild animals. \\"Kinectimals\\" was demonstrated at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in June, where it received high marks for its cuteness factor -- and lower marks for being, well, a little bizarre. In the game, players get to adopt a virtual pet. Among the 40 choices are a Bengal tiger, lion, panther, cheetah or leopard cub. By using voice commands and body gestures, kids can teach their cub to do tricks, feed and brush their baby animal, or just play games with it. It is definitely a game geared toward younger players. I play a lot of first-person shooter games, but I'll admit there is something neat to rubbing a tiger cub on its belly -- even if it is virtual. Full-body sports. \\"Kinect Sports\\" cranks up the action with six different games at four different skill levels. From the outdoors to the table top, different sports challenge players to really get involved with the action. Full body movements mimic those that would be needed to really play the sport. Want to score a goal in soccer? Kick the ball. Want to knock out your opponent in boxing? Throw a punch. \\"The only skill you need is life skill,\\" Kipman said. \\"If you know how to bowl, you can bowl in our game.\\" The action and movements are lifelike and will get players moving. For example, while you won't actually have a javelin in your hand, you will need to run in place up to the line and throw. The escalating skill levels make it easy for players to learn what to do and master those actions before moving up to more challenging opponents. Wheel-free racing. \\"Kinect Joy Ride\\" offers different game modes that let you race cars, do stunts or even crash into objects -- and each other. But it doesn't feel quite right because, with Kinect, there is nothing to feel. You control your car by grabbing an imaginary steering wheel. There is no accelerator or brake; the game does that for you automatically. Turning your hands left or right steers the car, but there is no tactile feedback to give you the sensation of running off the road or colliding with a light pole. This isn't a \\"Grand Turismo\\" title by any stretch of the imagination. But a racing game should have a feel to it -- this one just leaves you grasping for air. Get your body moving. Two other initial titles, \\"Your Shape: Fitness Evolved\\" and \\"Dance Central\\" are where Kinect really shines. \\"Your Shape: Fitness Evolved\\" features workouts created by Men's Health and Women's Health magazines. Players are scored on how well they match the movements of instructors who demonstrate exercises. There are Zen exercises for relaxation, or cardio boxing if you want to blow off steam in a different way. There are also personalized exercise plans to help lose weight, tone the body or get more energy. The game offers a good workout. Kinect helps correct postures and actions so users can get the most benefits out of the exercises being done. In this way, it really does work well. \\"Dance Central,\\" made by the creators of \\"Rock Band,\\" aims to get you moving to the beat, but realizes we all aren't ready to strut our stuff on the dance floor. The game combines today's dance hits performed by pop stars with moves that seem clunky at first but get more involved and intense as the difficulty ratchets up. Like \\"Guitar Hero,\\" you have to match your movements to those on the screen to get a perfect score. Beyond games. Because it has cameras, Kinect also offers the ability to connect via video with other Kinect users -- or those who use Microsoft's Live Messenger program on their PCs. It also works with the other entertainment features for the Xbox 360, such as on-demand ESPN, music from Zune.com and movies from Netflix. \\"It is all about your choice, your content when you want it,\\" Kipman said. The bottom line. I didn't get to test out the 11 other games that Microsoft says will use the new controller. But my experience with the initial six titles shows where Kinect will shine and where it will stumble. Games that feature full-body movement make best use of what Kinect can offer. Syncing up your movements with the movements on the screen is a lot easier and more natural with Kinect than with a normal controller. It's also hard to compare the Kinect to Sony's Move -- the two systems are like apples and oranges. I was pleasantly surprised and amused by Kinect's ability to record video while you are playing. While I was doing hurdles in \\"Kinect Sports'\\" track and field, my kitten decided to join the fun and began jumping as I jumped. Needless to say, the resulting video of us provided many laughs after the game. But games that would be better enhanced with a physical device in hand feel flat. On Kinect, they're just not up to the demands that players make from those types of games. You will probably not enjoy racing games and first-person shooter games as much with Kinect that you do with regular controllers. Right now, the Kinect can understand languages from the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan and Canada -- with more to roll out in the near future. Kipman said they will be constantly refining voice-recognition software to help the system recognize dialects in each language. Prices range from 399 for a 250GB Xbox 360 Kinect bundle to 299 for the 4GB bundle and 149 for the Kinect box by itself, without the console. Is it worth it? That may depend on whether you have kids -- and what kind of gamer you are.","output":"Microsoft's Kinect controller-free system for Xbox 360 aims to revolutionize gaming and entertainment interaction. Launched in 2010, Kinect eliminates the need to hold a physical controller, using three camera sensors and four microphones to recognize players' movements and voice commands. Kinect also has the ability to livestream music, movies, and more in real-time. The system's five adventure games in \\"Kinect Adventures\\" enable players to learn how to use their body movements to control the action on the screen using gestures. Kinectimals allows users to adopt a virtual pet and teach it tricks through voice commands and gestures. Kinect Sports places players' full-body movements at the center of six different games. Kinect Joy Ride doesn't require a physical steering wheel, which might not suit some gamers. The Kinect sensor is also capable of connecting to other Kinect users or Microsoft's Live Messenger program users on their PCs, and works with other Xbox 360 entertainment features. The technology offers a more natural gaming experience, especially for games that feature full-body movement. Kinect can currently understand languages from the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, and Canada, with plans to roll out more in the future. While Kinect's gesture and body movement-based system can be immersive for many games, more traditional controller-based games such as racing games and first-person shooters may not feel as satisfying on the Kinect platform. The system is particularly appealing to casual gamers, families, and those who enjoy exercise-based games like Dance Central and Your Shape: Fitness Evolved. Ultimately, whether Kinect is worth the investment depends on individual gaming preferences and the importance placed on immersive, interactive gameplay."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Research conducted by Spanish, German and Portuguese scientists has unearthed details of the extinct species of rail, which lost their ability to fly after evolving on the islands. A new study published in ‘Zootaxa’ describes the discovery of two extinct rail species in Madeira and three in the Azores. The birds “very probably disappeared following the arrival of humans and the animals that came with them, like mice, rats and cats,” explained Josep Antoni Alcover, a Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) researcher working at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies. Related: Fossil of duck-billed dinosaur found along Alabama creek By dating the birds’ bones, or other species associated with them, scientists discovered that the extinct species lived until fairly recently, especially the Azores rails. “At least one of these species survived until the 15th Century, so we are looking at a very recent extinction process,” said Alcover, who co-authored the paper. Famed British naturalist Charles Darwin visited the Azores in 1826 but his diary only mentions the existence of starlings, wagtails, finches and blackbirds. In Madeira the rail extinction may have been related to a visit by Vikings, who brought mice to the island, according to Alcover. Related: Huge titanosaur makes American Museum of Natural History debut “The bone remains of native bird species which are now appearing show that if Darwin had been able to study the fossils hidden on these islands, or if he had visited 500 years earlier, he would have found a much more singular ornithofauna, with many indigenous bird species, like that which was found on the Galápagos islands,\\" said Alcover. There are only 13 living rail species of the Rallus genus, according to the study. The extinct birds found on Madeira and the Azores \\"were smaller in size than today's continental rails, such as the water rail (Rallus aquaticus), from which they very probably originate,\\" said Alcover.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Male Urethra The male urethra passes through the prostate gland immediately inferior to the bladder before passing below the pubic symphysis (see Figure 25.3b). The length of the male urethra varies between men but averages 20 cm in length. It is divided into four regions: the preprostatic urethra, the prostatic urethra, the membranous urethra, and the spongy or penile urethra. The preprostatic urethra is very short and incorporated into the bladder wall. The prostatic urethra passes through the prostate gland. During sexual intercourse, it receives sperm via the ejaculatory ducts and secretions from the seminal vesicles. Paired Cowper’s glands (bulbourethral glands) produce and secrete mucus into the urethra to buffer urethral pH during sexual stimulation. The mucus neutralizes the usually acidic environment and lubricates the urethra, decreasing the resistance to ejaculation. The membranous urethra passes through the deep muscles of the perineum, where it is invested by the overlying urethral sphincters. The spongy urethra exits at the tip (external urethral orifice) of the penis after passing through the corpus spongiosum.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

Write an article with the title: \\"Syrian report: Israel bombs outskirts of Damascus for second time in recent days\\" Article:","output":"Title: Syrian report: Israel bombs outskirts of Damascus for second time in recent days Introduction In recent days, Syrian state media reported that Israel has carried out air strikes on the outskirts of Damascus, marking the second time that the Israeli military has been accused of targeting the capital city within a week. The Israeli government has not confirmed nor denied the military action, as per their long-standing policy of ambiguity when it comes to matters relating to its national security and military operations. Step 1: Describe the event and provide the context According to sources within Syria, the most recent air strikes were launched in the early hours of the morning, targeting locations on the outskirts of Damascus. The attacks reportedly focused on military installations and weapons storage facilities believed to be linked to Iranian-backed militias operating within the area. This comes just days after the first set of strikes were reported, which were said to have caused significant material damage, but no reported casualties. Step 2: Present the potential reasons for these actions Although Israel has not provided an official statement, it is widely known that it views Iran's presence and influence within Syria as a major security threat to its own territorial integrity and stability. Analysts suggest that the primary goal of these air strikes is to hinder the capabilities of Iranian-backed militias and degrade the supply of weapons and other military equipment being funneled into Syria. Step 3: Describe the regional implications and potential repercussions These latest strikes within Syria can be seen as an escalation of an already tense situation in the region. The Israeli government's actions risk further antagonizing Iran and its proxies in Syria, potentially leading to a more direct confrontation between the two adversaries. Some experts have expressed concern that as Iran continues to expand its footprint within Syria, the potential for a wider conflict involving other regional or global powers becomes increasingly likely. Step 4: Explain the international response and consequences The international community remains divided when it comes to Israel's military actions in Syria. While some nations, including the United States, have expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself against perceived threats, others have criticized these actions as a violation of Syrian sovereignty and international law. As tensions continue to rise, there are increasing calls for diplomatic dialogue and a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict. Conclusion The recent reports of Israeli air strikes on the outskirts of Damascus have raised alarms within the international community. As Israel continues to target Iranian-backed militia installations in Syria, the threat of further escalation looms large. All parties involved would do well to consider the consequences of their actions and explore diplomatic avenues to ensure stability and peace in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The treaty, however, required that the fortifications of these settlements be destroyed and never rebuilt, while only minimal garrisons could be maintained there, thus rendering them worthless as military bases.

Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. John Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible. Marley didn't like to learn skills that didn't belong to dogs, and he was driven out of the dog training school for causing troubles for other dogs. He didn't want to hide his emotions.

Sepultura (Portuguese pronunciation: [se.puw.'tu.ra], \\"grave\\") is a Brazilian heavy metal band from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Formed in 1984 by brothers Max and Igor Cavalera, the band was a major force in the thrash metal and groove metal genres during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their later experiments drawing influence from alternative metal, world music, nu metal, hardcore punk and industrial metal. Sepultura has had several changes in its lineup since its formation, with Max and Igor Cavalera departing in 1996 and 2006, respectively. Sepultura's current lineup consists of vocalist Derrick Green, guitarist Andreas Kisser, bassist Paulo Jr. and drummer Eloy Casagrande. Sepultura's tenth album, Dante XXI, was released on March 14, 2006. It is a concept album based on Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy. Music videos were recorded for the songs \\"Convicted in Life\\" and \\"Ostia\\". AllMusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that, \\"Overall, Dante XXI is easily one of Sepultura's strongest releases to feature Green on vocals.\\"  In a 2007 interview with Revolver magazine, Max Cavalera stated that he and Igor, both of whom having recently reconciled after a decade-long feud, would reunite with the original Sepultura lineup. There were also rumors that the reunited line up would play on the main stage at Ozzfest 2007. However, this was denied by Kisser and the reunion did not occur. Instead, Igor Cavalera left the band after the release of Dante XXI and was replaced by Brazilian drummer Jean Dolabella, leaving the band without any of its original members. After leaving Sepultura, Igor and Max formed Cavalera Conspiracy.  The band was one of the featured musical guests at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2008 on November 13. They performed a cover of \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\", and \\"We've Lost You\\" from the album A-Lex. The 9th annual Latin Grammy Awards ceremony was held at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas and aired on Univision. Sepultura also appeared in a successful ad campaign for Volkswagen motors commercial that aired nationally throughout Brazil in 2008. The spot said that \\"it's the first time you've seen Sepultura like this. And a Sedan like this one too\\". The Volkswagen TV spot shows Sepultura playing bossa nova, the opposite of its heavy metal style, to say that \\"you never saw something like this, as you never saw a car like the new Voyage\\".  Sepultura released the album A-Lex on 26 January 2009. This was the first Sepultura album to include neither of the Cavalera brothers, with bassist Paulo Jr. as the sole remaining member from the band's debut album. A-Lex is a concept album based on the book A Clockwork Orange. The album was recorded at Trama Studios in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with producer Stanley Soares. AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said, \\"Personnel changes can have a very negative effect on a band, but Sepultura have maintained their vitality all these years - and that vitality is alive and well on the superb A-Lex.\\" In the same year Andreas Kisser contributed his recipe for \\"Churrasco in Soy Sauce\\" to Hellbent for Cooking: The Heavy Metal Cookbook, stating in the recipe that he prefers his meat \\"medium-rare\\". Sepultura supported Metallica on January 30 and January 31, 2010, at Morumbi Stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The two concerts were attended by 100,000 people. The band filmed a concert DVD in 2010. Sepultura played at Kucukciftlik Park, Istanbul, on April 27, 2010. On August 8, 2010 visited the UK to play at the Hevy Music Festival near Folkestone. What happened next?","output":"After their performance at the Hevy Music Festival in 2010, Sepultura continued to make, perform, and promote their music. In the following years, the band released more albums, went on tour, and experienced further lineup changes. In June 2011, Sepultura released their twelfth studio album, Kairos. This album marked a change in the band's sound, moving away from their previous experimental direction and returning to their earlier thrash metal and hardcore roots. The album received generally positive reviews, with music critics praising the band's musicianship and ability to adapt to different styles throughout their career. In 2011, drummer Jean Dolabella left the band and was replaced by Eloy Casagrande, a talented young drummer who had previously won the Modern Drummer Undiscovered Drummer Contest in the under 18 category in 2006. Casagrande brought a fresh energy to the band, and his drumming skills were well-received by fans and critics alike. In September 2013, Sepultura released their first album with Casagrande on drums, called The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart. The album was produced by Ross Robinson, who had previously worked with the band on their influential 1996 album, Roots. The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart showcased a more aggressive sound, drawing inspiration from the band's early thrash metal days while still incorporating elements of groove and progressive metal. Sepultura celebrated their 30th anniversary in 2014 with a special tour, which saw the band perform many of their classic songs alongside newer material. Fans were treated to guest appearances and collaborations with other musicians throughout the tour. The band's fourteenth studio album, Machine Messiah, was released in January 2017. The album showcased Sepultura's continued evolution and experimentation with new sounds, including influences from progressive rock and world music. Machine Messiah received positive reviews for its innovative approach and was seen as a creative high point in their career. In 2018, Sepultura embarked on a successful world tour in support of Machine Messiah, playing in various cities across Europe, North America, South America, and Australia. The band's live performances continued to draw large crowds and praise for their energy and intensity on stage. In February 2020, Sepultura released their fifteenth studio album, Quadra. The album featured a diverse range of musical styles and received widespread acclaim from fans and critics alike. With Quadra, Sepultura demonstrated their ability to stay fresh and relevant while remaining true to their roots as a pioneering force in heavy metal music. Despite the various lineup changes and shifts in musical direction, Sepultura has maintained a loyal fan base and continues to be an influential and respected act within the heavy metal community. Their dedication to their craft and willingness to evolve as musicians has kept them at the forefront of the genre for more than three decades."},{"instruction":"Question: Facts:   - website: http://www.sheldoncomics.com , http://www.drivecomic.com/    - residence: los angeles , california    - other names: david kellett    - known for: creator of '' sheldon '' and '' drive ''    - caption: kellett in june 2011    - spouse: gloria calderon kellett -lrb- 2001-present -rrb-      - education: university diego university of kent at canterbury of notre dame university of california , san    - name: dave kellett    - image: davekellett.jpg    - occupation: cartoonist   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of dave kellett .

Article:Speaking to the BBC's Panorama programme, Lord Kinnock said: \\"Unless things change radically, and rapidly, it's very doubtful I'll see another Labour government in my lifetime.\\" Labour announces whether Mr Corbyn or Owen Smith have won the leadership contest in less than a week. Mr Corbyn insists he is \\"delighted\\" with the state of the party. Lord Kinnock, who led the fight against left-wing extremism in the 1980s, when Labour was paralysed by faction fighting, said: \\"Not just in my lifetime but stretching back to the 1930s, by any examination this is the greatest crisis that the Labour Party has faced.\\" Mr Corbyn, however, appealed to Labour MPs in an interview to \\"come together\\" after the contest. And an extraordinary olive-branch to hostile Labour MPs after the rebellion of the summer, and the failed attempt to force the leader's resignation, has emerged. Mr Corbyn's closest friend and chief lieutenant at Westminster, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, said the Labour leader and himself were willing to take lessons in leadership. \\"Tutorials\\" from former senior ministers and shadow ministers would answer accusations of incompetence, improve their performance in the House of Commons and improve relations with Labour colleagues at Westminster. \\"A bit of tutoring from some old hands?\\", I asked him. \\"Well, why not?\\" he replied. \\"Why not?\\" Panorama spent the summer with the rival pro- and anti-Corbyn factions in Labour's biggest local party, Brighton and Hove. The feuding there, and pressure from left-wing activists on the local MP, Peter Kyle, who is a critic of Mr Corbyn, mirrors the struggle taking place in many parts of the country. There are accusations in Brighton, as elsewhere, of \\"entryism\\" - infiltration of the party by members with links to groups intent on pushing Labour further to the left. The local chairman, Mark Sandell, has been named as a supporter of the far-left Alliance for Workers' Liberty, and is under investigation by the national party. He told Panorama: \\"I don't see myself as an entryist. \\"The Labour Party was founded by some really great socialists who wanted to get rid of capitalism, who wanted to change the world.\\" Mr Kyle is likely to face pressure from party members who want to sack him as a candidate at the next general election. He said: \\"I think we are standing absolutely at the edge of a cliff and it might well be that one or other of the factions, or both of us, end up going over it. \\"I really think it's that serious.\\" The leadership insists it is not seeking to purge the party of hostile MPs by seeing them deselected as candidates by left-wing local parties. But the leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, told the programme: \\"I believe some of the MPs have behaved absolutely disgracefully and they've not shown any respect whatsoever to the leader. \\"They should be held to account.\\" I asked Mr McCluskey if MPs who continued to be \\"vocal dissidents\\" if and when Mr Corbyn was re-elected would be \\"asking for it\\" when it came to the question of de-selection. He said: \\"I think they would. I think anybody who behaves in a way that is totally disrespectful and out with the culture of the Labour Party is basically asking to be held to account.\\" After warnings and speculation Labour might split if Mr Corbyn is re-elected as leader, Labour MPs critical of his leadership have told me there is no appetite in the party for a schism, or any kind of organised break-away. Some MPs who resigned from the shadow cabinet in rejection of Mr Corbyn's leadership have told me privately they are contemplating a return. Mr Corbyn is said by his close allies to be willing to see at least a share of shadow Cabinet places allocated by a ballot of MPs. But senior former shadow ministers contemplating a return are clear they will not pledge their faith in his leadership or competence to lead a Labour administration in government. Mr Corbyn insists he is \\"delighted\\" with the state of the party and the surge in its membership. He says young voters and the less well off in society could propel the party closer to power, and he denies that the idea of relying on past non-voters to deliver victory in future is \\"pie in the sky.\\" But there is no clear evidence Labour is prepared to reunite after the leadership contest. Without unity, and without reconnecting to the millions of voters the polls say have turned their back on the party, Labour seems destined to languish in the political wilderness, broken as a major force in British politics. Panorama - Labour: Is the party over? is broadcast on BBC One on Monday 19 September at 20:30 BST. Catch up on BBC iPlayer Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"This BBC Panorama article highlights the issues within the Labour Party as Lord Kinnock claims this to be the greatest crisis the party has faced since the 1930s. Jeremy Corbyn, the current leader of the party, appeals for unity among its members. However, the party is rife with faction fighting, allegations of \\"entryism\\" (infiltration of the party by members with links to groups pushing for a more left-leaning Labour), and internal struggles. The party leader and shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, expressed their willingness to take lessons in leadership from former ministers in order to improve relationships within the party and their competence. Despite talks of a potential split in the Labour Party if Corbyn is re-elected as leader, MPs have said that there is no real appetite for such a schism.

Yes: This would mean that the critics think Pfitzner is not liked because he's like the bully. (II). It is not possible to tell: This means we can't know for sure what the critics think about why Pfitzner is not liked. (III). No: This means critics don't think Pfitzner is not liked because he's like the bully. The correct answer is (II). it is not possible to tell. The premise only tells us that critics think Pfitzner is ignored because of his friendship with the bully, but it doesn't tell us if they think he's not liked for being like the bully."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film's major downfall lies in its weak plot and one-dimensional characters which hinder any deep emotional connection.  As the storyline unfolds, it becomes increasingly difficult to ignore the disjointed pacing and a string of clichés. Despite the efforts of the lead actors, their one-note performances are unable to breathe life into the stale script. The director's lack of vision is evident throughout, as a potentially engaging setting is spoiled by an uninspired approach to cinematography.  Moreover, the underwhelming dialogue and forced humor only add to the overall disappointment. To top it all, the musical score, which had the potential to uplift key scenes, only serves to enhance the movie's overall mediocrity.  In conclusion, \\"The Haphazard Journey\\" is a forgettable experience that misses out on numerous opportunities to bring its story to life. As viewers, we are left to navigate a maze of frustrating missteps and puzzling narrative choices.

Question: Newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell is forced to attend college by whom? Title: Pitch Perfect Movie plot: At a 2011 national a cappella competition, Barden University's all-female a cappella group, the Barden Bellas, perform well until Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp) vomits on stage during her solo. They are publicly humiliated, losing the competition. Four months later, newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell (Anna Kendrick) has no desire to attend college, but she is forced to do so by her father (John Benjamin Hickey), a professor at the university, with whom Beca has a strained relationship. Wishing she could instead pursue a career as a music producer in Los Angeles, Beca spends her time making mash-up mixes of songs and takes up an internship at the school radio station, where she gets to know fellow freshman Jesse Swanson (Skylar Astin). When Beca's father discovers she has not been attending classes, he comes to her with a proposition: if she joins a club and still does not want to remain at college after one year, he will allow her to leave college, and he will pay for Beca to move to Los Angeles to pursue her music career. After some persuasion from Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow) the co-leader of the Bellas along with Aubrey, she reluctantly joins the Barden Bellas. Aubrey does not initially approve of recruiting Beca, but yields nonetheless due to a desperate need for members and Beca's talent. Beca joins alongside a group of other women who do not fit the Bellas' typical mold: Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean), Stacie Conrad (Alexis Knapp), Lilly Onakuramara (Hana Mae Lee), and Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Jesse is also revealed to have joined the Bellas' all-male rival group, the Treblemakers, but his roommate Benji was rejected after being called \\"weird\\" by Bumper. The Bellas participate in the southeastern regional competition at Carolina University where, at Aubrey's insistence, they perform the same medley that helped the Bellas advance to the finals the previous year. In spite of their old set list, the group manages to place second, which sends them to the semi-finals. Unfortunately, disaster strikes for Beca...

Are you wondering why he chose Shu Qi as his muse? Shu ( or is that Qi? ) doesn't appear in this one. Instead we get a snaggletoothed Yo Hitoto, apparently a pop star in Japan -- judging by her song at the end, she's a pop star just like the girl who serves you at Rockin' Curry is \\"a actriss\\" -- and a wasted Tadanobu Asano, typically an indicator of quality, who is required to do nothing here but stand around and look like a mumbling Asian hipster and is too old to manage even that.  Hou's philosophy? Life is limbo, a big nothing, feel it and move on. I'd like to do that but Hou gives us nothing to feel in Cafe Lumiere beyond a bland photo essay of Life in Tokyo Circa 2003 and the flabbergasting observation that people are ships that pass in the night, no, make that trains that pass in the day, never connecting, each hurtling to its own destination, usually some variant of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they're lucky. Yikes. Flowers of Shanghai is one of the most rarefied, technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time. How could the same director who created the opening shot of that film, which features about twelve actors conversing at machine-gun speed for about ten straight minutes -- an impossible directorial feat -- get trapped making this laconic sub-Jarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now? Millennium Mambo may be dead weight, but at least it has two great shots, shots that hint at Hou's true calling as the film equivalent of Odilon Redon: Those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of Shu Qi floating down a blue corridor. His M.O. while making Cafe Lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from Millennium Mambo to make it more consistent. You be the judge if that sounds appealing.  Hou does not need to refine -- you cannot refine the limbo idea further than Flowers of Shanghai. He needs to expand, to bloat outwards, to release the inner expressionist and genre-revitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clichéd minimalism. It's time for him to do a live-action remake of Akira or something. This kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in long-shot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe, ghettoized and stagnant as the Hollywood action blockbuster. ( What is the connection between \\"reality\\" and people who can't talk? It seems to me that people \\"in real life\\" never stop jabbering. ) Then again, considering that 2005 alone brought big-budget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as Aeon Flux, The Island, and King Kong, it's now safe to say that even Michael Bay has surpassed Hou, and that's really sad. The good news is that, though Hou is in his 50s, it frankly feels to me as if he hasn't even begun. There are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there, such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunset-red while Hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins. But whatever fear is holding him back, however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema, Hou, your time as the darling of the Rotterdam, Venice, Toronto, Berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse double-quick. Two words for you: Atom Egoyan. Two more words, or maybe three: Tsai Ming-Liang. You are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever. Risk your shirt on a sci-fi epic, sell out, be reviled -- but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart. Let your painterly talent express itself to the full.

The writer is criticizing Hou Hsiao-Hsien's work and suggesting that he needs to expand and improve his style.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. today the american economy is an example of??","output":"Today, the American economy is primarily an example of a mixed economy, characterized by a combination of market forces, private enterprise, and regulatory policies enacted by the government to maintain a balance between economic growth, fair distribution of resources, and social welfare. This economic system has evolved and matured over time, including elements of capitalism, socialism, and state intervention, ultimately shaping the unique characteristics of the current American financial landscape. 1. Capitalism: At its core, the United States economy is rooted in capitalism, where private individuals or corporations own and operate businesses in a competitive environment. Capitalist principles, such as the freedom to choose and the profit motive, underpin the American economic system. These principles encourage innovation, entrepreneurship, and wealth creation, which, in turn, have contributed to making the U.S. one of the largest and most diverse economies in the world. 2. Regulated Market Economy: Despite the fundamental capitalist principles, the American economy has recognized the need for government intervention and regulation to protect consumers, maintain fair competition, and ensure a level playing field for all businesses. This recognition led to the establishment of numerous regulatory bodies and policies, such as the Federal Reserve System, Securities and Exchange Commission, and antitrust laws. These measures help to prevent monopolies, maintain market integrity, and preserve the stability of the financial system. 3. Social Welfare Programs: Another aspect of the American economy is the incorporation of social welfare programs, which reflect elements of socialism where the state assumes a more significant role in supporting its citizens. These programs include Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and unemployment insurance, among others. Although these systems have capitalist foundations, such as payroll tax contributions from workers and employers, these programs demonstrate the government's commitment to addressing social needs and ensuring a basic level of economic safety for its citizens. 4. Progressive Taxation: The United States utilizes a progressive taxation system, wherein the tax rate increases as an individual's income rises. This structure seeks to redistribute wealth more equitably and provide necessary government funding for public goods and services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. This tax system balances the pursuit of economic growth and individual wealth creation with the need to address income inequality and provide essential services. 5. Globalization: The American economy embraces globalization, actively participating in international trade, investment, and cooperation. Access to foreign markets, capital, and labor has provided the U.S. with economic advantages and contributed to its status as a global financial hub. However, globalization has also brought challenges, such as job displacement and the need to adapt to new technologies and evolving industries. In response, the American economy is focusing on retraining programs and educational initiatives to help its workforce remain competitive in global markets. In conclusion, the American economy is an example of a mixed economic system incorporating elements of capitalism, socialism, and government intervention. While the principles of private enterprise and competition drive economic growth, the government plays a critical role in maintaining stability, protecting consumers, and ensuring the equitable distribution of resources. This mixed system has allowed the United States to maintain a strong and diverse economy while striving to balance growth and social welfare considerations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What did the United States believe was the wrong way to govern a nation?\\" is in \\"After the formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government named the Western nations, led by the United States, as the biggest threat to its national security. Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the early 19th century, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism. As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"The United States believed that communism was the wrong way to govern a nation. This belief stemmed from multiple factors including historical, ideological, and political reasons. The ideological struggle between communism and capitalism during the Cold War era set the stage for global competition between the West, led by the United States, and the Eastern Bloc, led by the Soviet Union and its communist allies, including China. The formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and the subsequent adoption of communism as its governing ideology, placed the country in direct opposition to the United States and its Western allies. This opposition was rooted in the fundamental differences in their beliefs on governance, economic systems, and the role of individual freedom and rights. The United States favored a capitalist system with democratic governance, individual liberties, and free-market economic policies. In contrast, the Chinese government, under the leadership of the Communist Party, sought to establish a centrally planned economy with state control over resources and industries, and limited political freedoms for its citizens. The United States viewed communism as a threat to global stability, democracy, and the values of the Western world. Moreover, the Chinese leadership perceived the United States and its allies as threats to its national security due to historical humiliations, American support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ongoing ideological battle between revolutionaries and reactionaries. This perception led China to pursue a foreign policy that promoted communist revolutions in territories around its periphery. In conclusion, the United States believed that communism was the wrong way to govern a nation because of its opposition to the principles of democracy, capitalism, and individual liberties. This ideological difference was a significant factor in the global power struggle between the United States and the Communist-led nations during the Cold War era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ban Ki-moon (; Hangul: bangimun; Hanja: Pan Ji Wen ; Korean pronunciation: [pan.gi.mun]; born 13 June 1944) is a South Korean diplomat who was the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 2007 to December 2016. Before becoming Secretary-General, Ban was a career diplomat in South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and in the United Nations. He entered diplomatic service the year he graduated from university, accepting his first post in New Delhi, India. After graduating from university, Ban received the top score on Korea's foreign service exam. He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 1970 and worked his way up the career ladder during the years of the Yusin Constitution.  Ban's first overseas posting was to New Delhi, India, where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence. Ban reportedly accepted a posting to India rather than the United States, because in India he would be able to save more money to send to his family. In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea became a full UN member-state on 17 September 1991). After Park Chung-hee's 1979 assassination, Ban assumed the post of Director of the United Nations Division.  In 1980 Ban became director of the United Nations' International Organizations and Treaties Bureau, headquartered in Seoul. He has been posted twice to the South Korean embassy in Washington, D.C. Between these two assignments he served as Director-General for American Affairs in 1990-92. In 1992, he became Vice Chairman of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, following the adoption by South and North Korea of the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. From 1993 to 1994 Ban was Korea's deputy ambassador to the United States. He was promoted to the position of Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and International Organizations in 1995 and then appointed National Security Advisor to the President in 1996. Ban's lengthy career overseas has been credited with helping him avoid South Korea's unforgiving political environment.  Ban was appointed Ambassador to Austria and Slovenia in 1998, and a year later he was also elected as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO PrepCom). During the negotiations, in what Ban considers the biggest blunder of his career, he included in a public letter a positive statement about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2001, not long after the United States had decided to abandon the treaty. To avoid anger from the United States, Ban was fired by President Kim Dae-jung, who also issued a public apology for Ban's statement.  Ban was unemployed for the only time in his career and was expecting to receive an assignment to work in a remote and unimportant embassy. In 2001, during the 56th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, South Korea held the rotating presidency, and to Ban's surprise, he was selected to be the chief of staff to general assembly president Han Seung-soo. In 2003, incoming president Roh Moo-hyun selected Ban as one of his foreign policy advisors. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What did he do there?","output":"Ban Ki-moon is a man from South Korea who worked as an important helper for the United Nations, a big group of countries that work together to help people around the world. He was the eighth person to be the leader of this group from 2007 until 2016. Before that, he worked for his own country, South Korea, and also in the United Nations at different times.

Question: I have a new situation: Kelsey is bored in class, and sees a coil of wire with electricity running through it. There is a box of random pieces of iron on the teacher's desk so she goes and picks up two of them. Piece A she simply puts on her desk to use later, and Piece B she slowly passes through the coil of wire.  But I can use this background: Our knowledge of electromagnets developed from a series of observations. In 1820, Hans Oersted discovered that a current-carrying wire produced a magnetic field. Later in the same year, André-Marie Ampere discovered that a coil of wire acted like a permanent magnet and François Arago found that an iron bar could be magnetized by putting it inside of a coil of current-carrying wire. Finally, William Sturgeon found that leaving the iron bar inside the coil greatly increased the magnetic field.  What is an answer for this question: Which piece of iron is more magnetized? Answer:","output":"Piece B will be more magnetized than Piece A. Based on the historical background you provided, the key factor here is that an iron bar can be magnetized when put inside a coil of current-carrying wire.  When Kelsey slowly passes Piece B through the coil of wire with electricity running through it, it becomes exposed to the magnetic field generated by the current-carrying coil. This induces magnetization in Piece B as it aligns the magnetic domains within the iron, making it act like a magnet. On the other hand, Piece A is simply placed on the desk and not exposed to any magnetic field. Without any external force or influence of a magnetic field, Piece A remains less magnetized compared to Piece B, which has interacted with the magnetic field generated by the coil of wire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Matthew Dillon, who found love and fathered two children during more than four years on the run. An escaped prisoner fathered two children with a woman who didn't know he was a wanted man before police caught up with him. Matthew Dillon, 34, fled from Sudbury open prison in 2009, after he became 'fed-up' with his daily routine. After staging the simple escape, Dillon found love and was living with his unwitting partner - who had no idea he was on the run - and their two children when police finally tracked him down. Dillon left the open prison, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, in August 2009 as he neared the end of a 10 year eight month jail term for robbery. But police did not track him down until September, even though he was living in Perton, West Midlands, just 40 miles away. He was returned to jail on Friday after admitting one charge of escape from lawful custody at Stafford Crown Court. Imprisoning him for the rest of his sentence, plus a further six months, Recorder Adam Feest said: 'It's a great shame you chose to walk out, you would have been released fairly soon afterwards. 'You have since shown you can live a law-abiding life.' David Bennett, prosecuting, said police officers who arrested him asked Dillon why he had absconded from Sudbury and his reply was that he was 'fed up' with the prison's regime. Mr Bennett said: 'He said he wanted to hand himself in, but he had met a partner, they'd had children together and he did not want to return to prison. His partner had no idea he had absconded from prison.' HM Prison Sudbury: Matthew Dillon's partner had no idea that he had escaped from the Derbyshire jail. The court heard that Dillon was sentenced in September 2004 for conspiracy to rob and was due for release after serving two-thirds of the jail term. Mr Darron Whitehead, defending, said Dillon was only 24 when he got into serious trouble for 'a number of robberies'. He served most of his sentence at Dovegate before being moved to Sudbury ahead of his scheduled release date. Mr Whitehead added: 'He couldn't adjust to the new regime, he walked out and didn't come back.'The irony is that had he applied for parole he would probably have got it.' What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. Matthew Dillon, a 34-year-old escaped prisoner, fathered two children with a woman who was unaware that he was a wanted man. 2.

We start with the problem:  76*c - 3243 = 1661 - 2396 We want to find out what 'c' equals, right? So first, we need to simplify both sides of the equation, by subtracting 1661 from 2396. When we do that, it gives us -735. So our equation now looks like this: 76*c - 3243 = -735 Next, we want to get 'c' by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we need to get rid of the -3243 on the same side as 'c'. We can do that by adding 3243 to both sides of the equation.  When you add -735 + 3243, you get 2508. So your equation now looks like this: 76*c = 2508 Finally, to solve for 'c', we have to get rid of the 76 in front of it. That 76 is being multiplied by 'c', so to get rid of it, we divide both sides of the equation by 76.  When you divide 2508 by 76, you get approximately 33 (it's really 33.00 and continues on with a lot of zeroes, but we can just say 33 for simplicity). So, 'c' equals 33. That's your solution!

Question:   If Milo removes carbon atoms from his alkane while working in his science lab, what happens to the melting point of that alkane increases or decreases?    Text:  Alkanes with more carbon atoms have higher boiling and melting points, so some of them are solids at room temperature. The answer to this question is:","output":"If Milo removes carbon atoms from his alkane while working in his science lab, the melting point of that alkane will decrease. The connection lies in the fundamental structure of alkanes and how this ultimately affects their physical characteristics, including melting point. Alkanes are a type of hydrocarbon, which means they are composed entirely of hydrogen and carbon atoms. This structural formation follows a specific pattern, where a single carbon atom forms bonds with hydrogen atoms. With each carbon atom able to form four bonds, the molecule of an alkane grows larger as more carbon atoms are involved.  However, this growth is not isolated, but instead impacts the physical properties of the alkane, including the boiling and melting points. With each additional carbon atom, the intermolecular forces of attraction between the molecules become stronger. This happens because the addition of more carbon atoms increases the surface area of the molecules. This larger surface area then allows for stronger London dispersion forces between the molecules. These are weak, temporary forces that appear between atoms and molecules, but they contribute significantly to the overall intermolecular forces in larger molecules like alkanes. While the forces themselves are weak, collectively, they increase the stability and strength of the intermolecular forces. For this reason, alkanes with more carbon atoms require more energy, in the form of heat, to overcome these forces and change from a solid state to a liquid state (melting) or from a liquid state to a gas state (boiling). Consequently, the melting and boiling points of the alkanes increase with an increase in the number of carbon atoms.  Therefore, if Milo were to remove carbon atoms from his alkane, the opposite effect would occur. The intermolecular forces would weaken due to the reduced surface area. This would mean that less energy would be needed to overcome these forces and change the state of the substance. As such, the melting point would decrease.  So in a nutshell, if carbon atoms are removed from an alkane, the melting point of the alkane will decrease because the strength of the intermolecular forces of an alkane directly corresponds to the number of carbon atoms it contains. The lower the number of carbon atoms, the lower the melting point of the alkane."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother.

A new Fox News Poll finds Donald Trump gaining ground in the head-to-head matchup, despite improvements from Hillary Clinton on top issues. In addition, this is the first time the poll offers a four-way presidential ballot (it preceded the two-way ballot). The poll finds Clinton garners 41 percent to Trump’s 39 percent, while Libertarian Gary Johnson receives 9 percent, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein gets 4 percent. The third-party candidates take more from Clinton than Trump, as she holds a six-point lead in the two-way matchup: 48-42 percent. That’s at the edge of the poll’s margin of error. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTS She had a 10-point head-to-head advantage earlier this month (49-39 percent), in the wake of the Democratic convention and Trump’s clash with the parents of a Gold Star soldier. Clinton does well in the four-way ballot among blacks (+68 points), women (+15), and Hispanics (+19). Trump is favored by whites (+13 points), men (+13), whites without a college degree (+23), and white evangelical Christians (+55). Independents go for Trump (38 percent) over Clinton (26 percent) and Johnson (20 percent), with Stein trailing (7 percent). Party unity remains a problem for Trump, as only 74 percent of self-identified Republicans back him, while 81 percent of self-identified Democrats support Clinton. The four-way contest is also tight among just those who are “extremely” or “very” interested in the presidential race: Clinton 43 percent vs. Trump 42 percent, with Johnson at 7 percent and Stein at 3 percent. That’s driven by the fact that Democrats (79 percent) and Republicans (80 percent) are about equally likely to say they are at least “very” interested. The poll finds pros and cons for Trump. His favorable rating hit a new high-water mark (42 percent). Plus, the narrowing of Clinton’s lead in the head-to-head matchup is mostly due to Trump gaining ground rather than her losing support. Yet he’s lost his advantage on handling top issues. More voters trust Clinton than Trump on terrorism by a three-point margin (49-46 percent) and the two candidates tie on handling the economy (48 percent each). Trump led by 12 points on each of these issues as recently as May. On immigration, by a wide 77-19 percent margin, voters support setting up a system for illegal immigrants currently working in the United States to become legal residents over deporting them, and those supporting legalization back Clinton over Trump by 18 points. “Trump has an opportunity to attract more support by moving off his hardline position on immigration. Nearly half of Johnson and Stein supporters say they’d be more likely to vote for him if he did,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Republican pollster Daron Shaw. “Some of Trump’s supporters will be frustrated if he eases his promise of mass deportations, but they won’t find a more aggressive anti-immigration candidate elsewhere, so they’ll likely stick with him.” And don’t expect major movement in the race over the next few weeks, as most Clinton (87 percent) and Trump (88 percent) supporters feel certain in their choice. Plus, almost all non-Clinton supporters (87 percent) say they would “never” consider voting for her, and almost all non-Trump folks say the same about him (85 percent). The Fox News poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1,011 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide and was conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R) from August 28-30, 2016.

PUBLISHED:. 09:40 EST, 3 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 13:37 EST, 3 May 2013. Four sailors about to scatter a friend's ashes from a lovingly restored historic fishing boat were nearly killed when it was smashed to pieces on rocks. Skipper Ron Bygott, 66, and three crew members on the Courageous II were about to empty the remains of former shipmate John Fox, 45, into the sea off the coast of Cornwall when it was hit by a storm. The elegant vessel - which Mr Bygott had spent 26 years and hundreds of thousands of pounds restoring - shattered on rocks near Padstow, with pieces left strewn across a nearby beach. Wreckage: Ron Bygott and three crew members were rescued but the boat was smashed apart by the sea and eventually washed up on a beach. Destroyed: The historic fishing boat was destroyed after it smashed against rocks - while the crew prepared to scatter a friend's ashes at sea. Here parts of the vessel can be seen strewn across the beach. Mayday: The 50ft ship as it was before it was wrecked. Mr Bygott says the wheelhouse had broken in half after it struck rocks and they were forced to issue a Mayday call. Shipmates: Ron Bygott, 66, left, had gone out to see to scatter the ashes of John Fox, 45, right. The crew had been attempting to anchor the ship in the Camel estuary at the time of the disaster on April 28, but the vessel suffered a gearbox failure. The four sailors were rescued by the RNLI who say they arrived 'in the nick of time' as the men would have died just minutes later as the ship broke up. 'True friend': Mr Fox, pictured, sailed with Mr Bygott for 28 years. Looters made off with most of the wreckage left on the beach but a couple of treasured items were salvaged - including Mr Fox's urn. Mr Bygott said Mr Fox's parents had asked for his ashes to be scattered at sea after his death last December from liver complications. The married dad-of-two from Bristol said: '[Mr Fox] joined me when he was 18 years old. We were sailing together for 28 years and he was a true friend. 'We were going to scatter his ashes at the same exact place where I sprinkled my father Frederick's ashes ten years earlier but we got into trouble going into Padstow. A lifeboat turned up in about 15 minutes and it's lucky they did because my boat and the wheelhouse broke in half. 'The wheelhouse was attached to the main mast. If that had gone we would probably have gone with it. John's urn was sitting on his bunk when the ship went down. I'd also. kept my father's urn onboard all those years so that went too.' Mr Bygott said looters 'even took the figurehead - the one part I was most desperate to keep.' Members of the coastguard rescued the two urns from a rock pool. Mr. Bygott and Mr Fox had spent nearly three decades at sea together on the. 50ft vessel - which Mr Bygott had bought to restore and poured his life. savings into. The. ship, which he used for displays at boat shows - was just a hull when. Mr Bygott, a steel company boss, bought it for £12,600. Skipper: Mr Bygott, pictured, scattered his father Frederick's ashes out at sea 10 years earlier. Sad: Wreckage from Courageous II is spread across Greenway Beach in Cornwall. Looters stole most of the wreckage, but several important pieces were salvaged by the crew. Damage: The remains of the ship's wheelhouse were washed up on the beach upside down and covered in debris. Restored: More wreckage scattered on the beach. The ship had been reused and lovingly restored by Mr Bygott before the accident. More than 25 years later the colourful fishing boat - known as a 'pop pop' because of the sound of its engine - had attracted a huge following. Mr Bygott said it was so badly damaged - and that so much had been stolen - there is no hope of repairing it. He said to rebuild the stainless steel and wooden ship today would cost £1million. 'I'm absolutely distraught about the boat,' he said, 'I poured 26 years of my life into it and spent crazy money over the years. 'It was a dream, my finest achievement. It would cost you at least a million pounds to do all that work from scratch. It had a huge following and people would come from all parts to see it. I've even had someone asking me if I'll sign a piece of the wreckage.' Remains: The Courageous II had become a popular sight for boat lovers off the coast of Cornwall. Memories: There is little left of the elegant ship - seen here in port before it was wrecked. Costly: To rebuild the stainless steel and wooden fishing boat today would cost an estimated £1million. Restored: The ship, pictured in 1940, was just a hull when Mr Bygott bought it for £12,600. Mike England, of Padstow RNLI said: 'This was a very speedy rescue as the four men were in immediate danger with the boat literally breaking up under their feet. Fortunately thanks to skilful boat handling in very shallow water we were able to get them off the boat and ashore in minutes and they are all well.' The vessel was carrying 900 litres (198 gallons) of fuel and coastguards worked with the harbour authority to contain a 'small oil slick' coming from the wreck. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) has been informed about the incident. Recovered: Despite looters making off with much of the wreckage, Mr Fox's urn was salvaged.

Write an article based on this summary: Khaled Meshaal has been a key figure at the top of the leadership of the Palestinian militant group Hamas for many years, although his role and influence have been both shifting and imprecise. Article:","output":"Title: Khaled Meshaal: A Pivotal Figure in the Leadership of Hamas Khaled Meshaal embodies a unique character in the political landscape of the Palestinian militant group, Hamas. Operating in a context often marked by volatility and fragmentation, Meshaal's role and influence have been noteworthy, though often-shifting and somewhat imprecise.  Our first step in this discussion is to acknowledge Meshaal's enduring presence in the realm of Hamas's leadership sphere. For many years, Meshaal has been a central figure, conveying the group's interests and strategies at regional and international levels. This extensive timeframe within the organization's highest echelons highlights the significance of Meshaal's impact.  Despite this tenure, the nature of Meshaal's role and influence has been subjected to numerous variations. This could be attributed to the volatile environment in which Hamas operates. The organization's fraught relationship with Israel, coupled with the region's fluctuating political dynamics, could invariably lead to shifts in leadership roles. At one point, he may be a negotiator, at another, a strategist or spokesman. This fluidity is not unusual within organizations like Hamas, where changes in external dynamics often mandate internal adaptations at the leadership level. Another aspect to be considered while examining Meshaal's influence is its aforementioned impreciseness. The imprecise nature of his influence partially stems from the covert and opaque nature of the organization itself. Hamas, with its complex operational stratagems and clandestine character, often makes it challenging to ascertain the precise role and degree of influence wielded by its top leaders. Moreover, Meshaal has frequently shifted his stances in response to evolving geopolitical realities. For instance, his outlook towards engaging with the West, or his perspective on armed resistance versus diplomacy with Israel, has transformed over time. This variable approach can often lead to a somewhat unclear picture of Meshaal's true standing and the extent of his sway within Hamas. Furthermore, internal factors within Hamas, such as developing ideological rifts or power contestations, could also effect shifts in Meshaal's role and influence. As with any political entity, changes in the internal power dynamics often reflect on the roles of its key figures. In conclusion, Khaled Meshaal remains a prominent figure in the leadership of Hamas, despite the ebb and flow of his role and influence. His longevity at the top tiers of the organization is a testimony to his adaptability and strategic acumen. Nonetheless, continuous changes in the regional political landscape and internal dynamics within Hamas could mold the trajectory of Meshaal's role and influence in years to come. His journey within Hamas' leadership remains a fascinating study of resilience, adaptability, and strategic navigation within a complex and high-stakes political environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Being able to identify the different types of legal claims you might have can help you find the right attorney to offer you advice.  Issue-spotting is a fairly complex procedure that law students tackle extensively over three years of law school – so don't expect to become a master. However, basic issues can be spotted more easily, and point you in the direction of the type of attorney you need to consult. For example, if the false accusations relate to something that harms your reputation, you may have a defamation claim against your accuser. An accuser might file a false report against you to manipulate you into doing something for them, such as giving them a raise or a promotion. That situation involves elements of blackmail or fraud. Your accuser also may have a discriminatory motive. For example, they may have made a false accusation against you because they don't want to work with (or be supervised by) someone of your race or gender. This is an employment law issue. Apart from asking trusted family or friends for recommendations, you also may be able to find attorneys to consult by searching online. Your state or local bar association typically will have a searchable directory on its website.  Many bar associations have an attorney-referral service that will do much of that issue-spotting work for you. All you have to do is answer a few questions about your case, typically using an online form, to retrieve a list of attorneys who handle clients with problems similar to yours. Do a little research on the attorneys you find. Look at their professional websites to learn more about them and read client reviews. This can help you narrow down your list to a handful of attorneys who potentially could give you the best advice. Most attorneys offer a free initial consultation. You can use this to your advantage to get advice from a number of different lawyers without breaking the bank. This can be especially helpful if your case involves several legal issues and you're not sure which direction to take.  If you are seriously contemplating pursuing legal action, and want to hire an attorney for that purpose, you should interview at least three. However, if you're just looking for some general advice on what to do and haven't made up your mind yet what to do, feel free to talk to as many or as few attorneys as you feel is necessary to make an informed decision. When you schedule the consultation, ask if there's any information about your case that the attorney needs before the consultation. Some attorneys have a basic information form they expect all potential new clients to complete. Do your best to get any information about your case to the attorneys as soon as possible – at least several days before the consultations are scheduled. This gives the attorneys plenty of time to familiarize themselves with your situation. Often, attorneys treat free initial consultations as little more than an opportunity to market and sell their services. However, if you come armed with plenty of specific questions, you can get the information you need.  If you're planning on hiring an attorney, ask questions about their work and communication style. These consultations will be more focused on finding an attorney with whom you'll have a positive and productive working relationship. The consultation has a different focus if you're still trying to sort out what to do. Ask specific questions about your case as well as whether the attorney believes a lawsuit would be worth pursuing. Contrary to popular belief, most attorneys aren't sue-happy people who are itching to take any and every case that might come their way. If an attorney believes you don't have a case, they'll tell you. Likewise, if an attorney believes you have a case, but it's not a strong one or not one that would be worth the time and expense of a lawsuit, they'll tell you that too. After you've finished talking to several attorneys, you have a big decision to make regarding whether you want to file a lawsuit or take other legal action against your accuser.  You may decide that you want to sue your accuser, or your employer, or both. Get in touch with the attorney you felt was the best fit for you as soon as possible so you can determine your next steps. On the other hand, if you've decided filing a lawsuit would be too much effort and you'd rather just move on with your life, call the attorneys you met and thank them for their time. Keep in mind that attorneys are experts. If one (or several) attorneys have told you that a lawsuit is not worth pursuing, you're probably better off dropping the issue. Focus on your work and repairing any damage that has been done to your reputation as a result of the false accusation.","output":"False accusations in the workplace may involve various legal issues, and identifying the type of legal claim can help in finding the right attorney for advice. Basic issues such as defamation, blackmail, fraud, or employment discrimination can guide you towards the appropriate attorney. One can consult state or local bar associations and their attorney-referral services to find potential representation. Research and read client reviews to narrow down options, and consider free initial consultations for advice on your case. When consulting attorneys, ask about their work and communication style and their opinion on the lawsuit's validity. After speaking to several attorneys, make a decision regarding legal action against your accuser or employer. If you decide not to pursue a lawsuit, focus on repairing your reputation in the workplace."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Labyrinth: A labyrinth is a complex network of paths or passages, often designed to confuse or bewilder people. While it may be an interesting setting for a story or a puzzle, it is not a likely place to find a child's work on the wall. In a labyrinth, the focus would be on finding one's way through the maze or solving a puzzle, rather than showcasing artwork. 2. China: China, as a country, does not provide any specific context or location where a child's work would be displayed on the wall. This option is too broad and does not accurately answer the question. 3. Corner: While it is possible that a child's work could be displayed on a wall in a corner of a room, this option is not as specific and contextually appropriate as \\"classroom.\\" Corners can be found in various locations and do not necessarily relate to places where children's artwork would typically be displayed. 4. Art show: Although an art show may indeed feature a child's artwork on the wall, this option is less likely than \\"classroom\\" because art shows are less common and typically showcase selected works rather than the full breadth of a child's creations. 5. Classroom: A classroom is the most appropriate answer among the given options. In educational settings like schools and daycare centers, teachers often display students' work on the walls of their classrooms. This serves several purposes, including encouraging creativity, fostering a sense of pride and accomplishment, and showcasing the learning that takes place within the classroom. Children's artwork and projects are frequently exhibited on classroom walls as a way of celebrating their efforts and demonstrating their progress to parents, peers, and educators. Moreover, classrooms are designed to be nurturing and engaging learning environments for students. Featuring children's work on the walls creates a personalized atmosphere, giving students a sense of ownership and connection with their learning space. Teachers use this practice as an opportunity to support children's self-esteem and create a strong learning community in their classrooms. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"classroom\\" to answer the question above because classrooms are the most relevant and contextually appropriate setting for displaying a child's work on the wall. The other options – labyrinth, china, corner, and art show – do not provide the same level of contextual accuracy or likelihood as a classroom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a subject line for this message: We approach  another 'Holiday Weekend' and far too many will  forget the reason for \\"Memorial Day\\". A comrade from years ago, now living in Bangkok, sends  this address, really a prayer, that puts the day we honor our heroes in perspective. It was  delivered at the close of World War II , on an island that saw some of the fiercest fighting of that terrible war. The message is timeless. Jack Rains Houston *************************************************************************************************************************************************** 14 March 1945    U.S. Marine Corps, 5th Division, Cemetery, Iwo Jima Composed and delivered by Rabbi R. B. Gittlesohn, Chaplain, U.S.M.C. This is perhaps the grimmest, and surely the holiest, task we have faced since D-Day. Before us lie the bodies of comrades and friends. Men, who until yesterday or last week, laughed with us, trained with us, men who were on the same ships with us, and went over the sides with us as we prepared to hit the beaches on this island, men who fought with us and feared with us. Somewhere in this plot of ground there may lie the man who could have discovered the cure for cancer. Under one of these Christian Crosses, or beneath a Jewish Star of David, there may rest now a man who was destined to be a great prophet ... to find the way, perhaps, for all to live in plenty. Now they lie here silently in this sacred soil, and we gather to consecrate this earth in their memory. To speak in memory of such men as these is not easy. Of them, too, can it be said with utter truth: \\"The world will little note nor long remember what we say here. It can never forget what they did here.\\" These men have done their job well. They have paid the ghastly price of freedom. If that freedom be once again lost, as it was after the last war, the unforgivable blame will be our, not theirs. So it is we, the living, who are here to be dedicated and consecrated. We dedicate ourselves, first, to live together in peace the way they fought and are buried in this war. Here lie men who loved America because their ancestors generations ago helped in her founding, and other men who loved her with equal passion, because they themselves or their fathers escaped from oppression to her blessed shores. Here lie officer and men, Blacks and Whites, Protestants and Catholics and Jews, together. Here no man prefers another because of his faith or despises him because of his color. Any man among us, the living, who fails to understand that, will thereby betray those who lie here dead. To this, then, as our solemn, sacred duty, do we the living now dedicate ourselves: To the right of Protestants, Catholics and Jews, of White and Black men alike, to enjoy the democracy for which all of them have here paid the price. To one thing more do we consecrate ourselves in memory of those who sleep beneath these crosses and stars. This war, with all its frightful heartache and suffering, is but the beginning of our generation's struggle for democracy. When the last battle has been won, there will those at home, as there were last time, who will want us to turn our backs in selfish isolation on the rest of organized humanity, and thus to sabotage the very peace for which we fight. We promise to you who lie here: We will not do that! When the last shot has been fired, there will still be those whose eyes are turned backward, not forward, who will be satisfied with those wide extremes of poverty and wealth in which the seeds of another war can be sown. We promise you, our departed comrades: This, too, we will not permit. This war has been fought by the common man! We promise, by all that is sacred and holy, that your sons, the sons of miners and millers, the sons of farmers and workers, will inherit from your death the right to a living that is decent and secure. Thus do we memorialize those who, having ceased living with us, now live within us. Thus do we consecrate ourselves, the living, to carry on the struggle they began. Too much blood has gone into this soil for us to let it lie barren. Too much pain and heartache have fertilized the earth on which we stand. We here solemnly swear: This shall not be in vain! Out of this, and from the suffering and sorrow of those we mourn, this will come, we promise, the birth of a new freedom for the sons of men everywhere.

Answer the following question: Process:  - You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products.  suppose recycling becomes more expensive happens, how will it affect more encouragement is given to people who recycle.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process. In the given recycling process, if recycling becomes more expensive, it implies that the costs associated with various steps within the process increase. This includes areas such as the collection, transportation, sorting, cleaning, melting, and manufacturing of new aluminum products. While the increased cost doesn't modify the steps themselves, it influences the overall efficiency and feasibility of recycling aluminum. In response to the higher expenses, municipalities, private companies, or central recycling facilities may adjust their recycling programs and policies to ensure the continued viability of aluminum recycling. One way to compensate for the increased costs and ensure recycling remains a priority is to give more encouragement to people who recycle.  This encouragement could come in various forms such as financial incentives, awareness campaigns, education programs, or even policies that promote environmentally friendly behaviors. By increasing the incentives for people to recycle, it can lead to higher recycling rates and a more significant contribution towards preserving resources and reducing waste. This, in turn, helps in managing the indirect impacts of the increased overall recycling costs. In summary, the supposed perturbation – the increase in recycling costs – indirectly impacts the recycling process by influencing how recycling programs and policies are designed and implemented. Boosting encouragement and incentives for people who recycle can help maintain or even increase recycling rates despite the higher costs, resulting in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Divide both sides of the equation by 25: (25*a) / 25 = 750 / 25 Step 4: Simplify the equation: a = 30, because 750 / 25 = 30 So, the answer is a = 30."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the EP released in 2008 by the duo who returned to the band in 2007?  On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. \\"For a year now\\", Corgan wrote, \\"I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\\". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.In April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \\"didn't want to be a part of\\" the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, \\"Tarantula\\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \\"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\\". Corgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo, releasing the four-song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles \\"Superchrist\\" and \\"G.L.O.W.\\" later that year.

Summarize this article: You'll need to lay out 5 reeds parallel to one another, with about 3/8ths of a space between them.  Weave a sixth reed perpendicularly through the other 5. Bring the sixth reed over the first reed, under the second, over the third, under the fourth and over the fifth reed. Weave 4 more reeds in this manner, making sure that they are parallel to the sixth reed. Ensure that the squares formed by the base weaving are no bigger than 3/8 inch (.9 cm). Bend the reeds that stick out from the square base into an upwards position. These bent reeds are called spokes. Bending them will make it easier to weave and these spokes will act as the supports for the basket. Split one end of either the third or eighth spoke, starting where it comes out from under the last spoke to cross it. You will now have eleven spokes. You'll be putting the weaver into the split. . Put the tapered end (the smaller end) of a weaver reed into the split spoke and hold it in place with a clothespin. Keep the weaver reed near the base of the basket and weave, by going over one spoke and under the next.  If you're going for a square shape, hold the base corners together with clothespins. This will help maintain the shape of the base. Continue to attach and weave new reeds through the spokes for 3 or 4 rows, depending on the desired height of the basket. Each new reed should be stacked above the reed woven before it. Do your best to make the weave snug and tight, but not too tight or you can screw up the base of the basket. You, also, want to make sure that the weave isn't too loose. This means closing up those square holes that are still in the base. Starting in the left corner of your basket, take the corner spoke and tug it gently. Tug more firmly on the second spoke. You want to tug quite firmly on the middle spoke because this will create an arch in the bottom of the basket. Move to the 4th spoke and tug gently again. Straighten your spokes and repeat on all 4 sides of the basket, until the holes in the base are closed. Keep attaching and weaving new reeds through the spokes. Make sure that you don't pull too hard on the corners, because that will make your spokes bend inward and you'll lose your basket's shape.  You also don't want your corners to be too loose, which can happen if you aren't keeping your spokes upright and parallel while you weave. Stop weaving once you've reached your desired height. Push or pull the woven rows down towards the base as you weave. Ensure that there is no space between the base and the rows. Start pressing or pulling from the base and move up to the newer reeds as you go. A properly packed basket should have a nicely arched base, straight, parallel spokes, properly spaced corners, and tight weaver rows. Stop weaving your last reed after you have woven 4 spokes past the split spoke. Taper the reed with scissors, moving from the fourth spoke to the end of the reed. Weave until all of the final reed has been woven into the spokes. Cut the spokes with scissors. The spokes should be 1/2 to 2 inches (1.3 to 5 cm) higher than the last woven reed. Fold the spokes towards the inside of the basket over the top row of reeds. Insert the end of each spoke into the third row from the top. Ensure that each spoke lies flat against the inside of the basket. You'll wrap a reed around the top row of the basket and pin it to the basket with a clothespin. Now, anchor the new reed by weaving its bottom end into the top few rows inside the basket. This reed is called the lacer.  Bring the lacer up and over the reed pinned to the basket and insert it through the front of the basket into the woven rows. Now pull the lacer inside the basket. Continue wrapping the lacer around the pinned reed, circling the circumference of the basket. Glue the end of the lacer inside the basket.","output":"This article provides a step-by-step process on how to create a woven basket. The main steps can be summarized as follows: 1. Base formation: Lay out five reeds parallel to each other with about 3/8-inch space between them. Weave a sixth reed perpendicularly through the other five, followed by four more reeds parallel to the sixth reed, resulting in a square base. 2. Creating spokes: Bend the reeds protruding from the square base upwards to form spokes, which will act as support for the basket. 3. Adding the weaver: Split one end of either the third or eighth spoke to insert the tapered end of a weaver reed. Hold it in place with a clothespin. Weave the reeder by going over one spoke and under the next to maintain a square shape. 4. Weaving additional rows: Add and weave new reeds through the spokes for 3-4 rows depending on the desired height. Stack each new reed above the previous one and ensure the weave is snug and tight. 5. Closing the base holes: Gently tug the corner spokes, firmly tug on the middle spoke, and gently tug the remaining spokes. Repeat on all four sides to close the holes in the base. 6. Maintaining shape: While continuing to attach and weave new reeds, avoid pulling too hard on the corners or keeping spokes too loose, to maintain the proper shape. 7. Stopping at desired height: Once you've reached the desired height, push or pull the woven rows down towards the base to eliminate spaces between the base and rows. 8. Finishing the last reed: Stop weaving after going 4 spokes past the split spoke. Taper the reed with scissors and weave it into the spokes. 9. Trimming and folding spokes: Cut spokes to 1/2 to 2 inches higher than the last woven reed, fold them towards the inside of the basket, and insert the end of each spoke into the third row from the top. 10. Adding the lacer: Wrap a reed around the top row of the basket, pin it with a clothespin, and weave its bottom end into the top rows inside the basket.

She's famous for her relaxed approach to royal walkabouts but even the Duchess of Cornwall couldn't hide her surprise when offered a perch on a well-wisher's knee during a visit. After bursting into fits of laughter, Camilla delicately took up Anthony Laing's offer as she took her place at the centre of a group photo with staff at the Shortbread House of Edinburgh. Mr Laing, the business' managing director, looked thrilled by his usually close brush with royalty, as did the chuckling staff members. New throne: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, perches on the knee of Anthony Laing (left) during a visit. Camilla was visiting the bakery as part of the annual royal tour of Scotland which kicked off yesterday with a visit to a jazz festival. But it was the bakery trip that proved the highlight of the week so far, with Camilla cheerfully donning a white coat and hat over her pretty navy and white patterned dress for the tour. Later, she tried on some clothes of an entirely different sort as she visited the Edinburgh International Fashion Festival sporting her favourite taupe coat and white pleated skirt. There, she was treated to a catwalk show and inspected pieces by some of Scotland's hottest young design talent before being presented with a tiny teddy for her grandson Prince George. Taking her seat: Camilla giggles as Mr Laing makes the offer before sitting down on his knee. Eye-opening: Camilla gets an eyeful of a risque display at the Edinburgh International Fashion Festival. Enjoying the show: Camilla sat front row with Anna Fremantle, the brains behind the event, during the show. Is that for George? The Duchess of Cornwall was given a teddybear for her grandson at the fashion festival. Stylish: The Duchess wore a white pleated skirt and taupe jacket for her visit to the Edinburgh Fashion Festival. She was also confronted with a set of risqué mannequins but appeared none the worse for the experience. Charles, however, was nowhere to be seen and instead of joining the Duchess at the bakery, travelled to the Glendelvine Estate in Perthshire. where he found himself face-to-face with a huge fluffy red squirrel. Happily. for the environmentalist prince, this one was a toy gifted to him as he. was brought up to speed with efforts to save the red squirrel, an. endangered native species. Once. common to the whole of the UK, the red squirrel is threatened by the. increasing numbers of grey squirrels, with the alien species forcing the. native reds north. Keepers at the Glendelvine Estate have hit upon a novel solution to the problem - trapping any greys spotted on the land. Tasty: Camilla listened intently as she was told about shortbread before being handed some to try. Enjoying the tour: Despite being forced to don a white cover-all and hat, Camilla enjoyed her visit to the bakery. Lovely to meet you: Camilla is introduced to bakery staff at the Shortbread House of Edinburgh. Present for George? A delighted Prince Charles was handed a giant red squirrel toy for Prince George. On the way to London: The toy, presented by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, was placed in the boot. Meeting: Prince Charles meets Black Watch veteran Dr Tom Renouf at Balhousie Castle in Perth. The. programme, which has been underway since 2009, sees David Fraser, the. estate's gamekeeper, trap up to 63 grey squirrels a year - with. dramatically beneficial effects for the reds. Later, the Prince of Wales attended a. reception for the Scottish Wildlife Trust's 50th anniversary at Murthly. Castle, near Perth before carrying on to Balhousie Castle for a tour of the Black Watch Regimental Museum, which reopened last year after a £3.5 million redevelopment. Charles is Royal Colonel of the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, as well as patron of the Black Watch Royal Highland Regiment Association and of the Black Watch Heritage Appeal. The. visits to the Shortbread House and Glendelvine are part of a week of. Scottish engagements for the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall,. who are known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay north of the border.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Motion City Soundtrack was formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1997 by singer-songwriter Justin Pierre and guitarist Joshua Cain. Previously, the duo had separately played in a number of bands. Cain was in a group named the Saddest Girl Story, and recruited Pierre to join as a singer. He was subsequently in a band called Boxcar, and following its dissolution, he and Pierre founded Motion City Soundtrack together. The band's name was created by Cain's brother, Brian. Their early days were difficult, as they found it hard to break out of their local scene. When they could get weeks off from their jobs, they would tour. According to Cain, the members of the band soon realized that there \\"wasn't really anywhere to play [shows] in Minneapolis\\", and that they would have to \\"tour all the time\\" to rise in popularity. In its early years, the group went through several lineup changes. Through these, Cain and Pierre would often have to take over keyboard duties during shows. The group's first release was a 7\\" single, \\"Promenade / Carolina\\", released in 1999. Their next two releases, both extended plays--Kids for America and Back to the Beat--were released the following year.  Over the course of the early 2000s, the band continued to tour and shuffle through members. In late 2001, while touring in Milton, Pennsylvania with the band Submerge, they convinced two of its members--bassist Matthew Taylor and drummer Tony Thaxton--to join Motion City. Thaxton initially took about a year to convince to join the band. Jesse Johnson, a friend and co-worker of Cain's, joined the band as keyboardist just three weeks before the band recorded their first album. Johnson had never played the keyboard before but Cain taught him the parts that had already been written. After their first attempt at self-recording an album failed, the band culled together 6,000 to record with producer Ed Rose, best known for his work with the Get Up Kids. They recorded much of their debut album, I Am the Movie, in ten days. Initial copies were hand-packaged inside floppy disks, which were sold out of the back of their tour van for a year.  The band began receiving offers from various record labels, including Universal, Triple Crown Records, and Drive-Thru Records, and they performed at industry showcases. Meanwhile, Brett Gurewitz, founder of Epitaph Records, learned of the band from members of the group Matchbook Romance. He attended four of their shows in Los Angeles that Pierre later regarded as among his worst, as his voice was poor from constant touring. While they were interested in Universal, they chose to sign to Epitaph as they felt the contract was less restrictive and more honest. Eli Janney from Girls Against Boys helped the band secure management and a lawyer. Motion City became part of a slew of Epitaph signings, including Matchbook Romance, Scatter the Ashes and From First to Last, amid concerns the Southern California label had strayed too far from its roots, and seemed \\"a little too emo.\\" Answer this question \\"Were they in other bands?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, they were in other bands.

The tires at that point experienced What's the answer? Pick your answer from: (i). less friction (ii). more friction (iii). free falling (iv). zero friction","output":"The correct answer is (ii). more friction. To understand this answer, we need to look at the dynamics of vehicle tires and the forces at play while turning a corner. When a vehicle rounds a corner, the tires must generate enough friction with the road surface to prevent slipping. This friction, also known as the traction force, helps the vehicle maintain its velocity and follow the desired path around the corner. However, when the vehicle slips, it suggests that either the tires fail to generate enough friction, or the available friction has been exceeded. This could be due to factors such as excessive speed, wet or icy road conditions, or worn/bald tires. When the tires slip, they experience a sudden and typically brief increase in friction as they try to regain optimal contact with the road surface. This momentary increase causes the tire to squeal. The squealing sound is generated by the tire's interaction with the rough road surface, which results in the rapid excitation of the tire's structural components. When there is an excessive slipping or loss of traction, the friction between the tire and the road surface increases to oppose the skidding motion. During the skidding event, tire friction is still present to some extent but may not be sufficient to maintain control over the vehicle's trajectory. This period of 'relative loss' of traction, as compared to the conditions before the skidding began, is responsible for the generation of the squealing sound that is heard during the incident. To summarize, when a vehicle rounds a corner and slips, squealing, the tires at that point experienced an increase in friction (answer ii) as they struggle to regain optimal contact with the road surface and maintain control of the vehicle. Factors like excessive speed, inadequate tire treads, or unfavorable road conditions can contribute to this slip and the consequent increase in friction."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: I can use this background: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation.  Now, I have a new situation: David was visiting Japan. First, he went to Fukushima where the recent nuclear plant disaster happened. He found the city still had very high radiation. Then he visited Hiroshima. He found that Hiroshima had some low radiation. Finally, he visited the capital city Tokyo. He found that Tokyo did not have any radiation.  Answer this question please: In which city a Geiger counter would click slower, Fukushima or Hiroshima? Answer:","output":"A Geiger counter would click slower in Hiroshima. Step 1: Understand the background information The background information states that a Geiger counter clicks faster when it detects higher levels of radiation. Step 2: Analyze the situation David visited three cities in Japan: Fukushima, Hiroshima, and Tokyo. He found that Fukushima has very high radiation, Hiroshima has low radiation, and Tokyo has no radiation. Step 3: Compare the radiation levels of Fukushima and Hiroshima The question asks in which city a Geiger counter would click slower, meaning where the radiation level is lower. Since Fukushima has very high radiation and Hiroshima has low radiation, Hiroshima is the city with the lower radiation level. Conclusion: A Geiger counter would click slower in Hiroshima because it has lower radiation levels than Fukushima."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: It can be a real wreath or an artificial wreath; the size of the wreath does not matter either. You can find real wreaths in grocery stores and Christmas tree farms, while artificial ones are found in craft stores. Keep in mind that most stores do not sell these wreaths year-round. You are more likely to find them around the holiday season, typically November and December. Some wreaths come pre-lit or flocked with fake snow. You can use these if they fit your overall vision. Like artificial Christmas trees, artificial wreaths come compressed. Choose a point on the wreath to start at, then gently pull the branches away. Work your way around the wreath until you are back where you started. If the branches have smaller twigs, be sure to pull them away too.  You don't have to pull the branches all the way out--just enough to give the wreath a fuller appearance. Skip this step if you have a real wreath. The branches are already fluffed out. Purchase a can of fake snow spray from the craft store or Christmas tree farm. Follow the directions on the can to mist a light coating of fake snow onto your wreath. The product is similar to spray paint, except that it will coat the wreath with textured, white flocking instead. Let the product dry completely before moving on.  You can use as much or as little flocking as you want. Keep in mind that the more you use, the harder it will be to secure the items to the wreath. How long the flocking takes to dry depends on the brand that you are using. Check the can for complete drying times, but expect to wait 8 to 24 hours. Buy one to two strands of battery-operated lights for the wreath. Wrap the lights around the wreath, then secure the battery pack to the back of it. Use green floral wire if it is a real wreath. If it is an artificial wreath, simply bend one or two twigs around the battery pack to hold it in place.  Keep the lights proportionate to the wreath. Use standard-sized Christmas tree bulbs for large wreaths, and tiny \\"fairy lights\\" for small wreaths. A single strand of lights should be enough for a small wreath. A large wreath may require 2 strands. It will also help you figure out what sorts of items to put on your wreath. Listed below are some examples of popular Christmas themes:  Classic: candy canes, Santa Clause, Frosty, Rudolf, etc. Royal: solid backgrounds with gold flourishes and scrolls. Rustic cabin: gingham, plaid, reindeer silhouettes, snow-covered pines, etc. Winter Wonderland: snow, snow-covered pines, snowflakes, and icicles. Vintage: Victorian Christmas cards, angels, carolers, A Christmas Carol, etc. Red and green is a popular Christmas color scheme, but you can also try a less used combination, such as blue and silver. Keep in mind that not all color schemes work with all themes. For example, red and burlap will work much better for a rustic theme than red and gold. Here are some ideas to get you started:  Classic: red and green with white accents. Royal: gold and dark red or dark green. Rustic cabin: red and white/beige/burlap. Winter Wonderland: blue and white with silver or iridescent accents. Vintage: red and green with gold accents. Round, glass Christmas ornaments are a great, classical option, but you can also use shaped ornaments made from different materials, such as plastic snowflakes and wooden nutcrackers. For a more natural-looking wreath, try Christmas picks instead.  Match the items to the size of your wreath. The smaller the wreath is, the smaller the items should be. How many items you get depends on the size of your wreath and design. In general, the larger the wreath, the more items you'll have to buy. Christmas picks are small floral pieces, such as sprigs of holly or pine. They are often accented with berries and Christmas ornaments, and you can find them in craft stores. If your design includes a garland, it would be a good idea to wrap it around your wreath now. Secure the ends of the garland to the back of the wreath with pieces of green floral wire. Tuck some portions of the garland under the branches. This will give you are more organic appearance. If your design has any bows, lay them down first. Position the ornaments next, starting with the largest ones first. Do not glue, wire, or secure the items to the wreath; play around with the arrangement until you are happy.  Consider decorating just a corner of the wreath. Use larger items in the center of the design, and smaller items on the edges. Bunch items together in groups of three. If you want to work in groups of two, choose items of different sizes. Work in a clockwise direction, starting with the largest items first, then filling in the gaps with smaller ones. How you secure the items to your wreath depends on the item. For example:  Tie natural items to your wreath with pieces of green floral wire.  Hang ornaments from the branches like you would on a Christmas tree. Tuck long branches into the wreath, then bend the stem behind the wreath to secure it.   Hot glue items that cannot be tied or that can fall off, such as cinnamon sticks.","output":"Wreaths can be real or fake, and you can find them in different places at certain times of the year like November and December. Wreaths can be decorated in many ways, with lights, snow, and pretty things like candy canes or snowflakes. When you decorate your wreath, make sure everything looks nice and fits well together.

Context: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington. Question: Where are the killer whales most studied? Options: - not enough information - on the boat in Steveston - South of Vancouver - San Juan Islands Answer:","output":"San Juan Islands"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: who won the afl grand final in 2000?","output":"The 2000 AFL Grand Final was won by the Essendon Football Club. Essendon, often referred to as the \\"Bombers,\\" competed against the Melbourne Football Club, commonly known as the \\"Demons,\\" in this match. The grand final took place on September 2, 2000, at the renowned Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Essendon dominated the game from the very beginning and went on to secure a resounding victory over the Demons with a final score of 19.21 (135) to 11.9 (75). This 60-point margin was Essendon's most significant AFL Grand Final win since 1985. The 2000 season was an exceptional year for the Bombers, as they had an impressive win-loss record of 21-1 during the home-and-away season. That year, they also claimed the McClelland Trophy, which is awarded to the team that finishes on top of the ladder at the end of the regular season. James Hird, the captain of Essendon, was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for his outstanding performance in the grand final. He was instrumental in the Bombers' triumph, registering 29 disposals and two goals during the game. The victory marked Essendon's 16th VFL/AFL Premiership and solidified their position as one of the most successful clubs in Australian Football League history. Kevin Sheedy, the coach of Essendon at the time, played a vital role in the team's success. His innovative tactics and strong leadership contributed to the Bombers' devastating form throughout the 2000 season, ultimately culminating in their grand final victory. The win also signified Sheedy's fourth premiership as a coach, etching his name in the AFL record books as one of the game's most successful and respected figures. In summary, the 2000 AFL Grand Final was won by the Essendon Football Club as they triumphed over Melbourne in an authoritative display. The victory was a testament to Essendon's exceptional form during that season and the outstanding contributions from captain James Hird and coach Kevin Sheedy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sexual identity and sexual behavior are closely related to sexual orientation, but they are distinguished, with sexual identity referring to an individual's conception of themselves, behavior referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual, and orientation referring to \\"fantasies, attachments and longings.\\" Individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors. People who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity are sometimes referred to as 'closeted'. The term may, however, reflect a certain cultural context and particular stage of transition in societies which are gradually dealing with integrating sexual minorities. In studies related to sexual orientation, when dealing with the degree to which a person's sexual attractions, behaviors and identity match, scientists usually use the terms concordance or discordance. Thus, a woman who is attracted to other women, but calls herself heterosexual and only has sexual relations with men, can be said to experience discordance between her sexual orientation (homosexual or lesbian) and her sexual identity and behaviors (heterosexual). Which word is used when somebodys sexual orientation, behaviors, and idenity match?","output":"The term used when someone's sexual orientation, behaviors, and identity match is \\"concordance.\\" This indicates that the person's attractions, self-identified sexual orientation, and actual sexual behaviors are all aligned."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the real name of the person who met face-to-face with a man-eating grizzly bear when he was younger?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Chicagoan Chester \\"Chet\\" Ripley, his wife, Connie, and their two sons, Buckley \\"Buck\\" and Ben, are on vacation at a lake resort in Pechoggin, Wisconsin during the summer. All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, it emerges that Roman has made a bad investment and is broke. He has not told Kate and was planning to hit up Chet for the cash. Later, during a thunderstorm, the twins wander off and fall into a mine shaft. Chet and Roman find them, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny mine shaft. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman summons up all his courage, while Chet goes in search of a rope to pull them out. Upon realizing that the mine is stocked with old dynamite, Roman takes his daughters and climbs out of the shaft on his own.

The first spectators, many carrying chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a good spot. The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until the start of the concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.The stage backdrop depicted an urban rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline.  At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!\\" The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, looked at each other and shook hands, and began the concert with their 1968 hit \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". After the second song, \\"Homeward Bound\\", Simon delivered a short speech which began, \\"Well, it's great to do a neighborhood concert.\\" He then thanked the police, the fire department, the park administration and finally Ed Koch. The audience booed at the mention of Koch but applauded as Simon continued. Simon & Garfunkel played twenty-one songs in total: ten by the duo, eight by Simon, one by Garfunkel, a cover of  The Everly Brothers' \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\", and the medley version of \\"Maybellene\\". Each performer sang three songs alone, including one new song apiece. Garfunkel sang the Simon & Garfunkel classic \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"April Come She Will\\", and \\"A Heart in New York\\", a song written by Gallagher and Lyle that appeared on his album Scissors Cut, which had been released the previous month.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25.

Reporters mob Asiana Airlines president arriving in San Francisco About 50 reporters had gathered at the airport's international arrivals area for the flight carrying Yoon: Asiana Airlines Flight 214 -- the same number as Saturday's ill-fated flight. Yoon is expected to tour the crash site and meet with officials and possibly passengers. When Yoon finally stepped out and bypassed a makeshift microphone stand, the crowd erupted into chaos. A mob of reporters ran after him, flashing cameras and thrusting microphones in his face. At least two police officers standing nearby intervened, yelling for the crowd to move back. \\"Somebody get me a baton!\\" one shouted. After only a brief moment in the frenzy, Yoon was ushered back through the arrival door, a handful of reporters still trailing behind him. Another brief scuffle broke out before he was escorted back through the way he came in. At a briefing in Seoul on Tuesday, Asiana Airlines said experienced pilots were at the controls when the Boeing 777 crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport last week, killing two and injuring scores of others. Lee Kang-kook, the captain who was in training on the aircraft, had previously flown in to San Francisco International 29 times as a co-pilot on Boeing 747s, Yoon told reporters, and the co-pilot on the flight, Lee Jung-min, had flown into the airport 33 times. “They each had 33 and 29 times of operational experience,” Yoon said before boarding the flight to San Francisco, calling the men “excellent pilots.” \\"I can tell you that they were sufficiently qualified pilots.\\" The investigation into Saturday’s crash is zeroing in on what went wrong in the moments leading up to the plane’s approach onto Runway 28L, when the aircraft was flying too low and too slow. Aviation safety experts questioned why the crew did not recognize the problem and take action before the flight clipped a sea wall then rammed into the runway. It was only 1.5 seconds before impact that the plane attempted to abort the landing, by which time it was too late. Lee Kang-kook had only 43 hours of experience on the 777. Lee Jung-min was his “training captain,” but he had only been certified as a training supervisor June 15, less than a month before the crash, Asiana representatives said. Yoon said he had personally apologized to the families of the two Chinese girls who were killed in the crash. He is scheduled to view the crash site Tuesday afternoon after arriving in San Francisco, and possibly meet with survivors and their families in the coming days. Yoon said he did not expect to meet with the pilots because they are out of reach until the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation is concluded.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Set a specific bedtime for yourself that is eight hours before your alarm normally goes off. Continue this bedtime ritual for several weeks (including weekends). Over time you will start getting a good understanding of your body’s natural sleep requirements.  Keep a notebook next to the bed where you can log each day when you fell asleep, how easily you fell asleep, whether you woke up before your alarm went off or not - notate any and all information about your sleep/wake cycle. After establishing your natural sleep patterns, you can start training your body to wake up earlier, since you'll know how much sleep your body naturally wants. Our bodies make and secrete into our bloodstream a hormone called melatonin, which stimulates sleep and controls sleep/wake cycles. Melatonin supplements are available to buy over the counter at almost all pharmacies and grocery stores (look in the vitamins and supplements section). To help reset your body’s clock, try taking a low dose of melatonin (0.5 to 1.0 milligrams) approximately five hours before bedtime for several days in a row.  After a few days of this, your body will reset its internal clock, allowing you to get to sleep earlier and also wake up earlier the next day. Melatonin supplements are generally considered safe for everyone, but always consult your physician before adding a new supplement to your daily intake, especially if you have any serious health conditions or take other medications. Instead of making a drastic change overnight, this method will ease you into being a morning person. Determine what your new wake up time will be and set that as your goal. Keep your current wake up time, and start waking up earlier by one minute each day. Your body’s internal clock will begin to naturally reset itself. For some, this method might seem too slow. However, keep in mind that the least jarring and most successful sleep schedule changes happen slowly and gradually. If you want waking up earlier to become habitual for you, maintaining the same schedule on the weekend that you do during the week is a must! The continued repetition of a consistent sleep schedule will ensure that the habit of waking up earlier is established within your body’s internal clock. Studies show that having a specific sleep schedule during the week and sleeping later on the weekend to recover can actually cause a person to feel tired and jet-lagged once the new week begins. This throws off all of the progress you made during the week! Summary:","output":"To help your body learn when to sleep and wake up, make a bedtime eight hours before your alarm and stick to it for weeks (even weekends). Write down how you sleep each night in a notebook. Knowing how much sleep your body needs, you can slowly train to wake up earlier. Take a small melatonin supplement (a sleep hormone) five hours before bedtime for a few days to help reset your body's clock. It's important to ask your doctor before taking any new supplements. Wake up one minute earlier each day to gently change your sleep schedule and keep it the same on weekends.

Article:      Members of the Mashco Piro tribe observe a group of travelers from across the Alto Madre de Dios river in the Manu National Park in the Amazon basin of southeastern Peru, as photographed through a bird scope in this file picture from Oct. 21, 2011. (REUTERS/Jean-Paul Van Belle)      For the first time, anthropologists working for the Peruvian government will attempt to make contact with members of a remote tribe living in the Amazon jungle. The move follows growing concerns about the behavior of the Mascho Piro people, which has included attacks and raids on neighboring communities.      South America, and in particular the vast Amazon region, is home to some of the world's last remaining \\"uncontacted\\" tribes -- indigenous communities that, for whatever reason, have managed to exist almost entirely outside the purview of the nation-states in which they technically live. Experts fear a whole slew of risks that may follow should these tribes come into full contact with the outside world, from exploitation by rapacious mining and logging companies to the devastating transfer of pathogens to which they have no immunity.      In recent decades, some governments have taken a protective stance, working to shield these communities from outside contact mostly because of the health risks involved. After all, some estimates suggest contact with outside diseases killed up to 100 million indigenous people following the European arrival in the Americas.      Peru bars contact with about a dozen \\"uncontacted\\" Amazonian tribes living within its borders, a positive departure from an earlier time when the government would not even recognize their existence. Brazil has its own federal agency responsible for indigenous peoples. In 2011, it allowed cameras to document unprecedented aerial footage of its observations over the jungle.      Rights groups and activists have long campaigned in the defense and protection of indigenous lands in the Amazon, fighting against the predatory interests of oil companies as well as a tragic history of violence that saw tribal peoples victim to generations of settlers, loggers, and traffickers.      Survival International, which campaigns for the rights of tribal and indigenous communities worldwide, says that Peru and Brazil are not doing enough to safeguard these \\"uncontacted\\" tribes. Last year, the organization warned against tourists carrying out \\"human safaris\\" near Mascho Piro land.      Jeffrey Kluger, Time magazine's science editor, recently recounted a study in Science magazine that detailed the challenges and ethics of how to treat \\"uncontacted\\" tribes. This included this chilling anecdote of how vulnerable some of these tribes are to outside contact:      Goods that go from body to body should be entirely off-limits. [Journalist Andrew] Lawler spoke to Peruvian villager Marcel Pinedo Cecilio, 69, who was born in the forest but later emerged. Cecilio recalls his first contact with an outsider—thought to have been an ethnographer and photographer—who left the villagers with a gift of a fishbone necklace. Shortly thereafter, much of the tribe came down with a sore throat and fever and 200 of them died. In the 1980s, up to 400 Peruvian villagers died from passing contact with crews of Shell oil company workers.      As a result, the current investigation into the Mashco Piro tribe in Peru has earned its concerned critics.      \\"Authorities should restrict boat transit and keep people from approaching,\\" Klaus Quicque, president of FENAMAD, a regional indigenous federation in Peru, told Reuters.      The urgency of the contact was spurred by an incident in May, when some members of the tribe attacked another local community, killing a young man with an arrow. The officials enlisted to make contact will engage the tribe through interpreters who speak the Yine language, which they believe shares similarities to the tongue spoken by the Mashco Piro people.      In 2013, the Mashco Piro earned global attention when dozens of members of the tribe appeared on the banks of Amazonian tributary near a small Yine town, and demanded rope, machetes and bananas. FENAMAD rangers stationed there dissuaded them from crossing the river, but the standoff was tense, with some of the men from the tribe carrying bows and long wooden lances.      Nearby villagers, Christian missionaries and the occasional tourist have all reported meeting Mashco Piro people.      \\"We can no longer pretend they aren't trying to make some sort of contact,\\" Luis Felipe Torres, a Peruvian official working on state tribal affairs, told Reuters. \\"They have a right to that, too.\\"      Experts say the phrase \\"uncontacted\\" is something of a misnomer, given that all communities on the planet are aware of their neighbors and have some sense of the wider world outside their homes.      \\"People have this romanticized view that isolated tribes have chosen to keep away from the modern, evil world,\\" said Kim Hill, an anthropologist at Arizona State University, in an interview with the BBC last year. But that's rarely the case.      \\"There is no such thing as a group that remains in isolation because they think it’s cool to not have contact with anyone else on the planet,\\" said Hill.      Writing in Science magazine last month, Hill and colleague Robert Walker reiterated this point, suggesting that many of South America's \\"uncontacted\\" communities had \\"chosen isolation out of fear of being killed or enslaved\\" and that, like most human beings living in constrained circumstances, \\"they also wanted outside goods and innovations and positive social interactions with neighbors.\\"      The academics suggested the best path forward is a policy of \\"controlled contact\\" with these communities, carefully managed to avoid the spread of disease, but also enable the building of trust and providing aid and medical help if needed. The current Peruvian mission may serve a test case for this sort of endeavor. ||||| The Peruvian government plans to make its first contact with the Mashco Piro, an isolated tribe that live in the Amazon rainforest.      Reaching out to \\"uncontacted\\" tribes is controversial, particularly because isolated tribes lack immunity to common diseases, which can quickly turn deadly. But officials say they need to contact the Mashco Piro because the group has recently been emerging from the forest, and have had contact with villagers, tourists and missionaries.      In September 2014, for example, the advocacy group Survival International reported that Adventist missionaries had left food and clothes for the tribe near the border of Manu National Park. Gestures like this have spread diseases to uncontacted people in the past, causing epidemics.      Tour companies also advertise \\"human safaris,\\" promising glimpses of Mashco Piro tribespeople along riverbanks. [See Photos of the Uncontacted Amazon Tribes]      As a result of these largely unplanned, uncontrolled contacts, some anthropologists argue for deliberate contact with isolated peoples. (Most uncontacted tribes do have limited interactions with their neighbors and are aware of the outside world, but choose to maintain an isolated and nomadic lifestyle in the forest.)      \\"Unless protection efforts against external threats and accidental encounters are drastically increased, the chances that these tribes will survive are slim,\\" anthropologists Robert Walker of the University of Missouri and Kim Hill of Arizona State University wrote in an editorial in the journal Science in June.      Controlled contact — with medical treatment available for inevitable disease transmission — is safer, Hill and Walker argued.      \\"A well-designed contact can be quite safe, compared to the disastrous outcomes from accidental contacts,\\" they wrote. \\"But safe contact requires a qualified team of cultural translators and health care professionals that is committed to staying on site for more than a year.\\"      Organizations such as Survival International strongly oppose contact, arguing instead for strict protections of native land. Given activities such as illegal logging and drug trafficking, however, those protections can be hard to enforce.      The Mashco Piro have been making their own forms of contact, according to Reuters. Members of the tribe attacked a settlement of the Machiguenga tribe in May 2015, killing one man. Another clash in 2011 between locals and the tribe reportedly left one dead and a park ranger injured. Two groups of uncontacted Peruvians approached Brazilian authorities in July and August 2014, saying they had been attacked by non-Indians, possibly drug runners or illegal loggers.      Peruvian policy usually calls for leaving isolated tribes alone, but these incidents have led to an exception. The goal of the planned contact is to find out why the Mashco Piro have been emerging from the forest more frequently, in hopes of preventing more clashes.      \\"In 2014, there were 70 sightings of Mashco Piro on the beaches of the river,\\" Patricia Balbuena, the deputy minister of multiculturalism in Peru, told the newspaper El Comercio. In 2015, she said, there have already been five raids on local communities by the group.      Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter and Google+. Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Despite displacements, epidemics, and hostile interactions with outsiders, such tribes still manage to survive. How can we ensure the well-being of humanity's last known isolated peoples under such enormous and mounting pressure from external threats?      Generally, the current policy of governments, primarily those of Brazil and Peru, and supported by the United Nations, is a “leave them alone” strategy. There are two implicit assumptions in a no-contact approach, however: that isolated populations are viable in the long term, and that they would choose isolation if they had full information (i.e., if they were aware that contact would not lead to massacre and enslavement). The first assumption is unlikely. Ethnohistorical accounts reveal the real risk of severe depopulation or extinction during intermittent hostile and sporadic interaction with the outside world. Miners, loggers, and hunters penetrate into the homelands of isolated tribes despite government “protection.” Unless protection efforts against external threats and accidental encounters are drastically increased, the chances that these tribes will survive are slim. Disease epidemics, compounded by demographic variability and inbreeding effects, makes the disappearance of small, isolated groups very probable in the near future. The second assumption is also unlikely. Interviews indicate that contacted groups had mainly chosen isolation out of fear of being killed or enslaved, but they also wanted outside goods and innovations and positive social interactions with neighbors.      “Controlled contact with isolated peoples is a better option than a no-contact policy.” PHOTO: © SPLASH NEWS/CORBIS      Controlled contact with isolated peoples is a better option than a no-contact policy. This means that governments should initiate contact only after conceiving a well-organized plan. In the past, there have been many poorly planned contacts with isolated Amazonian tribes by both missionaries and government agencies. The absence of health care professionals and health monitoring led to many deaths of these vulnerable peoples. One of us (K.R.H.) was on site within weeks of the first peaceful contacts with Aché, Yora, Mascho-Piro, and Matsiguenga communities in Paraguay and Peru when they were extremely isolated and suffering from new contact-related epidemics (from the late 1970s to mid-1980s), even though intermittent contact (mostly accidental) had occurred for 25 years. The most important lesson learned from these experiences is that mortality can be reduced to near zero if the contact team is prepared to provide sustained, around-the-clock medical treatment, as well as food. A well-designed contact can be quite safe, compared to the disastrous outcomes from accidental contacts. But safe contact requires a qualified team of cultural translators and health care professionals that is committed to staying on site for more than a year. For example, foreign missionaries provided great care for the Yora for up to 6 months, but when they decided to take a furlough, dozens of Yora died within a few weeks. Similarly, in 1975, missionaries provided care to an Aché community for a year, but when they took a vacation, many Aché died. Fortunately, there have been some success stories such as a 1978 contact with a band of Northern Aché. Missionaries and anthropologists treated them with antibiotics when primary respiratory infections progressed to pneumonia. They also provided food to the sick.      Given that isolated populations are not viable in the long term, well-organized contacts are today both humane and ethical. We know that soon after peaceful contact with the outside world, surviving indigenous populations rebound quickly from population crashes, ,with growth rates over 3% per year. Once a sustained peaceful contact occurs, it becomes much easier to protect native rights than it otherwise would be for isolated populations. Leaving groups isolated, yet still exposed to dangerous and uncontrolled interactions with the outside world, is a violation of governmental responsibility. By refusing authorized, well-planned contacts, governments are simply guaranteeing that accidental and disastrous contacts will take place instead. ||||| LIMA (Reuters) - Peru will try to make contact for the first time with an Amazonian tribe that largely lives isolated in the jungle, part of a bid to ease tensions with nearby villages after a bow-and-arrow attack in May, authorities said on Tuesday.      Members of the Mashco-Piro tribe observe a group of travelers from across the Alto Madre de Dios river in the Manu National Park in the Amazon basin of southeastern Peru, as photographed through a bird scope October 21, 2011. REUTERS/Jean-Paul Van Belle      Government anthropologists will try to talk with a clan of Mashco Piro Indians to understand why they have been emerging from the forest, said deputy culture minister Patricia Balbuena.      In recent years the Mashco Piro have increasingly been spotted seeking machetes and food outside their jungle enclaves in the Manu National Park in southeastern Peru.      Villagers, Christian proselytizers and tourists have all interacted with the tribe, often giving them clothes and food.      “The only ones who haven’t been in contact with them are representatives of the state!” said Balbuena.      Peru prohibits contact with the Mashco Piro and another dozen “uncontacted” tribes, mainly because their immune systems carry little resistance to common illnesses.      Authorities have said they cannot keep people from defying the contact ban because no penalty is attached.      Indigenous group FENAMAD warned that the decision to contact the Mashco Piro could legitimize the kind of unwanted interactions that have decimated isolated tribes in the past.      “Authorities should restrict boat transit and keep people from approaching,” said FENAMAD president Klaus Quicque.      Luis Felipe Torres, the head of the state isolated tribes team, said the government will not forcibly contact the Mashco Piro or try to change their nomadic lifestyle.      “But we can no longer pretend they aren’t trying to make some sort of contact,” Torres said. “They have a right to that, too.”      The Mashco Piro have historically rejected outsiders, surviving enslavement during Peru’s bloody rubber boom in the late 1800s and later rebuffing missionaries.      But in the past year, the Mashco Piro have appeared in populated areas more than 100 times, especially along the banks of a river where they gesture to passersby, said Balbuena.      Not all interactions with outsiders have been peaceful.      In May, a group of Mashco Piro attacked the native Machiguenga community of Shipetiari, killing a young man with an arrow.      In 2011 the Mashco Piro killed another local man and wounded a park ranger with arrows.      Using interpreters of Yine, a native language similar to the Mashco Piro tongue, the government hopes to prevent future clashes, Balbuena said.      A team of doctors six hours upriver would treat the tribe if disease breaks out, Balbuena said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"The Peruvian government plans to make its first contact with the Mashco Piro, an isolated tribe that live in the Amazon rainforest.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine.

However, inherited variation could be seen, and Darwin's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable. It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation.

We have this problem: -469*r - 851 = -246*r - 246*r First, let's add the two -246*r together. It's like having two baskets with -246 apples each, and we want to see how many apples we have in total. So, we have: -469*r - 851 = -492*r (because -246 + -246 = -492) Now, we want to get all the r (apples) on one side and the numbers on the other side. Let's add 492*r to both sides of the equation to get the r's together: -469*r + 492*r - 851 = -492*r + 492*r This simplifies to: 23*r - 851 = 0 (because -469 + 492 = 23) Next, we want to get rid of the -851, so let's add 851 to both sides of the equation: 23*r - 851 + 851 = 0 + 851 This simplifies to: 23*r = 851 Now, to find out how many apples (r) we have, we will divide by 23 on both sides: 23*r / 23 = 851 / 23 This gives us: r = 37 So, little buddy, r is equal to 37!

He was known for his boundless energy and adventurous spirit. He had an insatiable thirst for knowledge and constantly sought out new experiences. One day, while exploring the dense forest near his home, Daniel stumbled upon a mysterious cave. Its entrance appeared ancient and was covered in strange symbols that he had never seen before. His curiosity piqued, Daniel decided that he simply must explore the cave, thinking about all the untold secrets and wonders that might be hidden within. As he delved deeper into the cave, the walls began to glow with a soft light, illuminating the path before him. He noticed that the symbols he had seen earlier were etched on the cave's walls, growing more intricate as he progressed. It wasn't long before he found himself standing in a grand chamber, its walls adorned with murals depicting a world filled with fantastic creatures and landscapes. In the center of the chamber, there was an ancient, worn pedestal with an enormous book resting upon it. The book, adorned with gold and encrusted with precious stones, seemed to call out to him. Unable to resist its allure, Daniel approached and opened the book. A sense of excitement and fear flooded him as he began to lose himself in the contents of its pages. As he read, the images on the walls seemed to come alive, and Daniel found himself transported into the stories they depicted. He embarked on astonishing adventures, battling powerful sorcerers, taming fire-breathing dragons, and discovering unimaginable treasures. With every turn of a page, he traveled to new worlds, making allies and enemies while unraveling ancient mysteries. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as Daniel immersed himself in the tales and exploits that the magical book had to offer. The more he explored, the more the line between reality and the realms of the book blurred. He began to feel as if this was where he truly belonged – in a world where his boundless energy and curiosity were matched by the boundless possibilities within the pages of the book. However, Daniel soon realized that he was growing weary. A lifetime of adventures may have been enticing, but he began to miss his family, friends, and the quiet village he called home. He decided that he must leave the fantastical world behind and return to the life he knew and cherished. Closing the massive book, Daniel felt the stories and their respective realities fade away, leaving him in the now dimly lit chamber. As he found his way back through the cave, retracing the path he had taken what felt like years ago, the symbols on the walls seemed to whisper goodbye, as if recognizing that he was leaving their world behind. Daniel emerged from the cave, and to his amazement, the sun was setting on the same day he had entered. No time had passed in his world, but Daniel knew that he had experienced a lifetime worth of adventures. Exhausted, yet content, he returned to his home, reflecting on the lessons he had gleaned during his time in the book's magical realms. He knew that his village held boundless joy and wonder if only he paid attention. As Daniel lay down in his bed, surrounded by familiar sights, sounds, and scents, the weight of his adventures began to take its toll. Then I slept the longest I ever have in my whole life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who started calling himself Varg Vikernes?  In the 1980s, a young guitarist called Euronymous forms a black metal band called Mayhem, the first of the genre in their country of Norway, with Necrobutcher on bass, and  Manheim on drums. Manhein leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, which he portrays during their live shows by cutting himself and bleeding on the audience, and throwing pig heads at the \\"posers\\". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band. Soon after, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label and opens a record shop called Helvete, which becomes a social hub for black-metallers like Metalion, Fenriz of Darkthrone, Faust of Emperor, and Kristian (who is now calling himself Varg Vikernes) of Burzum. They become known as the \\"Black Circle\\". After being mocked by an ego-driven Euronymous, Varg uses his anti-Christian beliefs as motivation to burn down a local church. When approached by Varg concerning his status as the leader of the Black Circle, Euronymous burns down a church with Faust and Varg accompanying. Euronymous recruits Varg as bassist, a guitarist called Blackthorn and a Hungarian vocalist, Attila Csihar, to record Mayhem's first album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. A power dispute between Varg and Euronymous arises.

News article: Director presents proposal for feature while working on CG short for Ghibli Museum      In the NHK television special Owaranai Hito Miyazaki Hayao (The Man Who Is Not Done: Hayao Miyazaki ) on Sunday, acclaimed anime director Hayao Miyazaki reported that he wants to return to making an anime feature film, after retiring from directing feature films three years ago. He has been working on \\" Kemushi no Boro \\" ( Boro the Caterpillar ), a planned CG short for the Ghibli Museum.      However, the special revealed that Miyazaki was not satisfied with the CG project as a short, and he presented a project proposal for a feature-length film this past August. He also noted that if a feature would take him five years to make, he would be 80 years old at the end. In the schedule listed in his proposal, Miyazaki suggested that the film could be done by 2019, before the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki commented that Miyazaki will draw storyboards until he dies, and another staffer dryly noted that this would make the movie a huge hit.      Despite not officially receiving a green-light for the feature film, Miyazaki decided to start animation work on the project anyway. He plans on creating storyboards for about 100 cuts of footage.      In spite of his earlier retirement announcements, Miyazaki confirmed that he will continue animating shorts for the Studio Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. The 12-minute \\" Kemushi no Boro \\" short will not be completed for about another year and will be screened exclusively at Ghibli Museum. Miyazaki planned the story for almost 20 years and describes the short as \\"a story of a tiny, hairy caterpillar, so tiny that it may be easily squished between your fingers.\\"      Miyazaki rose to prominence in the 1970s on such television anime series as Lupin III , Future Boy Conan , and Sherlock Hound . He directed his first feature film, Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro , in 1979. He then adapted the beginning of his Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga into an anime film in 1984, before he and fellow director Isao Takahata founded Studio Ghibli .      With Ghibli, Miyazaki helmed the feature films Laputa: Castle in the Sky , My Neighbor Totoro , Kiki's Delivery Service , Porco Rosso , Princess Mononoke , Spirited Away , Howl's Moving Castle , Ponyo , and finally, 2013's The Wind Rises . He also co-produced Takahata's directorial efforts and directed smaller projects such as the \\"experimental film\\" On Your Mark and Ghibli Museum Shorts such as Mei and the Kitten Bus and Mr. Dough and the Egg Princess . ||||| If you’re a fan of lush animation, iconic characters, and evocative, thematically resonant filmmaking, then here are some words that should be music to your ears: Hayao Miyazaki is coming out of retirement for one last film. At least, if Studio Ghibli—the exceptional animation house he helped found in 1985—wants him back.      But that would seem to be a perfunctory question. Miyazaki, 75, has been at the helm for all of the studio’s most prestigious, well-received releases, including 1984’s Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, 1988’s My Neighbor Totoro, 1997’s Princess Mononoke, and 2001’s Spirited Away, which claimed an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. In short, Miyazaki is the central creative force behind some of the most renowned animated feature films in Japan’s history, stories that have made their way throughout the world.      Hayao Miyazaki is stepping out of retirement for one final film, if Studio Ghibli says yes.https://t.co/60tOKslanJ pic.twitter.com/cbunleCWiv — io9 (@io9) November 13, 2016      It’s not the first time Miyazaki has emerged from the shadows with the promise of at least one more feature film. In fact, as Gizmodo notes, he’s kind of an old hand at this pseudo-retirement stuff—he’s come out of prematurely declared retirements multiple times in the past, most recently returning to the industry in 2013 when he worked on Ghibli short film Kemushi no Boro.      And, for the record, that’s what the new film will be: a feature-length version of Kemushi no Boro, the tale of a tiny caterpillar that the legendary writer/director/animator didn’t feel he could fit in the space of 20 minutes.      While it’s impossible to know how long the new film will take to produce, it wouldn’t come as no surprise if it takes a while, owing to Miyazaki’s notoriously high standards and willingness to take his time. He’s reportedly hoping it’ll be done within five years, which means he could be 80 years old by the time it’s completed.      But this is fantastic news for any Miyazaki devotee, or fans of moving and beautiful animated stories more generally. If there’s any news that can start to brighten up a decidedly gloomy 2016, maybe this can be it. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Renowned anime director Hayao Miyazaki, who retired from directing feature films three years ago, has expressed his desire to return for a new project.

Summarize: The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the trade deficit shrank to £9.1bn from £9.4bn in January. Economists had expected a deficit of £9.2bn. Imports fell 2.2% to £32.6bn in February, helping to offset a 1.6% fall in exports to £23.5bn - the lowest level of exports since November 2010. The UK trade deficit is the measure of the difference between the value of goods the country exports compared with the value of the goods it imports. The ONS said imports of aircraft and aircraft parts fell 46.3% in February, contributing to three quarters of the total fall in imports in the month. Imports were also at their lowest level since April 2011. The ONS said in the three months to the end of February, the goods trade deficit narrowed by £3bn to £26.2bn representing a fall in exports of 0.1% while imports were lower by 3.5%. The UK's goods trade deficit with non-EU countries narrowed sharply to £2.9bn n February from £3.9bn January, against forecasts for a gap of £3.4bn. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the trade deficit figures would be a modest drag on first quarter economic growth. He added: \\"Looking ahead, net trade will likely struggle to make a sustained, significant positive contribution to UK growth in the near term at least as imports are likely to continue to be underpinned by decent UK domestic demand. \\"Nevertheless, the hope has to be that exports will increasingly benefit from global growth gradually picking up over the coming months.\\" The overall trade deficit in goods and services for February was £2.1bn, compared with a £2.2bn deficit a month earlier, thanks to the UK's trade surplus in its dominant services sector. Although the trade deficit fell, the drop in exports means the latest figures provide mixed news for the Chancellor George Osborne's hopes of rebalancing the economy by boosting exports and reducing the UK's reliance on its services sector and consumer spending. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said exports as well as business investment in the UK were disappointing, despite raising its forecast for economic growth in the UK this year to 2.9%. Commenting on the trade figures, David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce  said: \\"Judging by present trends it will be incredibly hard to meet the Prime Minister's export target of increasing exports to £1tn by 2020. \\"The recent announcement by the chancellor that the Bank of England will make a contribution to supporting export finance is welcome, but much more needs to be done.\\"","output":"The UK trade deficit is the difference between the value of stuff we sell to other countries (exports) and the value of stuff we buy from them (imports). In February, the trade deficit became smaller, going from £9.4 billion to £9.1 billion. That's good news! Why? Because selling more stuff to other countries or buying fewer things from them can help our economy grow. However, our exports also went down, which isn't great because that means we're not selling as many things to other countries. This creates a mixed situation for the UK and shows that we still need to work on selling more of our stuff to people in other countries to keep growing our economy."},{"instruction":"Question: I have a new situation: Two neighboring planets identical to Earth in size and atmospheric conditions behaved differently towards their environments. Planet A emitted a lot of air pollution, destroying its ozone layer, while Planet B respected the environment and used ecological products.  But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.

Professional background: Both William King and Antonio Murray were once officers in the Baltimore Police Department, which shows that they had law enforcement experience and held positions of authority. 2. Legal trouble and involvement in criminal activity: The bio states that both King and Murray were involved in drug dealing. This highlights their participation in illegal activities while they were serving as police officers. 3. FBI investigation and arrests: An FBI investigation in 2005 led to their arrest and subsequent sentencing. This underscores the severity of their criminal activities and the involvement of federal law enforcement in holding them accountable. 4. Sentencing and punishment: The combined sentence of both former officers totaled 454 years in prison. This reveals the gravity of their crimes and the justice system's efforts to make an example of their misconduct. 5. Connection to the 'Stop Snitchin' campaign: The conviction of both officers was partly due to the Baltimore-based \\"Stop Snitchin'\\" campaign. In this instance, King and Murray were identified on a videotape as being involved in the drug trade. The campaign itself was aimed at undermining the efficacy of law enforcement by intimidating potential witnesses and informants. 6. Testimonies from drug dealers: Drug dealers themselves testified against King and Murray, reporting that the two officers engaged in robbery, extortion, and the use of excessive force against them. This highlights an unusual collaboration between criminals and law enforcement to bring King and Murray to justice. 7.

The 1979 book by French philosopher Catherine Clément, Opera: The Undoing of Women, explores this opera in five acts that premiered at the Opéra-Comique in the early 1900 and was conducted by which conductor?","output":"Catherine Clément's 1979 book, \\"Opera: The Undoing of Women,\\" or \\"L'opéra ou La Défaite des femmes\\" in French, offers a feminist perspective on the representation of women in operas throughout history. The book critiques the portrayal of women as submissive, victimized, or sacrificial figures in opera's narrative, exposing the genre's inherent patriarchal structure. The specific opera in question you are referring to is not explicitly mentioned in the prompt, but given the details, it seems likely that the work you are referring to is Claude Debussy's \\"Pelléas et Mélisande.\\" This opera in five acts premiered at the Opéra-Comique in the early 1900s, specifically on April 30, 1902. \\"Pelléas et Mélisande\\" is based on Maurice Maeterlinck's symbolist play of the same name. The story revolves around a love triangle involving Prince Golaud, his younger brother Pelléas, and the enigmatic Mélisande, whom Golaud finds weeping in the forest one day and decides to marry. As the story unfolds, Mélisande eventually falls in love with Pelléas, leading to tragic consequences for the characters involved. For the premiere of \\"Pelléas et Mélisande\\" at the Opéra-Comique in 1902, it was conducted by André Messager. Messager was a famous French composer and conductor who was particularly known for his work in the world of opera. Throughout his career, he held various significant positions such as the director of the Opéra-Comique and the conductor at the Royal Opera House in London. It is important to note that Clément's critique in \\"Opera: The Undoing of Women\\" does not specifically focus on \\"Pelléas et Mélisande.\\" Instead, her book explores numerous operas and their impact on the portrayal of women in this art form. Nonetheless, as the opera you are referring to fits the description of \\"Pelléas et Mélisande,\\" it would be reasonable to consider André Messager as the conductor you are looking for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\".  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of   - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.  - In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain.  - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands.  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city.  - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.  - Parastacidae is the family of freshwater crayfish found in the southern hemisphere . The family is a classic Gondwana - distributed taxon , with extant members in South America , Madagascar , Australia , New Zealand and New Guinea , and extinct taxa also in Antarctica .  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.  - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface.  - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - In paleogeography, Gondwana, also Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient supercontinent. It is believed to have sutured between about 573 and 510 million years ago (Mya), joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. Gondwana formed prior to Pangaea, and later became part of it.  - Procambarus clarkii is a freshwater crayfish species, native to the Southeastern United States, but found also on other continents, where it is often an invasive pest. It is known variously as the red swamp crawfish, red swamp crayfish, Louisiana crawfish, Louisiana crayfish or mudbug.  - Lobsters comprise a family (Nephropidae, sometimes also Homaridae) of large marine crustaceans.

In 1988 in Brooklyn, New York, Bobby Green (Joaquin Phoenix) is the manager of the successful El Caribe nightclub in Brighton Beach that is frequented by Russian black market gangster and drug lord Vadim Nezhinski (Alex Veadov), and owned by Marat Buzhayev, Vadim's uncle and Bobby's boss.Bobby has distanced himself from his father, NYPD Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky (Robert Duvall), and his brother, Captain Joseph Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg). He uses the maiden name of his mother, Carol Green, as his last name, preferring to remain on the sidelines and enjoy a hedonistic life with his girlfriend Amada Juarez (Eva Mendes) and best friend Louis \\"Jumbo\\" Falsetti (Danny Hoch).When Joseph leads a police raid on El Caribe in the hopes of arresting Vadim, Bobby refuses to cooperate. The incident strains Bobby's relationship with his father and brother even more, to the point that Bobby and Joseph come to blows.The police are unsuccessful in making a case against Vadim, who decides to retaliate. The next evening, Joseph is shot by a masked assailant, and his unmarked police cruiser firebombed. Joseph survives the ambush, but is hospitalized for four months. Vadim, unaware of Bobby's family ties, confides that the Chief will be the next victim. Bobby resolves to help the police. Without his father's knowledge, Bobby goes undercover inside Vadim's cocaine-smuggling operation with a police listening device hidden in a cigarette lighter, but when the device is discovered, he narrowly escapes being murdered, and the police raid the operation and arrest Vadim.Bobby and Amada are placed in protective police custody, and their relationship begins to deteriorate. Months later, Vadim escapes custody while being transported to a hospital. The police prepare to move Bobby and Amada to a new location.

The text can be translated to English as, \\"I am moving. I am approaching the train station.\\" The Czech language is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian languages and shares many similarities with these languages in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The Czech language uses the Latin script supplemented by several diacritical marks, which are used to indicate pronunciation. The standard variety of Czech is based on the dialect spoken in Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic. Czech grammar is characterized by a complex system of cases (all nouns, adjectives, and pronouns are inflected for seven grammatical cases), numerous inflections for verbs (indicating tense, mood, aspect, voice, and person), and a rich vocabulary with many loanwords from Latin, German, and English. Czech also features complex consonant clusters, which can be difficult for non-native speakers to pronounce. Some examples of Czech words with such clusters are \\"zmrzlina\\" (ice cream), \\"štěstí\\" (happiness), and \\"čtvrtek\\" (Thursday). The Czech language has a long literary tradition, with some of the most famous Czech authors including Franz Kafka (although he wrote primarily in German), Milan Kundera, and Bohumil Hrabal. Important historical figures who contributed to the development of the Czech language include Jan Hus, a religious reformer who proposed a reform of orthography and grammar in the early 15th century, and Josef Dobrovský, an Enlightenment-era linguist who wrote the first Czech grammar book. In the Czech Republic, the Czech language is the primary medium of communication in various domains, including education, government, law, and media. The Czech Republic is also a member of the European Union, and the Czech language is one of the 24 official languages of the EU."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is spoken by 290 million people across the Strait of Malacca, including the coasts of the Malay Peninsula of Malaysia and the eastern coast of Sumatra in Indonesia, and has been established as a native language of part of western coastal Sarawak and West Kalimantan in Borneo. It is also used as a trading language in the southern Philippines, including the southern parts of the Zamboanga Peninsula, the Sulu Archipelago and the southern predominantly Muslim-inhabited municipalities of Bataraza and Balabac in Palawan.  As the \\"Bahasa Kebangsaan\\" or \\"Bahasa Nasional\\" (National Language) of several states, Standard Malay has various official names. In Singapore and Brunei it is called \\"Bahasa Melayu\\" (Malay language); in Malaysia, \\"Bahasa Malaysia\\" (Malaysian language); and in Indonesia, \\"Bahasa Indonesia\\" (Indonesian language) and is designated the \\"Bahasa Persatuan/ Pemersatu\\" (\\"unifying language/ \\"lingua franca\\"\\"). However, in areas of central to southern Sumatra where the language is indigenous, Indonesians refer to it as \\"Bahasa Melayu\\" and consider it one of their regional languages.  Standard Malay, also called Court Malay, was the literary standard of the pre-colonial Malacca and Johor Sultanates, and so the language is sometimes called Malacca, Johor, or Riau Malay (or various combinations of those names) to distinguish it from the various other Malayan languages. According to \\"Ethnologue\\" 16, several of the Malayan varieties they currently list as separate languages, including the \\"Orang Asli\\" varieties of Peninsular Malay, are so closely related to standard Malay that they may prove to be dialects—these are listed with question marks in the infobox at right or on top (depending on device).
