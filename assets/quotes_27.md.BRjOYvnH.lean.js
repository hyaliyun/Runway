(WHDH) - The Donahue family learned of ‘Whitey’ Bulger’s prison murder through text messages Tuesday morning.      And Tommy Donahue, whose father, Michael, was among the 11 murder victims linked to the notorious South Boston mob moss, said his immediate reaction was elation.      “I grew up going to Catholic school,” Tommy Donahue said. “It just brings me a lot of joy knowing that for the rest of his life, he’ll be getting a pitchfork in his (expletive) from the devil himself to eternity.”      The Donahues are somewhat relieved to put this chapter of their lives behind them.      “Thirty-something years of him putting my family in distraught, finally it’s all over,” Donahue said. “We weren’t ever going to be able to move on until he was dead.”      Tommy and his mother Pat attended nearly every court appearance Bulger made and when the crime boss was convicted for killing Donahue’s dad, Tommy said he hoped the next time he saw Bulger was on his deathbed.      “I said ‘next time I’m going to talk to the media will be when he’s dead,'” Donahue said. “Very true. Here I am, a happier man.”      Tommy’s mother, Pat, also expressed relief following the 89-year-old’s death.      “I want to open a champagne bottle and pop that cork. That’s how I feel,” Pat Donahue said. “Whitey Bulger meant nothing to me.”      The Donahues said that while they wanted Bulger to sit in prison for all of his crimes, especially the murders, getting killed in prison wasn’t the easy way out.      “He died the way he lived,” Pat Donahue said. “He killed people and he was killed.”      Pat Donahue is working on a documentary about Bulger’s trial.

Victim's Fam Says Justice was Served      Whitey Bulger Killers Tried to Remove His Tongue, Victim's Fam Thinks Justice was Done      Exclusive Details      Whitey Bulger was targeted for a mob hit and the killers did what mob killers do with so-called \\"rats\\" -- they try to cut out their tongue and gouge their eyes out.      Sources at the USP Hazelton prison in West Virginia tell TMZ, Bulger was killed in his cell at around 6 AM Tuesday, NOT in a common area as first reported. We're told 4 inmates walked into the cell where Whitey was sitting in his wheelchair.      They brutally beat him with a lock in a sock and used a shiv to try and gouge his eyes out. They also attempted to cut out his tongue. We're told there was a lot of blood in Bulger's mouth but we don't know if the tongue was actually removed.      We're told surveillance cameras captured the 4 inmates walking into Bulger's cell and walking out with their clothes clearly bloodied. The attack was not caught on video.      We're told the killers went back to their cells, changed out of their bloody clothes and then walked back to Bulger's cell with a mop and a bucket to clean up the mess.      As for the motive ... our prison sources say prison officials believe it was mob retaliation because Bulger was considered a rat and an informant who helped put away several members of the mob.      The officials believe the mob put out a hit on Bulger and removal of the eyes and tongue are signs of such a hit.      BTW ... Patricia Donahue -- the widow of Michael Donahue whom Bulger killed in 1982 -- reacted to the news by saying justice was served. She also told us how she plans to celebrate. Her son, Tommy, agreed, saying how Bulger's death brought some much-needed relief.

(Associated Press)      FILE - This undated file FBI photo found in Boston during an evidence search and released Dec. 30, 1998, shows James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger. Officials with the Federal Bureau of Prisons said Bulger died Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018, in a West Virginia prison after being sentenced in 2013 in Boston to spend the rest... (Associated Press)      BOSTON (AP) — A Mafia hit man who is said to hate \\"rats\\" is under suspicion in the slaying of former Boston crime boss and longtime FBI informant James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, who was found dead hours after he was transferred to a West Virginia prison, an ex-investigator briefed on the case said Wednesday.      The former official said that Fotios \\"Freddy\\" Geas and at least one other inmate are believed to have been involved in Bulger's killing. The longtime investigator was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity.      Authorities have not disclosed the cause of death.      Bulger's killing has raised questions of why he was transferred to the prison and why the 89-year-old was placed in the general population instead of special housing. He was found dead Tuesday.      Geas, 51, and his brother were sentenced to life in prison in 2011 for their roles in several violent crimes, including the 2003 killing of Adolfo \\"Big Al\\" Bruno, a Genovese crime family boss who was gunned down in a Springfield, Massachusetts, parking lot.      Private investigator Ted McDonough, who knew Geas, told The Boston Globe: \\"Freddy hated rats.\\"      \\"Freddy hated guys who abused women. Whitey was a rat who killed women. It's probably that simple,\\" McDonough told the newspaper, which first reported that Geas was under suspicion.      It was not clear whether Geas has an attorney. Several other lawyers who represented him over the years didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.      An FBI spokeswoman in Pittsburgh declined to comment on Geas. Federal officials said only that they are investigating the death as a homicide.      Bulger's death was the third killing in the past six months at the prison, where union officials have raised concerns about dozens of vacant jobs. Two inmates were killed in fights with other prisoners in September and April.      Five members of Congress wrote to Attorney General Sessions last week about what they saw as chronic understaffing at USP Hazelton and other federal prisons.      Bulger led South Boston's Irish mob for decades and became an FBI informant who supplied information on the New England Mafia, his gang's main rival, in an era when bringing down the Italian mob was a top national priority for the bureau.      Tipped off that he was about to be indicted, Bulger became a fugitive and eluded authorities for 16 years before being captured in 2011. He was convicted in 2013 in 11 underworld slayings and a long list of other crimes and was sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars.      He had just arrived Monday at USP Hazelton, a high-security prison in Bruceton Mills, West Virginia. He had previously been in a prison in Florida, with a stopover at a transfer facility in Oklahoma City. Federal Bureau of Prisons officials and his attorney declined to comment on why he was being moved.      Bulger's attorney, J.W. Carney Jr., blamed his death on prison officials, saying Bulger \\"was sentenced to life in prison, but as a result of decisions by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, that sentence has been changed to the death penalty.\\"      Bureau of Prison officials had no comment on Carney's remarks.      The Geas brothers were not made members of the Mafia because they were Greek, not Italian. But they were close associates of the mob and acted as enforcers.      ___      Associated Press reporters Eric Tucker and Mike Balsamo in Washington and John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia contributed to this report. ||||| When private investigator Ted McDonough heard that Freddy Geas was suspected by authorities of taking part in the murder of James “Whitey” Bulger, he knew immediately why Geas might have done it.      “Freddy hated rats,” said McDonough, using the slang for criminal informants. McDonough had become friendly with Geas while working for him as an investigator.      “Freddy hated guys who abused women. Whitey was a rat who killed women. It’s probably that simple,” McDonough said.      Advertisement      Fotios “Freddy” Geas — Mafia hitman, career criminal, prison lifer — did not like informants, and was almost certainly well aware of the fact that Bulger had led a charmed life for a long time as an informant for the FBI.      Get Metro Headlines in your inbox: The 10 top local news stories from metro Boston and around New England delivered daily. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here      People with knowledge of the investigation said that Bulger had requested to be housed in general population at the federal prison in Hazelton, W. Va., where he had just been transferred from a federal prison in Florida after a brief stop in Oklahoma.      Geas is serving a life sentence at the prison in Hazelton for his role in the assassination of Adolfo “Big Al” Bruno, the onetime head of the Mafia in Springfield, after both the man who ordered him to kill Bruno and the hitman he dispatched to do the murder turned on him and testified against him.      People familiar with the investigation suggest that Bulger was murdered by more than one of his fellow inmates, and that Geas didn’t dispute his role in the killing.      RELATED: The long and deadly career of ‘Whitey’ Bulger      David Hoose, the lawyer who initially represented Geas in the Mafia killings, said he was not surprised to hear that Geas didn’t dispute his role in Bulger’s killing and refused to identify a possible accomplice.      Advertisement      “He wouldn’t rat on anybody,” Hoose said, “and he had no respect for anyone who would.”      Freddy Geas, 51, and his brother Ty, 46, were a tag team pair of criminals from West Springfield who were well known, and feared, in Western Massachusetts. They have long rap sheets and were known for their violent impulsivity. When Ty Geas was 17, he was sentenced to a year in jail for firing an assault rifle into the air during a high school hockey game. Freddy Geas exhibited what would become a lifelong, violent animosity toward those who cooperate with the authorities, eventually pleading guilty to threatening to kill a witness against his brother.      Freddy Geas’s reputation for sudden, impulsive violence is long established. When a bar fight at a Springfield bar called Sh-Booms spilled onto the street in 1989, Freddy, then 22, wrecked an expensive vintage car parked outside. In 2006, he went to jail for beating a pair of men with a baseball bat at a strip club.      By that time, the Geas brothers were well known to local authorities as the hired muscle for an aspiring Mafia leader named Anthony Arillotta. Because they were Greek, the Geas brothers could not be “made” members of the Mafia, but they carried the mob’s imprimatur, according to Springfield and State Police.      “Nobody screwed with them,” McDonough said. “Freddy, especially.”      Advertisement      In 2009, Freddy Geas was charged with a series of crimes, including the hit on Al Bruno and the 2003 murder of Gary Westerman, Arillotta’s brother-in-law. He was also charged with being the getaway driver in the botched murder of Frank Dabado, a cement union boss in the Bronx. Dabado was targeted for murder after he and Artie Nigro, a Genovese crime family boss, had a fight over some Tony Bennett concert tickets.      RELATED: Inmate with Mafia ties investigated in Bulger’s killing      McDonough, the private investigator, said Freddy Geas was crushed to learn that the star witness against him was Arillotta, the Mafia up-and-comer who had groomed him.      Arillotta’s testimony described a chaotic scene right out of a Martin Scorcese movie. After Freddy Geas shot Westerman in the head twice, the mortally wounded Westerman tried to break free from the Geas brothers as they dragged him to a grave. Arillotta testified that he and Emilio Fusco, a Mafia soldier in the Genovese crime family, finished Westerman off by beating him to death with shovels.      Arillotta testified that Freddy Geas complimented the assembled murderers for good teamwork.      Freddy Geas was convicted of hiring the hitman who killed Bruno, who was murdered so that Arillotta could assume control of the Mafia in Springfield. Geas met that hitman, Frankie Roche, in prison and was his friend, police said. But like so many other people who once considered themselves Freddy Geas’s friend, Roche rolled on him.      In a 2007 statement to Springfield police that was obtained by the Globe, Roche admitted that he shot Bruno outside the Mount Carmel Society social club in Springfield.      “Freddy had called me earlier in the day and told me that Al was definitely going to be there,” Roche told police. “I killed Al Bruno because I was paid to do it. Freddy Geas is the person who paid me to do it.”      McDonough said that Geas harbored a special hatred for informants, criminals who saved their own skin by giving up others.      In 2016, Taylor Geas, Freddy’s daughter, wrote a piece for The Republican newspaper of Springfield, recalling that as a child she thought her father was never around because he was in the Army.      “My dad led a double life,” she said.      She could not reconcile the father she knew with the criminal whose exploits were well documented in newspapers and on television.      “The person I know is the father that would tuck me in at night, and tell me funny stories until I fell asleep,” she wrote. “He was the person that taught me how to throw a baseball, and got me my first pair of soccer cleats. When I look in the mirror I see his smile because I have the same one.”      TIMELINE: Bulger’s crimes, escape, capture, conviction, death      McDonough described Freddy Geas as extremely personable, but a committed criminal. They met regularly at the Cafe Manhattan, a bar in downtown Springfield.      “A good conversationalist,” McDonough said. But McDonough was under no illusions. “He liked me because I was his private investigator. You would not want Freddy as an enemy.”      McDonough speculated that if Freddy Geas killed Bulger, it would elevate him in the criminal hierarchy, especially among the Mafia, whose members and associates would have felt duty-bound to kill Bulger after they learned he had fed the FBI information about the Mafia in Boston.      For those whose loved ones were murdered by Bulger, and those who hunted him down and prosecuted him, Bulger’s demise brought a sense of relief — and irony, given that the suspect in his killing was believed to have been motivated by Bulger’s informant status. They said Bulger inflicted similarly terrible ends on others, especially those he suspected of being informants.      Tom Donahue, the son of one of Bulger’s victims, said he always assumed Bulger would die in prison of natural causes. He said he took comfort from knowing that Bulger experienced some of the pain that so many of his victims did.      “I think it’s justice,” said Donahue, whose father, Michael, an innocent truck driver, was murdered by Bulger.      Donahue said he hoped he would be able to put some money into Freddy Geas’s prison canteen account.      Shelley Murphy of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Often, redness and irritation is the result of over-exfoliating or using abrasive or harsh acne reducing products.  Stop using anything new you have put on your skin for at least 4 days, and consider switching to a gentler cleaning product.  Acne medicines using retinoids are particularly irritating. After 4 days, try using the product sparingly to see if irritation still occurs.  If so, throw it away. Do not introduce more than one product at a time to your skin, so you know which one is “too much.” A good cleanser should wash off all dirt and makeup, but not your skin’s natural oils.  If your skin feels tight or squeaky after washing, the product is too harsh.  Cetaphil and Eucerin are good products for sensitive skin.  Hot or cold water can damage capillaries and cause redness.  Hot water also dries your skin out quickly, causing redness.  Look for a cleanser made for your skin type, whether it tends to be oily or dry.  Foaming cleansers are generally bad for dry skin.  Avoid cleansers with harsh ingredients like sodium laureth sulfate, menthol or alcohol.  Avoid products with fragrances and dyes.

Well read on, as this month we're going to hear from overseas teens about what they do to help the environment. I can't remember when I started collecting litter . But it was when I got tired of seeing litter near my home and realized that no one else was going to pick it up. I live close to a forest in Ohio, America. I can walk there in three minutes! I used to love going there to play with my dog. But one day there was so much litter there that I became very unhappy. I decided I had to clean up the forest. I wanted to feel happy going there again. I made my first trip to clean the forest that afternoon. I took a big black rubbish bag with me. Ten minutes after starting to pick up litter, my bag was full! It had cans, bottles, broken glass and newspapers in it. Since that first trip three years ago. I've gone to the forest four times a year to pick up litter. I'm often there for three hours. It makes me feel great to do something for the environment. After each trip, I look at all the litter I've found. If any of it is recyclable , I keep it.I can't understand why people drop litter. But I will keep picking it up until they stop dropping it.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  After reading the above, is \\"Light and heat\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Where did man get fire and what luxuries did it provide?\\"? Possible answers: [-] no [-] yes","output":"yes \\"Light and heat\\" is the correct answer because Peking Man learned how to capture flame and keep it alight, which provided them with two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat.

Context: Early trauma-induced coagulopathy may increase susceptibility to nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, the relationship between trauma- induced coagulopathy and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia in spinal cord injury patients has not been evaluated.', 'We conducted a 5-year retrospective study of 300 spinal cord injury patients admitted to Level 1 trauma center. Standard coagulation studies were evaluated upon arrival, prior to fluid resuscitative efforts, and at 24 u200ah after admission. Based on these studies, three groups of patients were identified: no coagulopathy, latent coagulopathy, and admission coagulopathy. Ventilator- associated pneumonia was identified utilizing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Since we used the data in the trauma registry and did not have the information on FiO2 and PEEP, we elected to use the VAP terminology and not the VAE sequence. Demographic, injury, and clinical characteristics were compared among no coagulopathy, latent coagulopathy, and admission coagulopathy groups using chi-square test and ANOVA for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. A logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between coagulopathy and both ventilator-associated pneumonia and mortality.', 'The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia was 54.5% (OR 4.01, 95% CI 1.76-9.15) in spinal cord injury patients with admission coagulopathy, compared with the 17.5% in spinal cord injury patients with no coagulopathy. Mortality was significantly higher in spinal cord injury patients with admission coagulopathy than in spinal cord injury patients with no coagulopathy (OR 6.14, 95% CI 1.73-21.73).After adjusting for age, race, injury mechanism, Injury Severity Score, base deficit at admission, the number of pRBC units transfused in the first 24u200a h, and hospital stay, only the association of ventilator-associated pneumonia among those with admission coagulopathy remained significant (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.48-8.32). Compared with those with no coagulopathy, patients with admission coagulopathy had a higher odds of death (4.10, 95% CI 1.53-11.02), though this association lost significance after adjustment (OR 3.56, 95% CI 0.90-14.12). There was no statistical difference in mortality for latent coagulopathy compared with no coagulopathy patients. Answer: Coagulopathy on admission in patients with spinal cord injury is associated with a statistically significant increase in ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence. Additional research is warranted to further characterize this association. Output:","output":"What is the relationship between coagulopathy on admission in spinal cord injury patients and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Daryl Franklin Hohl (born October 11, 1946), better known by his stage name Daryl Hall, is an American rock, R&B, and soul singer; keyboardist, guitarist, songwriter, and producer, best known as the co-founder and lead vocalist of Hall & Oates (with guitarist and songwriter John Oates). In the 1970s and early 1980s, Hall scored numerous Billboard chart hits and is regarded as one of the best soul singers of his generation. Guitarist Robert Fripp, who collaborated with him in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has written, \\"Daryl's pipes were a wonder. I have never worked with a more able singer.\\" Hall was born in Pottstown, a Pennsylvania borough 40 miles (64 km) from Philadelphia. His parents each had a background in music: his father was a professional singer and his mother was a vocal coach. He is of German descent. He started recording while still a student at Owen J. Roberts High School, from which he graduated in 1965. In college at Temple University in Philadelphia, he majored in music, while continuing to record, working with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff as both an artist and a session musician. During his first semester at Temple, in the fall of 1965, he and four other white Temple University students formed the vocal harmony group the Temptones.  They were popular additions to the largely black Philly soul scene, defeating both The Ambassadors and The Delfonics in a contest at the Uptown Theater. The Temptones recorded a handful of singles for Arctic Records, produced by Jimmy Bishop. While performing at the Uptown theatre, Hall formed creative affiliations with such artists as Smokey Robinson, The Temptations, and many other top soul singers of the 1960s.  In 1967 Hall met John Oates, who was also an undergraduate at Temple University. According to Daryl Hall, they met when \\"We got in the middle of a fight at a dance - I have no idea what the fight was about. I guess the Greek letters on one gang's jackets didn't appeal to the other gang. We both beat it out the back and met on the elevator while leaving the place rather quickly.\\" Hall was by then a senior, while Oates was a freshman. They played together until Oates transferred to a different school at age 19. Hall did not let Oates' departure discourage him from pursuing his own musical career: he dropped out of college in 1968 and worked with Tim Moore in a short-lived rock band, Gulliver, and released an album on the Elektra Records label. In 1969 Hall again began recording songs by other artists, which led to the duo signing their first record contract in early 1972.

If the year is divisible by 100 (century years like 1900 or 2000), it cannot be a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400. Steps to find the answer: 1. Check if the given year (1176) is evenly divisible by 4. 2. If it is, check if the year is also divisible by 100. 3. If it is divisible by 100, then check if it is divisible by 400. 4.

Check if 1176 is evenly divisible by 4: 1176 ÷ 4 = 294 (No remainder, so it is evenly divisible.) 2. Check if 1176 is divisible by 100: It is not, as it does not end in 00. Since the year is not divisible by 100, we don't need to check for divisibility by 400. As the given year (1176) is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.

Write a summary based on this article: Over the dissents of three Justices, the Supreme Court on Tuesday evening barred Texas from enforcing two parts of its new abortion-restriction law — one part as it applied throughout the state, the other as it applied to two clinics in the southwest part of the state.      The state may not now enforce a requirement that all clinics in the state upgrade their facilities to be hospital-like surgical centers, even when they perform abortions only through the use of drugs, not surgery. And it may not enforce, against the clinics in McAllen and El Paso, a requirement that all doctors performing abortions have privileges to admit patients to a hospital within thirty miles of the clinic. That requirement can continue to be enforced elsewhere in Texas, the Court indicated.      Those two provisions, together, had reduced the number of clinics still operating in the state to seven, with an eighth soon to open. At one time recently, Texas had forty-one clinics. The Supreme Court’s action Tuesday will allow the reopening of thirteen closed clinics on Wednesday, lawyers for the clinics said.      The Court’s order will remain in effect while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rules on a constitutional challenge to the two measures. That court had previously upheld the admitting privileges requirement as it applied all across the state. Most recently, it had blocked a new ruling by a judge in Austin that seemed to invalidate the two provisions statewide.      The Supreme Court gave no explanation for the four-sentence order. It noted that Justices Samuel A. Alito, Jr., Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas would have refused to delay any part of the state requirements. They did not give their reasoning. It would have taken the votes of five Justices to block the provisions, so it appears that at least that number from among the other six Justices voted for the result. The Justices voting for the order were not noted.      In asking the Court to set aside, temporarily, the Fifth Circuit’s orders permitting enforcement of the two provisions, lawyers for the clinics had said that clinics closed as a result probably would not reopen unless those restrictions were lifted. They also contended that there had recently been an increase in the number of women seeking illegal abortions in areas where clinics could no longer provide services.      The seven clinics that were not affected by the new restrictions (and the eighth that is soon to open) were concentrated in the four largest metropolitan areas in the eastern part of the state. The lawyers had told the Court that, for the time being, there were no licensed facilities to provide abortions anywhere in the state south or west of San Antonio — “an area larger than most states.”      Texas officials had urged the Supreme Court not to block the new measures, arguing that they were necessary to protect the health of pregnant women in the state. They also argued that the challengers had exaggerated the practical impact of the new restrictions, and that most women would continue to have access to abortions within what they said was a reasonable driving distance.      The Fifth Circuit, in allowing the restrictions to go into or remain in effect, had found that they would not impose an “undue burden” on a significant fraction of the women in the state who would need abortion services.      The Supreme Court’s order is not a final ruling on the constitutionality of the new limitations, but is a strong indication that the state may have difficulty defending them, at least as statewide measures.      The Court’s order marked the first time in the Justices’ new Term that the abortion controversy had returned. There may be other tests of the Court’s current view on that controversy later in the Term.      Recommended Citation: Lyle Denniston, Court blocks abortion limits in Texas, SCOTUSblog (Oct. 14, 2014, 7:08 PM), http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/10/court-blocks-abortion-limits-in-texas/ ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked key parts of a 2013 law in Texas that had closed all but eight facilities providing abortions in America's second most-populous state.      In an unsigned order, the justices sided with abortion rights advocates and health care providers in suspending an Oct. 2 ruling by a panel of the New Orleans-based U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas could immediately apply a rule making abortion clinics statewide spend millions of dollars on hospital-level upgrades.      The court also put on hold a separate provision of the law only as it applies to clinics in McAllen and El Paso that requires doctors at the facilities to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The admitting privileges remains in effect elsewhere in Texas.      Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas said they would have ruled against the clinics in all respects.      The 5th Circuit is still considering the overall constitutionality of the sweeping measure overwhelmingly passed by the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry last year.      But even as it weighs the merits of the law, the appeals court said that it can be enforced in the meantime — opening the door for the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court.      The 5th Circuit decision had blocked an August ruling by Austin-based U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel, who had found that requiring hospital-style upgrades was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult. Yeakel's ruling temporarily suspended the upgrade rules before they could go into effect Sept. 1 — and the order from the Supreme Court means they are on hold again.      Allowing the rules on hospital-level upgrades to be enforced — including mandatory operating rooms and air filtration systems — shuttered more than a dozen clinics across Texas.      Until the nation's highest court intervened, only abortion facilities in the Houston, Austin, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth areas remained open. And none was left along the Texas-Mexico border or outside any of the state's largest urban areas.      Some other clinics, meanwhile, had closed even earlier amid enforcement of the rule on admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. That portion has already been upheld twice by the appeals court.      The fight over the Texas law is the latest over tough new abortion restrictions that have been enacted across the country. The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican who is the favorite in next month's governor's race, is leading the defense of the law.      Critics call the measure a backdoor effort to outlaw abortions.      Attorneys for the state have denied that Texas women would be burdened by fewer abortion facilities, saying nearly 9 in 10 would still live within 150 miles of a provider. The law's opponents, however, note that still leaves nearly a million Texas women embarking on drives longer than three hours to get an abortion.      Democrat Wendy Davis launched her campaign for governor behind the celebrity she achieved through a nearly 13-hour filibuster last summer that temporarily blocked the law in the state Senate.      ___      Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Austin, Texas. |||||","output":"The Supreme Court has barred Texas from enforcing two parts of its new abortion-restriction law, allowing 13 clinics to reopen. One provision prevented clinics from performing abortions through the use of drugs, not surgery, unless they had hospital-like surgical centers.

TL:DR: I un-professionally get mad at a customer and verbally slam the door on her way out. I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'.

Aged just 19, she was found guilty by the courts of sex outside of marriage -- adultery -- and sentenced to twelve years in jail. Now inside Kabul's Badam Bagh jail, she and her child are serving her sentence together. Sitting with the baby in her lap, her face carefully covered, she explains the only choice she has that would end her incarceration. The only way around the dishonor of rape, or adultery in the eyes of Afghans, is to marry her attacker. This will, in the eyes of some, give her child a family and restore her honor. Incredibly, this is something that Gulnaz is willing to do. \\"I was asked if I wanted to start a new life by getting released, by marrying this man\\", she told CNN in an exclusive interview. \\"My answer was that one man dishonored me, and I want to stay with that man.\\" Tending to her daughter in the jail's cold, she added: \\"My daughter is a little innocent child. Who knew I would have a child in this way. A lot of people told me that after your daughter's born give it to someone else, but my aunt told me to keep her as proof of my innocence.\\" Gulnaz's choice is stark. Women in her situation are often killed for the shame their ordeal has brought the community. She is at risk, some say, from her attacker's family. We found Gulnaz's convicted rapist in a jail across town. While he denied raping her, he agreed that she would likely be killed if she gets out of jail. But he insists that it will be her family, not his, that will kill her, \\"out of shame.\\" Whether threatened by his family or hers, for now, jail may be the safest place for her. Shockingly, Gulnaz's case is common in Afghanistan. CNN asked a spokesman for the prosecutor to comment on the case. The reply was that there were hundreds such cases and the office would need time to look into it. But Gulnaz's plight has found international attention because of a dispute between the European Union and a team of documentary makers hired to report on women's rights in Afghanistan. The documentary makers filmed a lengthy report on Gulnaz and other women, showing her talking openly about her fate. They showed the film to the EU, who were paying for it as part of a project on female rights here. After viewing it, the EU decided to spike the project. The EU said it was concerned about the safety of the women in the film: they could be identified and might face reprisals. The filmmakers however suspect -- citing an email leaked from the EU delegation -- that the EU might also be motivated by its sensitive relationship with Afghan justice institutions, since he film shows the Afghan justice system in a very unflattering light. The leaked email says: \\"The delegation also has to consider its relations with [Afghan] Justice institutions in connection with the other work that it is doing in the sector.\\" The EU Ambassador to Afghanistan, Vygaudas Usackas, rejected any political motivation in asking for the film not to be shown. \\"What I am concerned about is that situation of the women. About the security and well being, that's of paramount importance, the key criteria according to which I, as representative of the European Union will judge,\\" said the ambassdor. Under Afghan law, Gulnaz has been judged an adulterer. Despite the ongoing dispute over her story, her predicament has not changed. She faces the hideous choice of 12 years in jail or marriage to her rapist and risk death. It's a marriage she says she'll accept, so her child can continue to have a mother.

Determine the proper grammar and syntax for the Hebrew translation. 3. Translate each word and phrase into Hebrew, ensuring that the meaning and context are preserved. Now, let's perform these steps on the given sentence: والناس الذين أتحدث عنهم هم الناس الذين مثل — يقولون أنهم أعضاء لجنة تسمى ، دعنا نقل ، الهيئة الحكومية الدولية حول التغير المناخي. 1. Understanding the meaning: The sentence says, \\"The people I am talking about are those who - like - say they are members of a committee called, let's say, the International Governmental Body on Climate Change.\\" 2. Determine the proper grammar and syntax for the Hebrew translation: Hebrew is written from right to left, and the sentence structure typically follows a Subject-Verb-Object pattern. We will maintain those language rules in our final translation. 3. Translate each word and phrase into Hebrew: والناس (The people) - האנשים الذين أتحדث عنهم (I am talking about) - שאני מדבר עליהם هم (are) - הם مثل (like) - כמו يقولون (say) - אומרים أنهم (they) - שהם أعضاء (members) - חברים لجنة (committee) - ועדה تسمى (called) - בשם دعنا نقل (let's say) - בואו נגיד الهيئة الحكومية الدولية (International Governmental Body) - גוף הממשלתי הבין־לאומי حول (on) - על التغير المناخي (Climate Change) - שינוי האקלים Now, let's put the Hebrew words together in the proper grammar and phrasing: האנשים שאני מדבר עליהם הם האנשים ש - כמו - אומרים שהם חברים בוועדה בשם, בואו נגיד, גוף הממשלתי הבין-לאומי על שינוי האקלים.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: You may think your bathroom is often full of bacteria  and so you give it a complete cleaning once a week. But how often do you clean out and disinfect  your fridge? Well, probably not often enough, according to a recent study, which found out that the fridge is the second dirtiest place in your house, just behind the bathroom. Fridge temperatures were often set too high, allowing the growth of bacteria, which included E.coil, Enterobacteria, and S. aureus, all of which will give you an easy access to food poisoning. So what can you do to ensure your fridge---and your food in it---is not a health threat? For starters, clean the fridge weekly---wipe it and repeat. Make sure your fridge is at the correct temperature for storing food, between 0 and 5 degrees centigrade. Your freezer should be below-18 degrees centigrade. You can use fridge and freezer thermeters to make sure this is the case. Some modern fridges have zones to store different types of food ,such as meat and vegetables. Make sure you don\`t store meat in the vegetable zone, as the temperature there might be higher. Make sure you don not leave the door open too long as the temperature in the fridge will quickly rise, creating a breeding  ground for bacteria. Cover food that has not been finished, and eat it within a couple of days. Keep bottles and jars closed. Keep raw meat away from cooked meat. Both should be well covered to prevent pollution. Store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge to stop juices dripping onto other foods. Finally, use common sense, and throw away old food. Question: Which is the best temperature for storing your food in the fridge? Options: A: 10oC B: -2 oC C: 4 oC D: -18 oC Answer:","output":"C: 4 oC"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please add spaces between words: AccordingtotheBEAtheannualizedgrowthratehasincreasedfrom0.36of1%inthefirstquarterof2011tojustunder3%inthefourthquarter.","output":"According to the BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis), the annualized growth rate has increased from 0.36% or 1% in the first quarter of 2011 to just under 3% in the fourth quarter. The annualized growth rate, which measures the percentage increase over a year, is an important indicator of economic growth and overall economic health. In this case, the BEA is reporting that the growth rate has accelerated between the first quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter. The initial rate of 0.36% to 1% represents a relatively slow pace of growth. This suggests that the economy was not expanding rapidly during that period. This could be attributed to various factors, such as weak consumer demand, a lack of new investments, or uncertainties in the global economy. However, the fact that the growth rate increased to just under 3% in the fourth quarter indicates that the economy gained momentum over time. This acceleration could have been driven by several factors. For instance, increased consumer spending may have fueled business growth and helped create new jobs. Similarly, businesses may have started investing in new projects, thereby spurring economic growth. Moreover, this improvement in the growth rate may also be the result of government interventions aimed at stabilizing the economy, such as implementing monetary and fiscal policies. These policies could have included lowering interest rates to encourage borrowing and business expansion or introducing stimulus packages to boost consumer spending. It is also crucial to consider the global economic environment during this time. The financial performance of other countries and the state of international trade can significantly influence the growth rate of a nation's economy. In this context, any positive developments on the global front, such as a stable political environment or strong performance by trading partners, may have contributed to the increase in the annualized growth rate. In conclusion, according to the BEA, the annualized growth rate has shown a substantial improvement between the first quarter of 2011 (0.36% to 1%) and the fourth quarter (just under 3%). Various factors, such as increased consumer spending, business investment, government policies, and a stable global environment, could have contributed to this acceleration in economic growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them.  Does Brandon's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Jeff's?  Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Brandon's soil appears to have less toxic compounds than Jeff's because it is not hypoxic. Hypoxic soils tend to have an increased presence of toxic compounds due to inhibited nitrification and the formation of toxic substances as anaerobic bacteria use alternative electron acceptors like nitrate, manganese, and sulfate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: To the pope as to all his predecessors, marital relations are much more than a union of two people. They constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God, in which the two persons create a new person materially, while God completes the creation by adding the soul. For this reason, Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of Humanae vitae that the transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator. This divine partnership, according to Paul VI, does not allow for arbitrary human decisions, which may limit divine providence. The Pope does not paint an overly romantic picture of marriage: marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships. The question of human procreation exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as biology, psychology, demography or sociology. The reason for this, according to Paul VI, is that married love takes its origin from God, who \\"is love\\". From this basic dignity, he defines his position: What is the answer to this question: What does God contribute to a married couple's child?","output":"According to the article, God contributes the soul to a married couple's child.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. On the campaign trail, Otto Perez Molina vowed to rule his country with an iron fist. The retired general said he would send troops into the streets to fight drug violence. Analysts summed up his political platform with three words: law and order. Now -- just two months after taking office -- the 61-year-old Guatemalan president is pushing a controversial proposal that has come under fire from U.S. officials and earned praise from people who were once his critics. During a routine speech last month, Perez Molina slipped in a surprise announcement. Last year's law-and-order candidate said he wanted to legalize drugs. \\"What I have done is put the issue back on the table,\\" Perez Molina told CNN en Español. \\"I think it is important for us to have other alternatives. ... We have to talk about decriminalization of the production, the transit and, of course, the consumption.\\" The proposal caught many Guatemalans off guard. \\"Everyone was expecting him to copy the strategy of (Mexican President) Felipe Calderon and involve the military in fighting cartels,\\" said Martin Rodriguez Pellecer, director of Plaza Publica, an investigative journalism and analysis website in Guatemala. \\"Then he made this surprise announcement ... without even his foreign minister knowing about it.\\" The president's unexpected pitch grabbed global headlines -- and the attention of international leaders. Central American presidents are scheduled to debate the idea in Guatemala on Saturday. The meeting could pave the way for a significant policy shift in a region where brutal drug violence is a daily reality. 'Too high a human cost' The attackers left a warning written in blood on a white wall at a northern Guatemala farm: \\"I will find you and I will leave you like this.\\" Nearby, investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers. Authorities said members of the Zetas drug gang were behind the massacre last May in the province of Peten. Officials and analysts pointed to the slayings as more evidence of a devastating spike in drug-related violence across the region. At a conference on regional security last year, Guatemala's then-president, Alvaro Colom, said his country was reaching the limit of its ability to fight cartels. \\"Eight killed per ton (of cocaine) passing through Guatemala is a lot of blood. If you pass through Honduras, there are 20 murders, and if we add it up, a ton of cocaine has too high a human cost,\\" he said. Guatemala's murder rate is 42 per 100,000 people -- one of the highest in the world, according to a United Nations report. \\"The immense economic power of drug trafficking has corrupted all the spheres of the state. The violence is incredibly high,\\" said Mario David Garcia, a well-known Guatemalan lawyer and radio show host. Perez Molina isn't the first leader to propose that legalizing drugs may help stem the bloodshed. In a 2009 report, three former Latin American presidents -- Brazil's Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Colombia's Cesar Gaviria, and Mexico's Ernesto Zedillo -- called for decriminalizing cannabis for personal use. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox also has said he supports legalizing marijuana use. But analysts say sitting presidents rarely make such proposals, fearing political consequences. \\"This has been an academic debate and it has also been a scientific debate, an issue that has been studied. And bringing it back into political debate, I think, is important,\\" Perez Molina told CNN en Español last month. A political strategy? U.S. officials responded swiftly to Perez Molina's proposal. \\"The United States continues to oppose such measures because evidence shows that our shared drug problem is a major public health and safety threat,\\" the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala said in a statement a day after Perez Molina first floated his proposal. The embassy urged Guatemala and other countries in the region to continue fighting drug traffickers. \\"With increased cultivation and consumption of decriminalized drugs, crime in Central America could well increase as the drug cartels shift their focus to other forms of illicit activities,\\" the statement warned. Weeks later, on a trip to Mexico and Honduras, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said he was open to debating the issue. But he stressed that the United States would not waver from its policy against drug legalization. \\"If (Perez Molina's) strategy is a political strategy designed to get Washington's attention, then it worked,\\" said Samuel Logan, managing director of Southern Pulse, an online information network focused on Latin America. Some skeptics have suggested Perez Molina may be bluffing -- using the legalization debate to pressure U.S. officials into bringing back military aid to Guatemala. Such aid has been cut off for decades due to human rights abuses committed during the Central American nation's civil war. Guatemalan Defense Minister Ulises Noe Anzueto told CNN en Español Thursday that he was meeting with officials in Washington to discuss lifting the military aid embargo. \\"It's a question of a political decision,\\" he said. \\"At any moment this restriction could be lifted and help us become more efficient partners in meeting our responsibility to help with security for the region and therefore the continent.\\" John Walters, who directed the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy from 2001 to 2009, said decriminalization is \\"utterly self-defeating\\" and would cause more crime. He described Perez Molina's proposal as \\"a call for help and a call for U.S. leadership.\\" \\"They're telling us, 'We think we have to give up, because we don't think we can win,\\" Walters said. Details unclear as debate nears. Supporters of Perez Molina say Latin American nations should create new drug policies that don't follow in U.S. footsteps. The United States has not done enough to stop the demand for drugs, they argue, and many in Latin America are suffering the consequences. \\"All we're doing is, in effect, fighting a U.S. battle outside of U.S. borders,\\" said Ambassador Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister of Mexico who advocates drug legalization. Creating a regulated market and opting for a less militaristic approach should decrease violence, he said. \\"The fundamental problem of the violence ... is directly related to this so-called war on the cartels and this war on drug trafficking and the effort by the criminals to show that they have more money, more weapons, more people,\\" Rozental said. But could drug legalization efforts in the region work without U.S. backing? \\"Even if the United States is not willing at this point to go along, there is space for Latin American countries to take certain steps,\\" said Martin Jelsma, a political scientist who specializes in Latin America and international drugs policy at the Transnational Institute. \\"Of course, politically, that will be one of the questions. How much pressure will the United States put on Latin America to prevent this?\\" Details about the ideas Central American leaders will debate Saturday have not been released to the public. Perez Molina plans to present a range of proposals at the meeting, Guatemala's foreign minster said. Drug legalization is also expected to come up before a wider audience of regional leaders at next month's Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia. Rodriguez, the director of Plaza Publica, said Saturday's meeting will be a promising start to the debate, even if it takes years to hash out the details. \\"It wouldn't surprise me if in the next decade there would be a Latin American agreement to legalize drugs,\\" he said. But some analysts were more doubtful that other countries in the region would follow Perez Molina's lead. \\"Publicly, I would be very surprised if they stand behind this,\\" said Logan, of Southern Pulse. Jelsma said he hoped the leaders would weigh other drug policy changes, in addition to legalization. \\"I fear that this debate could lead into deadlock,\\" he said. \\"From the current situation, to jump to legalization as an answer to all these problems that are getting worse, I think it's a recipe for a debate that will get stuck pretty soon.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article talks about Otto Perez Molina, the President of Guatemala, who wants to legalize drugs in his country. He believes that legalizing drugs could help stop the bad things that happen because of drug-related violence. Some people agree with him, but others think it's not a good idea, like the United States. They believe that if drugs are legal, crime might increase. Leaders from Central American countries are going to talk about this idea to see if they want to make any changes. This is a big and important discussion, and it is not an easy decision to make."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How do I stop myself from overthinking and making scenarios in my head that are never going to happen and go to sleep easily? How can I make myself go to sleep without wearing myself out completely? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"To address your first question on how to stop yourself from overthinking and making scenarios in your head that are never going to happen and go to sleep easily, here are some step-by-step suggestions: 1. Create a calming bedtime routine: Establishing a routine before bed can signal to your brain that it's time to sleep. This might include activities such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. 2. Limit exposure to screens: Blue light emitted from devices like phones, tablets, and computers can disrupt your natural sleep cycle. Try to turn off these devices an hour before bed to help your brain transition to a sleep state. 3. Make your sleeping environment comfortable: Ensure that your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. You may also try using a white noise machine or earplugs to block out any disturbances. 4. Write down your thoughts: If your mind is racing with thoughts, try writing them down in a journal before bed. This can help alleviate the burden of overthinking and allow your mind to relax. 5. Set a regular sleep schedule: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day helps regulate your sleep cycle and can make falling asleep and waking up easier. 6. Limit caffeine and alcohol intake: Caffeine can have a long-lasting effect on your body that can disrupt sleep, while alcohol can interfere with your sleep quality. Limiting the intake of these substances, especially in the evening, can help improve your sleep. For your second question about how to make yourself go to sleep without wearing yourself out completely, here are some suggestions: 1. Prioritize relaxation: Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation before bedtime. 2. Get regular exercise: Engage in moderate aerobic exercise on a daily basis, but avoid exercising too close to bedtime, as it can sometimes make it harder to fall asleep. 3. Limit naps: Taking long naps during the day can disrupt your sleep at night. Limit naps to 20-30 minutes and avoid napping too close to bedtime. 4. Experiment with sleep aids: Some people find that herbal remedies like chamomile tea or melatonin supplements can help promote sleep. Speak with your doctor before trying any new sleep aids, especially if you take medication or have a medical condition. As for your final question, the two questions are similar and have some overlap, but they're not exactly the same. The first question focuses on stopping overthinking and making scenarios in your head, while the second question emphasizes making it easier to fall asleep without exhausting oneself. The suggested steps to address both concerns can help improve overall sleep quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Iron: Iron is an essential mineral for forming hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen throughout the body. It also has a role in energy production and maintaining a healthy immune system. 4. Magnesium: This mineral is vital for over 300 biochemical reactions in the body, including nerve and muscle function, maintaining a healthy immune system, and bone health. Magnesium also supports a steady heartbeat and helps regulate glucose levels. 5. Phosphorus: Phosphorus is crucial for the formation and maintenance of bones and teeth, energy production, and cell growth. It also plays a role in the proper functioning of the kidneys and the maintenance of acid-base balance in the body. Although minerals can be found in various forms, the soil remains the primary source of these essential nutrients. Some of the other options listed, such as bottles, countertops, pockets, stores, moles, sugar, and skin, might contain minerals but they are not a consistent, reliable, or direct source of essential nutrients required for body processes. For instance, minerals may be present in the bottles, store, and countertops as they contain water and food items, but soil remains their original source. Additionally, some minerals can be found in the body, such as in our pockets and skin tissues; however, these minerals are derived from sources connected with the earth's crust and are carried through the food we consume. In conclusion, the substances that are chemical elements essential for body processes can be found in soil, as it is the primary and most reliable source for these essential minerals. Minerals are vital for various body processes, and maintaining a healthy intake of these nutrients through a balanced diet ensures a well-functioning body and overall good health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Apple Photoshopped a NSFW joke out of its WWDC keynote During Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook offered to pay off a playful \\"ransom note\\" composed by members of the Cleveland Indians baseball team — a list that mostly consisted of demands for Apple products. But there was one NSFW item etched onto the original list that Apple had to Photoshop out before giving it stage time. For those who didn't watch the keynote live stream, here's the back story: When Major League Baseball player Brandon Moss, the first baseman for the Indians, recently earned his 100th home run, the ball landed in the team's bullpen. Rather than handing over his keepsake, his teammates grabbed it and wrote a ransom note for what they wanted in exchange. The requests ranged from iPhones and iPads to brand new MacBooks and an Apple Watch. Clearly, Cook was pleased with the wish list and said he'd be willing to make each request come true. While all the items seemed innocent enough, Twitter user Andrew Martin (first spotted by The Verge) was quick to point out that there was one clear omission when it was displayed behind Cook during the keynote: the request for a \\"50 gallon drum of lube.\\" Apple photoshopped #Windians ransom note, mod'ing Zep's request to be more family friendly. #wwdc15 pic.twitter.com/z5u2GjuB0T — Andrew Martin (@andrewcmartin) June 8, 2015 The demand came from Indians relief pitcher Marc Rzepcynski, known as \\"Zep,\\" who said he wanted a generous portion of lubricant in addition to an Apple Watch.

Burton was born to American parents at the U.S. Army Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in West Germany. His mother, Erma Gene (nee Christian), was a social worker, administrator, and educator. His father, Levardis Robert Martyn Burton, was a photographer for the U.S. Army Signal Corps at the time he was stationed at Landstuhl. Burton and his two sisters were raised by his mother in Sacramento, California. Burton was the host and executive producer of Reading Rainbow starting in 1983 for PBS. The series ran for 23 seasons, making it one of the longest-running children's programs on the network. The series garnered over 200 broadcast awards over its run, including a Peabody Award and 26 Emmy Awards, 11 of which were in the Outstanding Children's Series category. Burton himself won 12 Emmy awards as host and producer of the show.  After Reading Rainbow went off the air in 2006, Burton and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, acquired the global rights to the brand and formed RRKIDZ, a new media company for children. Reading Rainbow was reimagined as an all new application for the iPad in 2012, and was an immediate success, becoming the number-one educational application within 36 hours. At RRKIDZ, Burton serves as co-founder and curator-in-chief, ensuring that the projects produced under the banner meet the high expectations and trust of the Reading Rainbow brand.  On May 28, 2014, Burton and numerous coworkers from other past works started a Kickstarter campaign project to bring back Reading Rainbow. To keep with the changing formats to which young children are exposed, his efforts are being directed at making this new program web-based, following the success of the tablet application he helped create in recent years. His desire is to have the new Reading Rainbow be integrated into the classrooms of elementary schools across the country, and for schools in need to have free access. The Kickstarter campaign has since raised over 5 million, reaching triple its goal in only three days.

Text:  When particles move more quickly, temperature is higher and an object feels warmer. The answer is:","output":"The temperature of the particle increases when Rita makes it move very quickly. Based on the provided text, when particles move more quickly, the temperature is higher and an object feels warmer. In this scenario, Rita is increasing the speed of the particle, causing it to move rapidly. This increased movement of the particle corresponds to an increase in its kinetic energy. Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. Hence, as the particle's speed increases, so does its kinetic energy, resulting in a higher temperature. In conclusion, when Rita sees a particle and makes it move very quickly, the temperature of the particle increases due to the direct relationship between the speed of particle movement and temperature. This increased temperature results in a warmer sensation felt by the observer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The world's most popular Pinterest users are earning up to 250,000 a year, thanks to an increasing number of lucrative endorsements and brand collaborations arranged via a select group of Pinterest-focused talent agencies. According to Kyla Brennan, founder of HelloSociety, one of the top Pinterest agencies in the country, big name brands, including Kmart, Sephora and Kate Spade, are lining up to work with her clients - many of whom boast upwards of 1.8 million followers on the site. 'Pinterest is built for commerce,' the 29-year-old, whose Los Angeles-based agency pulled 12.5 million in revenue last year, told Re/Code. Under the Pinfluence: Pinterest's most popular users can make as much as 250,00 a year, according to Kyla Brennan, whose talent agency HelloSociety launched this board for Sephora's Formula X nail polishes. Indeed, some of the projects her clients have worked on have proved so successful for brands that they have diverted funds away from advertising on other social media platforms in order to invest more money in Pinterest which, as she points out, is ripe for retail partnerships given its catalogue-like setup. According to HelloSociety's website, previous projects completed by its pinners include creating recipes to promote major motion pictures, shooting editorial-style outfit inspiration for clothing lines, and coming up with crafts inspired by the spokeswoman for an auto insurance company. Fashion and beauty brands such as Kate Spade, Gap and Sephora have commissioned boards from HelloSociety's 350-plus pinners. Intelligent design: 'Pinterest is built for commerce,' said 29-year-old entrepreneur Ms Brennan (pictured) As opposed to sites like YouTube, where overnight celebrities are made through viral success, many of Pinterest's most followed users are simply those who were early adopters of the platform, and thus were recommended to new users. One would be hard-pressed to name a famous 'Pinfluencer', and Ms Brennan understands why the idea of one making a six-figure sum could raise skepticism. 'People hear Pinterest star and they’re like, \\"what?!\\",' she said. 'But after three years of doing this, seeing clients making hundreds of thousands of dollars and quit their jobs and pin full time, it’s real.' Pinterest star: Lauren Zwanziger, of Nashville, Tennessee, has close to five million followers, and is represented by HelloSociety. She adds that it’s much harder to get a huge audience in Pinterest than on other social networks, making Pinfluencers particularly valuable.

In late 1920, the Persian Soviet Socialist Republic in Rasht was preparing to march on Tehran with \\"a guerrilla force of 1,500 Jangalis, Kurds, Armenians and Azerbaijanis\\", reinforced by the Bolsheviks' Red Army. This fact, along with various other disorders, mutinies and unrest in the country created \\"an acute political crisis in the capital.\\" By 1921, the ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia had become corrupt and inefficient. The oil-rich nation was somewhat reliant on the nations of Britain and Russia for military and economic support. Civil wars earlier in the decade had threatened the government, and the only regular military force at the time was the Cossack Brigade. The Qajar shah in 1921 was Ahmad, who had been crowned at the age of eleven. He was considered to be a weak, incompetent ruler, especially after British, Russian and Ottoman occupations of Persia during World War I. In 1911, when the capital city, Tehran, had been seized by the Russians, armed Bakhtiaris tribemen, rather than Iranian regular troops, expelled the invaders. This further diminished the government's reputation, rendering it almost powerless in time of war. Britain, which played a major role in Persia, was dismayed by the Qajar government's inability to rule efficiently. This inefficiency was the background of a power struggle between Britain and Russia, each nation hoping to control Persia. On 14 January 1921, the British General Ironside chose to promote Reza Khan, who had been leading the Tabriz battalion, to lead the entire brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan's 3,000-4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade reached Tehran.

Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress.  Which person observed that the climate becomes colder at high elevations?  Hint: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. Answer:","output":"Jerry observed that the climate becomes colder at high elevations. He studies alpine climate, which is the average weather for the alpine tundra. As mentioned in the hint, the lapse rate of air causes the climate to get colder at higher elevations.

It is a toy that looks like a little rocket ship, and it can fly high up in the sky if we launch it just right. But how will we launch it? With our feet, of course! We will stomp on a litter bottle to make it go whoosh. So, what do we need? We need a stomp rocket and a launcher, and also a liter bottle. Make sure you get a grown-up's permission and help, as we need to take care of safety while playing. Let's start by preparing our rocket. We will use the launcher that comes with the rocket, and here is how we set it up: 1. Find a flat, open space outdoors, like a playground or your backyard. 2. Place the launcher on the ground, and make sure it is steady and secure. 3. Now, we are going to slide the rocket onto the launcher. Be gentle so that you don't break it. Make sure it fits snugly. Great job! Now that our rocket is ready on the launcher, let's get our liter bottle. Make sure the bottle is empty and that the cap is tightly closed. Here comes the fun part! We're going to stomp on the liter bottle to launch our rocket: 1. Stand next to the launcher, with the liter bottle in your hand. 2. Hold the bottle sideways, with the bottom facing the launcher. 3. Get ready to stomp! Make sure you have a good balance, and remember, safety first! 4. Using your foot, stomp down hard on the bottom of the bottle. Whoosh! Your rocket will now shoot up high into the sky. Watch how it soars and see how far it goes. Isn't it exciting? Remember, always play safely, and keep practicing your stomps. You'll become a stomp rocket expert in no time. Have fun with your rocket adventures!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jackson was the first Manx woman to win a Commonwealth Games medal, taking bronze in the 200m freestyle in 1970, and competed at the Mexico Olympics. Isle of Man Swimming manager Leonie Cooil said Atkinson's triumph is a \\"fantastic achievement which provides a real boost for Manx swimming\\". She added: \\"To be our first British champion for than half a century is a very special achievement.

Answer the following question: What institution was recommended by William Laver?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

(CNN) -- English club Chelsea have completed the signing of Oriol Romeu from Spanish and European champions Barcelona. The 19-year-old is currently playing for Spain at the World Under-20 Championships in Colombia and has signed a four-year deal with last season's Premier League runners-up. The deal is worth 7 million and includes a buy back clause, set at 14 million after the first year and 21 million after the second. Romeu started his career at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol before joining the Camp Nou academy in 2004. The midfielder, who can also play in central defence, made his debut for Barcelona in last season's Spanish Supercup match with Seville and got his first taste of league action against Deportivo in May 2010. He has played 90 minutes in both of Spain's games at the World Under-20 Championships, when they beat Costa Rica and Ecuador. Chelsea official web site confirmed the signing and said Romeu is \\"renowned for his strength and his expansive passing ability.\\" Another player leaving Barcelona is Jeffren Suarez after he agreed to join Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese outfit have paid 5 million for the 23-year-old which, like the Romeu deal, includes a buy back option.

One of the chimps escapes using the warfare tactics he was being trained for. Dr. Angelo is generally a pacifist, who would rather explore the intelligence-enhancing potential of his research without applying it for military purposes. His wife Caroline is unhappy with the way he is ignoring her to focus on this project. Jobe Smith, a local greenskeeper with an intellectual disability, lives in the garden shed owned by the local priest, Father Francis McKeen. McKeen's brother, Terry, is a local landscape gardener and employs Jobe to help him with odd jobs. Father McKeen punishes the challenged Jobe with a belt whenever he fails to complete his chores. Dr. Angelo realizes he needs a human subject to work with, and he spots Jobe mowing his lawn. Peter Parkette, Dr. Angelo's young neighbor, is friends with Jobe. Dr. Angelo invites both of them over to play some virtual reality games. Learning more about Jobe, Angelo persuades him to participate in his experiments, letting him know it will make him smarter. Jobe agrees and begins the program. Dr. Angelo makes it a point to redesign all the intelligence-boosting treatments without the \\"aggression factors\\" used in the chimpanzee experiments. Jobe soon becomes smarter, for example, learning Latin in only two hours. Meanwhile, Jobe also begins a sexual relationship with a young rich widow, Marnie. However, Jobe begins to display telepathic abilities and has hallucinations. He continues training at the lab, until an accident makes Dr. Angelo shut the program down.

Review: I recently had the incredible pleasure of dining at the Blue Rose Bistro, and I simply cannot rave enough about the superb experience this restaurant delivered. From the warm welcome we received upon entering to the outstanding service and, of course, the mouth-watering cuisine, Blue Rose Bistro truly exceeded all my expectations and won my heart over. Upon our arrival, despite being a busy Friday night, we were greeted warmly by the hostess who promptly escorted us to our reserved table. The ambiance of the restaurant struck the perfect balance between cozy and upscale, with dim romantic lighting, soothing tunes playing in the background, and tasteful decor that allowed the star of the evening - the food - to shine. Our attentive and accommodating server wasted no time in introducing herself and ensuring that our extensive dietary needs and preferences were taken into account. She showcased her knowledge of the menu and made exceptional recommendations that suited the diverse tastes in our party. The delightful culinary journey began with a complimentary amuse-bouche, a delectable surprise that perfectly teased our palates. The starter selection introduced us to the chef's remarkable skills, as each dish was impeccably balanced and burst with unique and daring flavor combinations. A notable standout was the heirloom tomato salad, accented with a refreshing mint-infused vinaigrette and topped with creamy burrata. The pièce de résistance was, without a doubt, the main courses. Blue Rose Bistro offers a vibrant selection of dishes that cater to all tastes, from the most carnivorous food lover to the most particular vegetarian. I savored every single bite of my pan-seared salmon, which was wonderfully tender and cooked to perfection, served on a bed of creamy risotto and adorned with a lip-smacking lemon caper sauce. My dining companions were equally blown away by their chosen dishes, raving about the succulent, perfectly seasoned lamb chops, and the innovative mushroom truffle gnocchi that left them scraping their plates clean. No culinary adventure is complete without a grand finale, and desserts at Blue Rose Bistro did not disappoint. Each dessert we ordered was a sumptuous treat - from the decadent chocolate lava cake to the tangy yet creamy lemon cheesecake, every bite was a clear testament to the pastry chef's expertise. To complement our meal, the extensive wine list provided a bevy of options to choose from, with a knowledgeable sommelier readily available to guide us in our decision-making. The wine we chose turned out to be an ideal accompaniment to our meal, and our glasses were attentively refilled throughout the evening. Needless to say, Blue Rose Bistro has left an indelible mark in my memory, and I cannot wait to return to indulge in their exceptional culinary offerings once again. A restaurant that seamlessly combines hospitality, atmosphere, and excellent cuisine deserves every bit of the praise, and I highly recommend Blue Rose Bistro to locals and visitors alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea.

In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself. Want to know how often the exercisers experienced “adverse events”? (Hint: often!) Wondering just what the structured exercise program involved? (Hint: more than walking!) Let’s dig into the details! At the end of this post, I’ll share my list of key take-home points for older adults and family caregivers. Who were the study volunteers? Whenever you read about a research study, it’s important to understand how the study volunteers compare to the older adults in *your* life. One of... Question: When the LIFE study was over, who walked better? Options: - neither group   - not enough information   - those in the exercise program   - those in the healthy education group === The correct answer is A:","output":"When the LIFE study was over, those in the exercise program walked better. This can be inferred from the results of the study, which showed that a structured exercise program was more effective than a healthy aging education program in avoiding \\"major mobility disability\\" among older adults. Specifically, the research found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. The encouraging finding in this study suggests that engaging in a structured exercise program can significantly improve the mobility and independence of older adults. Even though almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility (with half lasting 6 months or more), the results indicate that exercise can play a major role in reducing the risk and severity of mobility issues in the elderly population. This study's outcomes can be of great help not only to older adults but also to family caregivers and geriatricians who aim to improve the quality of life of the aging population. The LIFE study sheds light on the importance of exercise in maintaining and promoting mobility, independence, and overall health for older adults. In summary, the structured exercise program had a more positive impact on the mobility of the older adults in the study. Consequently, encouraging an older person to start exercising could be a worthwhile and essential effort in promoting their overall health, well-being, and independence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What is the name of the historical version of Christian liturgy that followed the Gallican Rite?\\" is in \\"Among the paleo-orthodox and emerging church movements in Protestant and evangelical churches, in which some Presbyterians are involved, clergy are moving away from the traditional black Geneva gown to such vestments as the alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite), which some, particularly those identifying with the Liturgical Renewal Movement, hold to be more ancient and representative of a more ecumenical past.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"Yes, based on the given text, it appears that the historical version of Christian liturgy that followed the Gallican Rite is the Old Gallican Rite, as it is mentioned in reference to the use of the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic. The Old Gallican Rite is an early and regionally diverse form of Christian liturgy that was used in Gaul, which is the region now known as modern-day France, Belgium, and parts of Germany. This rite coexisted with other liturgical rites, such as the Roman Rite and the Byzantine Rite, but it was eventually replaced and standardized under the influence of the Roman Rite within the Christian church. The Old Gallican Rite had its origins in the 5th century and was influenced by various regional and cultural traditions. It was characterized by its rich ceremonial practices and elaborate liturgical texts. As mentioned in the given text, some significant vestments associated with this rite include the Celtic alb, which resembled an ungirdled liturgical tunic, and the surplice, which was typically a full-length Old English style surplice. Within the context of the paleo-orthodox and emerging church movements, there is an interest in returning to these more ancient and diverse liturgical traditions as a way of reconnecting with the ecumenical past and broadening the understanding of Christian worship across different denominations. The Old Gallican Rite serves as an example of the rich heritage of early Christian liturgy that can inform and enhance contemporary worship practices, especially among Protestant and evangelical churches seeking to explore their historical roots and reexamine the liturgical expressions of their faith."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year. It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

The sky had been relatively clear all morning, but clouds had begun to roll in from the west, casting an uncertain light over what had been a bright and sunny day. As the weather forecast loaded on his phone, Sam pondered the importance of always being prepared for changes in climate, particularly in his region where sudden rainstorms were not uncommon. The app displayed a warning of scattered showers in the afternoon, followed by a 60% chance of more substantial rain later in the evening. Sam sighed, but he was not particularly surprised by the forecast. He knew the importance of keeping his belongings dry and his head protected from the elements, especially as he had a history of catching colds easily. He went to the closet, grabbed his umbrella, and placed it by the front door in preparation for his departure later that morning. While he only needed the umbrella if it was raining, Sam decided to bring his hat along as well. Although it might not serve the same purpose as the umbrella in terms of keeping him dry, he found that wearing a hat often helped in shielding him from the sometimes chilly winds that could arise just before a storm. He thought back to previous incidents when he had been caught unprepared in this kind of weather, shivering and miserable as the rain drenched him to his core. This time, however, Sam vowed that he would not allow Mother Nature to have her way with him so easily. As he donned his hat and tied a secure knot to keep the strap beneath his chin in place, Sam felt a renewed sense of determination. He would go about his day without the fear of inclement weather, confident in the protective measures he had taken. He glanced once more at his umbrella, standing tall and proud by the door, a symbol of his defiance against the unpredictable elements that had caused him so much discomfort in the past. With a satisfied nod, Sam turned away and went about finishing his morning routine, grateful for the foresight to check the weather and prepared for whatever the day had in store for him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

James Paul McCartney was born on 18 June 1942 in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary Patricia (nee Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James (\\"Jim\\") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II. McCartney has one younger brother named Michael. McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other bassists, including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC. Best known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle. He does not use slapping techniques. He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, whom McCartney called a hero for his melodic style. He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: \\"because he went to very unusual places\\". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke.  During McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a Hofner 500/1 bass, although from 1965, he favoured his Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, in contrast to the much lighter Hofner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Hofner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.  MacDonald identified \\"She's a Woman\\" as the turning point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out Rubber Soul as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on \\"The Word\\". Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's groove on the track \\"a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument.\\" MacDonald inferred the influence of James Brown's \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\\" and Wilson Pickett's \\"In the Midnight Hour\\", American soul tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he \\"delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date\\".  Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song \\"Rain\\" as \\"an astonishing piece of playing ... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass' ... [choosing] the area of the neck ... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove.\\" MacDonald identified the influence of Indian classical music in \\"exotic melismas in the bass part\\" on \\"Rain\\" and described the playing as \\"so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track\\". By contrast, he recognised McCartney's bass part on the Harrison-composed \\"Something\\" as creative but overly busy and \\"too fussily extemporised\\". McCartney identified Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\".  McCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' Hamburg days, when they often used Preludin to maintain their energy while performing for long periods. Bob Dylan introduced them to marijuana in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting \\"very high\\" and \\"giggling uncontrollably\\". His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics \\"another kind of mind\\" in \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\" specifically as a reference to cannabis. During the filming of Help!, McCartney occasionally smoked a joint in the car on the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused. Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and for about a year total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.  Initially reluctant to try LSD, McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second \\"acid trip\\" in March 1967, with Lennon, after a Sgt. Pepper studio session. He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, \\"It opened my eyes ... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society.\\" He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in The Times, which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.  In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney PS1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a PS100 fine. As a result of his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8 ounces (200 g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge. In 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him 200. Upon his return to England, he stated: \\"cannabis is ... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal ... I don't think ... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever.\\" In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: \\"People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong.\\" He did however, decide to quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren.  On 9 December 1980, McCartney followed the news that Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: \\"It's a drag\\". The press quickly criticised him for what appeared to be a superficial response. He later explained, \\"When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, \\"It's a drag\\".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make.\\" He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon:  I talked to Yoko the day after he was killed, and the first thing she said was, \\"John was really fond of you.\\" The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, \\"it's only me.\\" They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.  In 1983, McCartney said, \\"I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his \\"mask\\" and have a better relationship with him.\\" He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennon's death made the remaining ex-Beatles nervous that they might also be murdered. He told Mojo magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, \\"All Those Years Ago\\", which featured Starr on drums. McCartney released \\"Here Today\\" in 1982, a song Everett described as \\"a haunting tribute\\" to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.

Instead, a more appropriate and detailed answer would be: Throughout its history, Afghanistan has witnessed several conflicts and struggles for power. In particular, two empires that fought to control Afghanistan were the British Empire and the Russian Empire during a period known as The Great Game. The Great Game took place throughout the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century, representing the struggle for dominance over Central Asia. The British Empire, fearing the expansion of Russian influence toward the Indian subcontinent, wanted to maintain Afghanistan as a buffer zone between the two empires. They hoped that establishing a friendly government in Afghanistan would prevent Russian influence from seeping into British India. On the other hand, the Russian Empire sought to expand its territories and influence in Central Asia, which would bring them closer to British India, a prized colony for the British Empire. There were multiple wars fought as part of The Great Game. The First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–1842) saw the British invading Afghanistan in an attempt to establish a sympathetic government that could keep the Russians at bay. The war ended with British withdrawal, having failed to achieve their goals. The Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878-1880) saw another British invasion, only for them to later withdraw, but not before securing some control over Afghanistan's foreign affairs. The final conflict was the Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919), which resulted in Afghanistan gaining its independence from British influence and maintaining neutrality between the British and the Russians. Thus, the two empires that fought to control Afghanistan were the British Empire and the Russian Empire during the period known as The Great Game, primarily driven by the desire to establish dominance and influence over the region and to protect their respective territories."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: Have you ever had a cool image in your mind that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie: Like seeing a detective peeking through the cracks of a broken fence of some abandoned house? Or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and awfully alert? Yeah. Imagine stretching that image to a whole movie, you pretty much got the idea of Broken, though there's no detectives in this movie, I'm just using it as a visual example. But, the intense looking woman is here and she filled pretty much 99% of the screen time. I got nothing to complain about that woman, she's a perfect choice for this role. I consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and I can truly enjoy some really moody stuff. It would be really cool if I can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall. Let's be honest here, the acting is superb. Some of the expressions on the actors face are what keep me watching. Now onto the problem of this movie. Beyond the mood, there's not much anything else here. The director basically took an obsession of an idea and ran it far beyond what it was worth. I don't consider it to be a spoiler if I say the obsession is \\"mirror\\". Let's face it, this singular idea is all over the bloody place and that's all the director got to work with. Granted, there are a few twist and turn here and there. If you paid any attention, nothing is going to surprise you in the end, obvious plot holes aside. Now, I'm not picking bones with this style of art since I enjoyed them most of the time. I still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express. Movie is not a piece of music, or a picture, or a painting, or even a poem, and certainly not just a cool image in your mind. It's all that plus a good story and character development. I consider the Lynch style of movie making cheating. It is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium. We gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason. Therefore, we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a painting. This movie is not completely Lynch style, thank goodness. It has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion. It does not have much story or character development. It presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks, thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface. It does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element nor did it ever attempt to build a coherent world around it. The oddity came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental. Maybe the coherency remains in director's head but from what I can see he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screen. Where did he put his effort in then? It seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and enhancing it with the music. The music often built up tension which eventually turn into a tease. Only in the later part of the movie the scare and tension materialized. In the end, I felt like: OK, I know what you are trying to say here but is that the point you are trying to make by spending two hours building up all these tension? It is rather irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have. And we are given very little about who the characters are. All we have is this circumstance that just took placed. Disappointing but I guess the director did not have much material to work with and it shows. What is the sentiment of this review?

Step 1: Analyze Action A Saying no to going to formal with someone could potentially hurt someone's feelings, but it also allows an individual to set boundaries and make choices based on their comfort level. It's important to be honest about one's feelings and preferences rather than attending an event out of obligation. Step 2: Analyze Action B Not wanting to room with a friend might also hurt their feelings, but it can also be an important decision for personal comfort and maintaining a friendship. Living with someone can be challenging, and if someone feels that they aren't well-suited for living together, it might be better for the friendship to remain separate in terms of living arrangements. Step 3: Compare Actions Both actions may cause some emotional distress, but saying no to going to formal with someone (A) is a single, specific event, while not wanting to room with a friend (B) can have a longer-lasting impact on daily life and relationships.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"its hit with neutrons\\" happens, how will it affect MORE radioactive decay occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If an unstable isotope is hit with neutrons, it can lead to more radioactive decay occurring depending on the reaction that takes place upon being hit with neutrons. 1. Neutron capture: If the unstable isotope captures the neutron, it will increase the number of neutrons in its nucleus. Depending on the isotope in question, neutron capture can sometimes cause the unstable isotope to become more unstable or even stable. If the resulting isotope after neutron capture is more unstable, this will indirectly lead to more radioactive decay. 2. Neutron-induced fission: In some cases, particularly for heavy and highly unstable isotopes (e.g., Uranium-235), the interaction with a neutron can cause the nucleus to split into smaller nuclei through a process known as fission. This process will directly increase the radioactive decay, as the fission process releases energy in the form of radiation and produces smaller, unstable daughter isotopes. In conclusion, the perturbation of being hit with neutrons can have a direct or indirect effect on the radioactive decay process depending on the reaction that occurs when the neutron interacts with the unstable isotope. This effect could lead to more radioactive decay, less decay, or even stabilization of the isotope.

I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human. Question: who stuck the needle in the boy's arm? Options: - the boy himself   - the boy's mom   - not enough information   - Doctor Brandenbury === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"Doctor Brandenbury"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But last summer, when blackouts struck much of the northeastern US, Ontario and Rome, consumers on two continents were given a painful reminder of just how easily broken electricity supplies can be. The massive disorder stranded  commuters, stopped freezers, shut down businesses and refocused attention on where most of the planet's power comes from:oil-and-gas-fired generators and nuclear plants, These sources not only pollute the environment but also make many consumers feel unacceptable health risks. Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity. With the cell phone and gadget market in mind, Medis has developed a fuel cell with cheap components that produces little heat and effortlessly reduces waste water without turning to energy consuming pumps. The answer to this question is:","output":"What was one of the main goals of innovators in the search for alternative energy sources in the article? A) To create more oil and gas-fired generators B) To make clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity C) To focus solely on nuclear power plants D) To increase the usage of local grids"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

War of words continues in Trayvon Martin case Key Trayvon Martin evidence enhanced \\"AC360°\\" teams up with a child psychologist to see what factors contribute to children's opinions on race. Could these same factors have shaped how you view race? The special report, \\"Kids on Race: The Hidden Truth,\\" continues Wednesday on CNN at 8 p.m. ET. Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- Supporters of slain teen Trayvon Martin and his acknowledged killer continued Tuesday to battle over the significance of evidence in the case. A Martin family attorney insisted Tuesday that the former prosecutor in the case met with the now sidelined police chief to discuss the case hours after Martin died, overruling a police detective who the family says prepared an affidavit urging that neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman be arrested. Meanwhile, a friend of Zimmerman's told CNN that video of the neighborhood watch volunteer in police custody does seem to show injuries consistent with Zimmerman's report that Martin slammed his head to the concrete after the two exchanged words. FBI agents were in Sanford on Tuesday, continuing their interviews in a civil rights investigation of the case, which Martin family supporters say is a clear-cut case of racial profiling leading to an unjust killing. One of the people they met with Tuesday is Frank Taaffe, Zimmerman's neighbor and friend. On Monday, agents interviewed Martin's girlfriend, the 16-year-old girl who, phone records show, was on the line with him shortly before the fatal confrontation, Martin family attorney Daryl Parks confirmed Tuesday. Special prosecutor Angela Corey's investigation also continued. Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, profiled Martin, who was black, as \\"suspicious\\" and ignored a police dispatcher's request that he not follow him. Martin had a bag of Skittles and an iced tea at the time of his death. The 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer has said he killed the unarmed 17-year-old in self-defense, saying the teen punched him and slammed his head into a sidewalk before the shooting, according to family members and police. Rallies nationwide have called for Zimmerman's arrest, decrying the Sanford Police Department's handling of the case. Zimmerman's legal adviser, Craig Sonner, said on Tuesday that criminal defense lawyer Hal Uhrig would represent Zimmerman and that Sonner would serve as co-counsel if the case were to proceed. Uhrig spent more than six years with the Gainesville Police Department in Florida before graduating from law school in 1974. In an interview with WOFL-TV in Orlando, both lawyers said they had communicated with Zimmerman only by telephone. Sonner said Zimmerman, who has not appeared publicly since the shooting, was concerned about \\"people who will do him harm.\\" On Tuesday, Martin family attorney Jasmine Rand insisted again that the former prosecutor in the case, State Attorney Norm Wolfinger, met with the now sidelined Sanford police chief on the night of the killing and overruled a police detective urging that Zimmerman be arrested. In a letter delivered Monday to the U.S. Justice Department, the Martin family said the Sanford police detective \\"filed an affidavit stating that he did not find Zimmerman's statements credible in light of the circumstances and facts surrounding the shooting.\\" The Martin family said Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee and State Attorney Norm Wolfinger met the night of the shooting and disregarded the detective's advice, allowing Zimmerman to remain free. ABC News has reported that the lead homicide investigator, Chris Serino, filed an affidavit pushing for charges the night of the killing, but was overruled by the state attorney's office. Neither Sanford police nor prosecutors have confirmed the existence of such an affidavit. Sanford officials and special prosecutor Corey's office declined to comment. On Tuesday, Rand said she had not seen a copy of the affidavit, but said she believed several news organizations had. But Wolfinger, who stepped aside in the case last month, vehemently denied that any \\"such meeting or communication occurred\\" between him and Lee. \\"I am outraged by the outright lies contained in the letter by Benjamin Crump,\\" a Martin family attorney, Wolfinger said in a statement Monday. \\"I have been encouraging those spreading the irresponsible rhetoric to stop and allow State Attorney Angela Corey to complete her work,\\" he said. \\"Another falsehood distributed to the media does nothing to forward that process.\\" Rand said the family's legal team has multiple, credible sources who say Wolfinger and Lee met that night. She declined to elaborate. The two sides also argued Tuesday over surveillance video showing Zimmerman in police custody after the shooting. An enhanced copy of the video appears to show a bump, mark or injury on Zimmerman's head more clearly than does another copy of the video previously reviewed by CNN. That video had a grainy quality. While the video does not appear to show major wounds, Taaffe, Zimmerman's neighbor and friend, said Seminole County paramedics cared for Zimmerman before they released him to police. \\"That's why you don't see him like he came out of a 12-round fight like Rocky Balboa against Apollo Creed,\\" Taaffe said. But Rand, the Martin family attorney, said Tuesday that it doesn't matter what the videotape shows. \\"That does not change our position,\\" she said. \\"Once again, George Zimmerman was the aggressor. He pursued Trayvon in this instance. If he did have any medical injuries, that did not give him the right to use deadly force and shoot and kill Trayvon.\\" Also Tuesday, Taaffe told CNN that the neighborhood had experienced a spate of burglaries over 15 months, which he said were committed by black men. But Taaffe said Zimmerman was not a racist. \\"Young black men were never the topic of discussion,\\" he said. It was that neighborhood homes had been repeatedly burglarized, he said. Police records didn't appear to support Taaffe's assertion, describing four incidents involving black men. Taaffe declined further comment to CNN. The continued discussion over recorded evidence carried over from Monday, when a major point of debate was a 911 call placed on the night Martin was killed. Zimmerman has said he was yelling for help, according to his family members and his account to authorities, as first reported by the Orlando Sentinel and later confirmed by Sanford police. But Martin's relatives, including his cousin Ronquavis Fulton, have said they are certain the voice heard on the 911 call is Trayvon Martin's. Audio experts Tom Owen and Ed Primeau, who analyzed the recordings for the Sentinel using different techniques, said they don't believe it is Zimmerman who is heard yelling in the background of one 911 call. They compared the screams with Zimmerman's voice, as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier describing a \\"suspicious\\" black male. \\"There's a huge chance that this is not Zimmerman's voice,\\" said Primeau, a longtime audio engineer who is listed as an expert in recorded evidence by the American College of Forensic Examiners International. \\"After 28 years of doing this, I would put my reputation on the line and say this is not George Zimmerman screaming.\\" Owen, a forensic audio analyst and chairman emeritus of the American Board of Recorded Evidence, also said he does not believe the screams came from Zimmerman. He cited software that is widely used in Europe and has become recently accepted in the United States that examines characteristics like pitch and the space between spoken words to analyze voices. Using it, he found a 48% likelihood the voice is Zimmerman's. At least 60% is necessary to feel confident two samples are from the same source, he told CNN on Monday -- meaning it's unlikely it was Zimmerman who can be heard yelling. The experts, both of whom said they have testified in cases involving audio analysis, stressed they cannot say who was screaming. But CNN and HLN legal analysts Beth Karas and Sonny Hostin raised questions about what the public should consider regarding the conclusions reached. Hostin said several questions and variables must be considered, including the fact the tests did not analyze similar speech. That is, the analysis was based on screams heard from a distance in a 911 call, compared with a direct phone conversation Zimmerman had with a 911 operator. \\"Ideally, you want (Zimmerman or Martin's) voice saying the same exact thing, screaming 'Help!' in order to analyze it,\\" she said. Would these tests be admissible in court and considered evidence? \\"It really depends on the individual judge,\\" Hostin said. \\"In Florida, they are going to conduct a Frye test, the legal test, which asks if the science is generally accepted in the community.\\" Karas questioned whether the test stood up to the voice-comparison standards of the American Board of Recorded Evidence. The standards indicate that, when analyzing speech, there should be a minimum of at least 10 words to be compared with each other in order to say you can have a \\"possible elimination\\" conclusion. But in this case, the cries for help don't have nearly that number of words. Owen said the published American Board of Recorded Evidence standards apply only partially to the kind of test he conducted. \\"These standards apply to the older aural-spectrographic analysis and software,\\" Owen said. \\"This only partially applies to the biometric software.\\" Both Karas and Hostin urged caution in reaching any conclusions about the findings of Primeau and Owen. \\"I do think we need to take a step back, as with most of the facts in this case, and look at it the way the court would,\\" Hostin said. \\"And that is by asking if the circumstances of how, and if, the test was done, OK, and wait to determine whether it's reliable.\\" The ongoing friction from the incident has continued to divide Sanford and the country. But Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett said Tuesday he senses that people in his community are ready to start trying to move on. \\"I think there's a big portion of the city that are trying to get to the healing mode,\\" he said.

How is \\"Threading Model\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the term \\"Threading Model\\" can be translated as \\"Vláknový Model\\". It's essential to understand the concept and application of threading models in computing and software development. A vláknový model (threading model) is a concept that refers to the management and utilization of multiple threads within a software application or process. Threads are the smallest unit of execution within a program, and they describe how tasks are divided and managed by the operating system or software. Threading models are critical components in any programming language or platform, as they determine how concurrent operations will be performed and managed effectively. There are several types of threading models used in various programming languages and platforms. Some of the most common ones include: 1. Jednovláknový model (single-threaded model): In this model, the application or process is executed linearly, with only one thread running at a time. This is the most straightforward approach to managing execution flow, but it can lead to performance issues, especially when dealing with tasks that require waiting for external resources, such as input/output operations or network communication. 2. Vícevláknový model (multi-threaded model): In this model, multiple threads run concurrently, allowing tasks to be processed in parallel. It helps improve the performance and responsiveness of an application, as threads can work on tasks independently and continue processing even when one of the threads has to wait for an external interaction. This can make the application more efficient, but it may also require more advanced synchronization and communication mechanisms between threads, such as mutexes, locks, or semaphores. 3. Paralelní model (parallel model): This model is a more advanced variation of the multi-threaded model, specifically designed for high-performance computing and optimization on modern hardware systems with multiple CPU cores or processors. It involves running multiple threads in parallel and effectively managing resources like CPU cores and memory to minimize potential bottlenecks or conflicts. 4. Asynchronní model (asynchronous model): This threading model focuses on performing tasks without blocking the execution of other tasks or threads. In an asynchronous model, multiple tasks run in parallel, and synchronization mechanisms like callbacks, promises, or event-driven systems are used to handle tasks' completion or communication between them. It helps improve the responsiveness and overall performance of an application, especially when dealing with time-consuming operations such as network communication or user interactions. Understanding and applying the appropriate threading model in Czech (vláknový model) is essential for developing efficient, scalable, and reliable software applications that can perform well on different hardware and operating systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

EasyGroup was founded by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, a British-Cypriot entrepreneur, in 1998. The brand is known for its distinct orange hue and simplified business models, targeting budget-conscious consumers. 1. easyJet: Launched in 1995, easyJet is now one of Europe's leading low-cost airlines. Serving over 150 destinations across Europe, the Middle East, and Northern Africa, easyJet's primary focus is to provide affordable air travel for the masses. EasyJet operates using a no-frills business model, with passengers paying extra fees for checked luggage, seat selection, and in-flight food and beverages. This cost-effective approach allows easyJet to maintain competitive prices while ensuring operational efficiency. 2. easyInternetcafe: First opened in London in 1999, at the peak of the internet cafe boom, easyInternetcafe was Europe's largest chain of internet cafes. EasyInternetcafe offered affordable internet access, charging customers on a per-minute basis. With the advent and widespread adoption of smartphones, easyInternetcafe has declined in popularity, but it remains an example of the brand's innovative approach to providing accessible technology for the masses. 3. easyCinema: Launched in 2003, easyCinema aimed to revolutionize the theater-going experience by adopting a dynamic pricing model, where tickets were cheaper earlier in the day and more expensive closer to the showtime. This business model aimed to attract price-sensitive consumers to watch movies during off-peak times. However, the idea struggled to gain traction and faced resistance from film distributors, leading to the closure of easyCinema's flagship location in 2006. 4. easyBus: Established in 2004, easyBus is a low-cost, airport transfer bus service primarily operating in London. It offers regular transfer services between several key airports and central London, providing an affordable and convenient transportation option for budget-conscious travelers. EasyBus is particularly popular among users of the easyJet airline, as it complements the airline's goal of affordable air travel. 5. easyPizza: Founded in 2004, easyPizza was an online pizza delivery service targeting budget-conscious consumers. Pizzas were available at significantly lower prices compared to competitors, with customers pre-booking delivery time slots. However, due to operational challenges and limited public acceptance, the venture was short-lived, with easyPizza changing its name to easyFoodstore and shifting focus to selling low-cost, non-perishable groceries in 2016. 6. easyCar: Launched in 2000, easyCar is a car rental service with a focus on low-cost pricing and a streamlined booking system. With convenient pickup and drop-off locations across various destinations, easyCar makes car rental options more accessible for price-conscious travelers. 7. easy4Men: Introduced in 2001, easy4Men was a budget retail venture that aimed to sell men's toiletries and grooming products at discounted prices. However, like some other EasyGroup ventures, it failed to gain widespread popularity and eventually closed. EasyGroup's businesses are united under a common goal of making products and services more accessible for consumers through simplified business models, low-cost pricing, and innovative solutions. While not all ventures have been successful, the company's impact on various industries, particularly the travel sector, has been significant. By constantly adapting and addressing market needs, EasyGroup remains at the forefront of innovation in making essential services more affordable for people across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? it 's a thin notion","output":"To determine the sentiment of the movie review sentence, \\"it's a thin notion,\\" we must first understand the meaning conveyed by the author and its context within the overall review. However, given this single sentence, we will analyze and interpret it as thoroughly as possible. The phrase \\"thin notion\\" suggests that the movie concept is not complex, lacks depth, or is superficial. In general, movie reviews use such expressions to describe a poorly constructed or uninspired story premise. The author's choice of the word \\"thin\\" implies that they might find the idea weak, as opposed to \\"thick\\" or \\"rich,\\" which would denote a stronger, more engaging concept. Considering the given context, the sentiment of this sentence appears to be negative. However, it is essential to note that this analysis is based solely on this single sentence. The sentiment might be different when the entire review is read, as it could offer a more balanced assessment of the movie or further context on the author's perspective. In conclusion, based on the given sentence, \\"it's a thin notion,\\" the sentiment leans towards negative, as it conveys that the movie has a weak, superficial, or underdeveloped concept.

Is At their outset in the early 1970s, Queen's music has been characterised as \\"Led Zeppelin meets Yes\\" due to its combination of \\"acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics\\". a good answer to this question?","output":"While the statement \\"Led Zeppelin meets Yes\\" provides an insight into Queen's musical influences and style, it does not specifically answer the question about which guitarist inspired Queen. A more detailed and long response is needed to address the question properly.  It is essential to note that Queen is comprised of various members, each with their individual musical influences and tastes, which all contributed to the band's unique sound. In the context of Queen's formation and the guitarist who may have inspired the group, it is crucial to focus on Queen's lead guitarist, Brian May. Brian May, born on July 19, 1947, in Hampton, London, was a significant driving force in Queen's distinct sound and an innovative guitarist in his own right. His influences and sources of inspiration were varied and included musicians from both the blues and rock genres. One of the most important guitarists that had a considerable impact on Brian May's playing style and sound was Jimi Hendrix. Brian May has highlighted Hendrix's influence on him several times over the years. He admired Hendrix's musical abilities, innovative use of feedback and distortion, and the emotion he was able to express through his guitar playing.  Another prominent guitarist who likely had an impact on both May's guitar style and the band's overall sound was Eric Clapton. Clapton's work with the bands Cream, and Derek and the Dominos showcased disciplined soloing and remarkable vibrato, qualities May later adopted into his own playing. Also, British guitarist Jeff Beck had a profound influence on May, as he expressed in several interviews. Beck's experimentation with guitar sounds, his impressive technical abilities, and versatility have long been a source of inspiration for May. Lastly, we cannot overlook May's inspiration from other bands and guitarists that emerged during the 1960s and early 1970s. Queen's sound indeed combines the hard-rocking, blues-infused elements of bands like Led Zeppelin with the progressive, symphonic sensibilities of groups like Yes. Consequently, guitarists like Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin and Steve Howe from Yes would have also played a role in shaping Queen's guitar sound. In summary, Queen's music was undoubtedly inspired by several guitarists and bands from the 1960s and early 1970s. The lead guitarist, Brian May, has mentioned multiple influences in his playing, including Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and other guitarists from contemporary groups like Led Zeppelin and Yes. The combination of these various influences formed the foundation for Queen's unique, iconic sound that remains celebrated to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released  the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation.

Q:Information:  - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude.  - Slapstick is a style of humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of normal physical comedy. The term arises from a device developed during the broad, physical comedy style known as Commedia dell'arte in 16th Century Italy. The 'slap stick' consists of two thin slats of wood made from splitting a single long stick, which make a 'slap' when striking another actor, with little force needed to make a loud - and comical - sound.  - Etiology (alternatively aetiology or ætiology) is the study of causation, or origination. The word is derived from the Greek , \\"aitiologia\\", \\"giving a reason for\\" (\\"aitia\\", \\"cause\\"; and , \\"-logia\\"). The word is most commonly used in medical and philosophical theories, where it is used to refer to the study of why things occur, or even the reasons behind the way that things act, and is used in philosophy, physics, psychology, government, geography, spatial analysis, medicine, theology, and biology in reference to the causes of various phenomena.  - Premature ejaculation (PE) occurs when a man experiences orgasm and expels semen soon after sexual activity and with minimal penile stimulation.

The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show.  - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics.

It was directed by Reginald Hudlin . The movie focuses on the exploits of radio host and sex therapy expert Leon Phelps .  - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - Sex therapy is a strategy for the treatment of sexual dysfunction when there is no medical etiology (physiological reason) or as a complement to medical treatment. The sexual dysfunctions which may be addressed by sex therapy include non-consummation, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, low libido, unwanted sexual fetishes, sexual addiction, painful sex, or a lack of sexual confidence, assisting people who are recovering from sexual assault, problems commonly caused by stress, tiredness, and other environmental and relationship factors. Sex therapists assist those experiencing problems in overcoming them, in doing so possibly regaining an active sex life.  - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast.

He knew the young aristocrat could swim. Moreover, the end of the rowboat was within easy reach.  Percy let out one yell, and then went under. The yell was not one of fright over his safety, but over the thought that all of his elegant clothing would be wet through and through.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with.

A basic chronograph has an independent sweep second hand; it can be started, stopped, and returned to zero by successive pressure on the stem. Less simple chronographs use additional complications and can have multiple independent hands to measure seconds, minutes, hours and even tenths of a second. In addition, many modern chronographs use moveable bezels as tachymeters for rapid calculations of speed or distance. Louis Moinet invented the chronograph in 1816 for use in tracking astronomical objects. Chronographs were also used heavily in artillery fire in the mid to late 1800s. More modern uses of chronographs involve piloting airplanes, car racing, diving and submarine maneuvering.  - The city of Bern or Berne (; Bernese German: \\"Bärn\\" ) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their (e.g. in German) \\"Bundesstadt,\\" or \\"federal city\\".

It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 metres (just over 13,000 feet).  - Louis Moinet (1768 - 1853), inventor of the chronograph, was born into a prosperous family of farmers in Bourges, France, was a French horologist, sculptor and painter.  - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.

Article: One potential problem with allowances is that children's responsible behavior can become about earning the allowance rather than the intrinsic value of their family responsibilities. For example, if you pay your children for taking out the rubbish, they see this chore   as a job that they should be rewarded for instead of a responsibility they must fulfill as part of the family. But giving children an allowance for weekly chores is not necessarily bad. You are rewarding them for fulfilling their family responsibilities, but it is not for a specific act. It is an appreciation of their commitment to your family values. You are also conveying another important message that their actions have consequences: if they do good things, good things happen. They also learn a lesson about the market economy, namely that work is rewarded. Allowances can also be used as punishment and to teach children lessons about family values. For example, if your children join a group of kids smashing   pumpkins on Halloween, a part of a reasonable punishment might be to require them to pay the families out of their allowance to replace the pumpkins. Thus, your children learn that bad behavior has financial consequences. Meanwhile, by relating the punishment to the misdeed, you ensure that your children see the connection and learn the value lesson. How much allowance should you pay your children? The precise amount depends on your family's financial situation, the cost of living and your children's needs. Children can start to earn a weekly allowance as early as 5 years of age. An increase of  1 per week for each year of your children's lives is realistic until they reach their mid-teens. When they begin to drive and date, you can calculate their expenses and establish a reasonable allowance that covers their needs. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that  _  .

Title: The Exorcist III Movie plot: The film begins with the point of view of someone wandering through the streets of Georgetown, a voice informing us \\"I have dreams... of a rose... and of falling down a long flight of stairs.\\" The point of view shows a warning of evil about to arrive later that night at a church. Demonic growls are heard. Leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a crucifix comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman at a crime scene, where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered. Kinderman takes his friend, a priest named Father Dyer, out to see their mutually favorite film It's a Wonderful Life. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes placeâa priest is found decapitated in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalizedâand found murdered the next dayâwith the words \\"IT'S A WONDERFULL LIFE\\" [sic] written on a wall in Dyer's blood. The fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match, indicating a different person was responsible for each. Kinderman tells hospital staff the reason for his unease: fifteen years ago the vicious serial killer James \\"The Gemini\\" Venamun, was executed; with every victim he cut off the right index finger and carved the Zodiac sign of Gemini into the palm of their left hand. Kinderman noticed the hands of the three new victims and verified that the Gemini's sign has been there. The Gemini Killer also always used an extra \\"L\\" in his notes sent to the media, such as \\"usefull\\" or \\"carefull\\". Furthermore, to filter out false confessions, the original Gemini Killer's true mutilations were kept a secret by the Richmond police's homicide department; the newspapers were made to wrongfully report that the left middle finger was severed and that the Gemini sign was carved on the back of the victim.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"No, the hypothesis (\\"She is paid\\") is not entailed by the premise (\\"If she's not paid, she's an intern\\"). To understand why, let's break down the information provided by the premise and analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. The premise is a conditional statement, presenting information in an \\"if-then\\" format. It consists of two parts: the antecedent and the consequent. 1. Antecedent: \\"she's not paid\\" 2. Consequent: \\"she's an intern\\" The premise informs us that if a condition is met (i.e., not being paid), then a particular outcome will follow (i.e., becoming an intern). In other words, the premise is stating that not being paid is a sufficient condition for someone to be considered an intern. However, it does not offer any information on the opposite situation - whether an intern can also be paid or if a paid individual can be considered an intern. Now let's examine the hypothesis, which states that \\"she is paid.\\" This information is not directly addressed by the premise. It's important to note that the premise doesn't claim that \\"if she's paid, she's not an intern\\" or provide any information about what it means when someone is paid. Therefore, based on the provided premise alone, we cannot draw any concrete conclusions about the hypothesis. Thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, because the premise does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the hypothesis is true or false."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers?, using the article: Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross.

He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who served as Thomaskantor? ?  Johann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! (Ring out, you songs; sound, you strings!), BWV 172, in Weimar for Pentecost Sunday in 1714. Bach led the first performance on 20 May 1714 in the Schlosskirche, the court chapel in the ducal Schloss. Erschallet, ihr Lieder is an early work in a genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. Bach was appointed Konzertmeister in Weimar in the spring of 1714, a position that called for the performance of a church cantata each month. He composed Erschallet, ihr Lieder as the third cantata in the series, to a text probably written by court poet Salomon Franck. The text reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit. The librettist included a quotation from the day's prescribed Gospel reading in the only recitative, and for the closing chorale he used a stanza from Philipp Nicolai's hymn \\"Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern\\" (1599). The work is in six movements, and scored for four vocal soloists, four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, oboe, bassoon and a string orchestra of two violins, two violas, and basso continuo. The orchestra for the holiday occasion is festive compared to the two works previously composed in Weimar. The cantata opens with a chorus, followed by the recitative, in which words spoken by Jesus are sung by the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ). A bass aria with trumpets addresses the Trinity, and a tenor aria then describes the Spirit that was present at the Creation. This is followed by an intimate duet of the Soul (soprano) and the Spirit (alto), to which an oboe plays the ornamented melody of Martin Luther's hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\" and a solo cello provides the bass line. The theme of intimacy between God and Man is developed further in the following chorale, after which Bach specified an unusual repeat of the opening chorus.

The Luftwaffe dropped around 45,000 short tons (41,000 t) of bombs during the Blitz disrupting production and transport, reducing food supplies and shaking the British morale. It also helped to support the U-Boat blockade by sinking some 58,000 long tons (59,000 t) of shipping destroyed and 450,000 long tons (460,000 t) damaged. Yet, overall the British production rose steadily throughout this period although there were significant falls during April 1941, probably influenced by the departure of workers of Easter Holidays according to the British official history. The British official history on war production noted the great impact was upon the supply of components rather than complete equipment. In aircraft production, the British were denied the opportunity to reach the planned target of 2,500 aircraft in a month, arguably the greatest achievement of the bombing, as it forced the dispersal of industry. In April 1941, when the targets were British ports, rifle production fell by 25%, filled-shell production by 4.6%, and in smallarms production 4.5% overall. The strategic impact on industrial cities was varied; most took from 10–15 days to recover from heavy raids, although Belfast and Liverpool took longer. The attacks against Birmingham took war industries some three months to recover fully from. The exhausted population took three weeks to overcome the effects of an attack.

Let's break down the sentences to better understand the reasoning behind this conclusion. Sentence 1: \\"Ca'daan spent most of the afternoon thinking about what the Kal had said.\\" This sentence is telling us that there was a period of time (most of the afternoon) during which Ca'daan was occupied with reflecting on something that the Kal had said. The key information here is that the Kal had spoken and communicated some information, thought, or idea, and Ca'daan was pondering it. The main focus of this sentence is on Ca'daan's mental activity and the duration of it; however, it is directly reliant on the fact that the Kal had said something. Sentence 2: \\"The Kal had said something to Ca'daan.\\" This sentence is more direct in addressing the fact that the Kal had communicated something to Ca'daan. The main focus of this sentence is the act of the Kal saying something, which is the basis for the first sentence. When we compare these two sentences, it is clear that the truth of the first sentence depends on the truth of the second sentence. Both sentences establish that the Kal had said something to Ca'daan, but they emphasize different aspects of the situation. Sentence 1 conveys the effect of the Kal's words on Ca'daan—that is, how Ca'daan spends the afternoon in response to what was said. Sentence 2 directly states the fact that the Kal had said something to Ca'daan. In conclusion, if we assume that the first sentence is true, then we have to accept that the Kal had said something to Ca'daan, which is the core information in the second sentence. Therefore, the second sentence is true as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The difference in the sound quality between the two instruments was apparent to the audience, creating an uneasy atmosphere. Meanwhile, the discordant notes from the violin detracted from the overall harmonious ambience that the musical ensemble was attempting to create. The cello, on the other hand, maintained a rich and resonant tone throughout the performance. The deep, sonorous notes produced by the cello seemed to envelop the room, captivating those in attendance and showcasing the impressive acoustics of the concert hall. The violinist, upon realizing that their instrument was out of tune, tried to compensate by adjusting their playing technique and attempting to blend in with the rest of the ensemble. However, this only highlighted the issue further, drawing more attention to the out-of-tune tones and creating an imbalance within the group. As the concert continued, it became clear that the violin's tuning problem was affecting the overall audio experience for the audience. A few people in the crowd started to whisper and murmur, discussing the issue among themselves. Some even began to look around to see if anyone else was noticing the discordant sounds that stood out against the otherwise harmonious backdrop of the music. The violinist's struggle and frustration with their instrument were palpable. Sweat was visible on their brow, and their facial expressions conveyed the stress of trying to salvage the performance. The rest of the musicians, aware of the glaring issue, tried their best to support their colleague and carry the music forward despite the imperfections. Unfortunately, as the concert progressed, the diversion from the ideal sound landscape became too glaring to overlook. The feeling of discomfort rippled through the audience, and the silent judgment began to emerge through the glances exchanged between attendees. Though the other musicians in the ensemble were masterfully delivering their respective parts, it was not enough to fully divert the focus from the out of tune violin. During the intermission, the violinist was seen backstage hurriedly attempting to correct the issue. Fellow musicians and stagehands lent their support, offering guidance and assisting with the tuning process. The anxiety was visible, as everyone knew the collective performance and impression of the ensemble was on the line. When the performance resumed, the violin had been tuned more accurately, and it was now in harmony with the rest of the ensemble. The musicians' synchronized efforts began to produce the intended audio experience, and the audience's focus returned to the skill and passion embodied in the performance. The cello continued to maintain its rich and profound tone, complementing the now melodic violin. As the concert came to a close, the initial discord had been mostly forgotten, and the powerful music swept the listeners away with its beauty and intensity. However, the memory of the out-of-tune violin during the first half of the concert lingered as a reminder of the delicate balance within a musical ensemble and the potentially disruptive consequences that can result from even a single instrument falling out of sync."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Taking a closer look at the text: Tweet: @13bdesign gosh but i am in island girl. It appears to be a tweet from a user to another account (@13bdesign). The user is seemingly sharing their own status or experience by saying, \\"i am in island girl.\\" The term \\"gosh\\" is often used to express surprise, enthusiasm, or disbelief. The lack of negative language or expressions in the tweet suggests that the sentiment is not negative. Considering the tweet's content, we can assume that it has a positive sentiment. The use of \\"gosh\\" would most likely indicate excitement or amazement. The phrase \\"i am in island girl\\" leads us to believe that the user is having a positive experience, perhaps describing themselves as being in a great or interesting location.  In summary, the prediction for the sentiment of this tweet would be positive due to the user's enthusiastic language and the content of the tweet that implies a positive experience or situation.

Pour donner plus de détails, permettez-moi d'expliquer en détail. L'Enquête de Santé Familiale Palestinienne est une étude statistique menée annuellement pour recueillir des informations sur l'état de santé de la population palestinienne. En 2006, les résultats de cette enquête ont montré qu'une proportion importante d'enfants de moins de cinq ans en Palestine souffre de retard de croissance. C'est un problème de santé sérieux qui peut avoir des conséquences à long terme sur le développement physique et mental de l'enfant. Le retard de croissance est une condition qui résulte d'une malnutrition chronique, généralement en raison d'une alimentation insuffisante ou d'une mauvaise absorption des aliments. C'est une mesure de la santé et du bien-être de la population infantile et peut être un indicateur de l'état nutritionnel général d'une communauté ou d'un pays.

Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. She has been described, perhaps even unfairly caricatured, as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. \\"Rosenstrasse,\\" which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that paper) is not a perfect film. It is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by, of all peoples, generically powerless Germans demonstrating in a Berlin street. Co-writer von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never disclosed life as a child in the German capital during World War II. The husband of Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance, Ruth not only \\"sits shivah\\" (the Jews' week-long mourning ritual) but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith. Her apartment in New York City reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors. Her American-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a bit put-off by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis might well erupt as Ruth warns that she'll disown Hannah if she doesn't give up doting, handsome Luis. Stay tuned. A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested Hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families, in whole but usually in part, escaped the Holocaust. Those days were simply not discussed. So Hannah, having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life, traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing. Were she not, this would have been a very short film. But Ruth, pretending to be a historian, locates 90 year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), now a widow. As the happy-to-be-interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories Lena tells her story, the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the war-time capital. The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann) was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist, Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use \\"Israel\\" as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add \\"Sarah\\" to their names(incidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabian's name on its characters list with the false \\"Israel\\" included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation). While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, those married to \\"Aryans\\" were exempted. For a time. Until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity. The young Lena tries to locate her husband. All she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on Rosenstrasse. The crowd of anxious women builds up, some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them (\\"Jew-loving whore\\" being one appellation). As a subplot Lena more or less adopts eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was seized (remember, Ruth is now sitting shiva in Manhattan). The child Ruth is fetchingly portrayed by Svea Lohde.  Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail. The men, and a handful of women, are released. As in the real story the Nazis gave in, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story). Von Trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to prod the aging Lena who slowly, one gathers, begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued, the child whose mother was murdered. The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943, a set, and the street today in a bustling, rebuilt, unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes that point very well. The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation (which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-way trip to oblivion). The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past. These things happen (although the Times's critic appears not to know that). Von Trotta's hand is sure but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive. The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister, the most fanatical top-level Hitler worshiper, to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the Erich von Stroheim \\"copy and paste\\" school of Teutonic nastiness. But that's understandable. The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested. Unfortunately that argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. THAT'S why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on. The elderly Lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was \\"a ray of light\\" in an evil time. Most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war. So \\"a ray of light\\" it was and von Trotta's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists.

At this point the narrator (Harry) introduces himself and apologizes, somewhat defensively, for not being very good. \\"Do you see any other narrators?\\" he asks.

Often, low ratings are significant indicators for the restaurant owners to work ahead with improvements, elevating the dining experience and revamping their menus to align with customer expectations. It's apparent that despite its prime location in the bustling city centre, Loch Fyne needs to strengthen its position by improving its customer service and the quality of Japanese food they serve, to attract more patrons and compete effectively with nearest competitors like The Rice Boat.

Never in the past three decades has a political party taken up the reins of the world's largest democracy with an absolute majority. And never before has a provincial chief with no federal experience become head of a national government. Unprecedented invitation. In attendance on the sprawling forecourt of the sandstone palace were the premiers of Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Mauritius; the presidents of Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives; and the speaker of Bangladesh, officials say. \\"A promising gesture,\\" read the headline of an editorial in the Indian Express on Friday about India's unprecedented invitation to the leaders of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation bloc. Until his election to Parliament this month, Modi, a chief minister of the prosperous northwestern state of Gujarat, has been seen as hawkish by some political watchers, especially over relations with nuclear archrival Pakistan. His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has often accused the administration of outgoing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of being soft on its western neighbor, which New Delhi blames for a number of terror attacks in India, including the deadly 2008 assault in Mumbai. Both countries have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both claim as their own in its entirety. An editorial in the Indian Express said Modi's \\"terrific\\" move to invite regional leaders \\"should help generate a more realistic appreciation of India's foreign-policy trajectory in the coming years.\\" \\"What matters in the end, however, is the prospect of a more self-assured government in Delhi that is ready to engage the neighbors without standing on protocol and precedent,\\" it added. Economic hope. Credited for his pro-business approach as the chief of Gujarat, India's new leader has also raised expectations that his government will succeed in turning around India's slowing economy, generate more jobs and rein in soaring prices and deeply entrenched corruption, issues that are widely believed to have brought about the fall of Singh's government. Modi's party won 282 seats of the 543-seat lower house of Parliament on its own, the first independent win by any single political party in three decades. India has since been ruled by coalitions of national and regional groupings with varied political and economic philosophies. \\"The BJP's single-handed majority in the new parliament ensures at least one thing: no more excuses of fractured coalition politics compromising policies and reforms,\\" said Jahangir Aziz, J.P. Morgan's chief Asia economist, in a column in the Indian Express. \\"More growth, more employment, more infrastructure, lower inflation is just motherhood and apple pie. Identifying and articulating the binding constraints holding these back is the heart of the problem,\\" he wrote. Political analysts also describe the debacle of Singh's Congress Party government as a vote against crushing prices. \\"Moderation in prices of essential commodities is a potential challenge for Modi's government in a market-driven economy,\\" political commentator K.G. Suresh said. \\"The honeymoon period will not last longer if measures are not taken in the next 100 days to bring costs down,\\" he added. Modi's Cabinet, observers say, will signify his government's model and course. \\"It has to be a dream team that balances demands and side effects of growth with promises of low prices to millions of poverty-stricken Indians. It has to be a smart mix of youth and experience with a cohesive approach. With pressures of coalition politics no longer there, the last thing India would expect the new prime minister's core team to be is a chariot pulled by horses running in different directions,\\" Suresh said. Friend or foe? India's Narendra Modi an unknown quantity abroad. Securing India's energy a major challenge for new PM Modi. Memo to Modi: How to reboot India. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"Narendra Modi became the 15th prime minister of India in a special ceremony. This event was special because it is the first time a political party has taken control of India's government with an absolute majority in the past 30 years. Many important leaders from nearby countries attended the ceremony, showing support and unity in the region. Mr. Modi, who was a chief minister in the state of Gujarat, is known for being good at helping businesses grow. People hope that his government will be able to improve India's economy by creating more jobs and controlling prices. It is important for Mr. Modi's government to work together and make decisions that help all the people of India, including those who are poor and may struggle with high prices.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.   Q: Higher temperatures increase the rate of reaction in a lot of chemical reactions because they increase the frequency of what interaction between reactant particles?   A: Available choices: [1]. electric; [2]. explosions; [3]. waves; [4]. collisions; The answer is:","output":"[4]. collisions; Higher temperatures increase the rate of reaction in a lot of chemical reactions because they increase the frequency of collisions between reactant particles.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkish pronunciation: [re'dZep taj'jip 'aerdo(W)an] ( listen); born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician serving as the current President of Turkey, holding the position since 2014. He previously served as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. He founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2001, leading it to general election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014. In 2001, Erdogan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdogan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yilmaz and Ciller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdogan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gul became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdogan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdogan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gul handed over the post.  On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdogan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as President, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdogan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gul as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Canakkale, and one million in Izmir on 13 May.  The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdogan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey's history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey's Chief Prosecutor asked the country's Constitutional Court to ban Erdogan's governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party's public funding by 50%.  In the June 2011 elections, Erdogan's governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdogan the only prime minister in Turkey's history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%). did he have any other major influences?","output":"Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a Turkish politician who, in 2001, created a political party called the Justice and Development Party (AKP). He led the party in elections and won many times. People were sometimes worried about him becoming the President because they thought he might change the way Turkey's government works.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the premise \\"Two children read in bed.\\" true if \\"The children are reading at school.\\"?","output":"The statements \\"Two children read in bed.\\" and \\"The children are reading at school.\\" describe different situations, so we cannot definitively say that the first premise is true based on the information given in the second. To clarify the distinction between these two statements, let us first analyze each statement individually: 1. \\"Two children read in bed.\\" In this statement, the focus is on the two children who are participating in the act of reading while lying in bed. This context suggests that this activity is happening in an environment associated with rest and relaxation, most likely at home or any other place where the children have access to a bed. The statement emphasizes the location of where the reading is happening - in bed. This can indicate that the children are either reading for leisure or possibly as part of a bedtime routine. 2. \\"The children are reading at school.\\" This statement, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the children are actively engaged in reading within a school setting. This context often implies that the reading activity is carried out as part of their education, such as in a classroom or a school library. The statement emphasizes the location of where the reading is happening - at school, which indicates that this kind of reading may be guided by a teacher or related to a learning objective. Now, when we compare these two statements, we can see that they are not mutually exclusive per se. The two children engaged in reading may do so in different settings – both while in bed and at school – but these two situations do not necessarily occur simultaneously. One scenario could occur at home, outside school hours or during weekends or holidays, while the other could be happening at school. Consequently, assuming the two situations involve the same children, one cannot be used as evidence to support the validity or truth of the other. Therefore, based on the information we have from the statement \\"The children are reading at school,\\" we cannot confidently confirm the truth of the premise \\"Two children read in bed.\\" To verify the first premise, we would require additional information or context about when and where these two children read in bed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7]  At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8]  Please answer this question : Which village is situated closer to sea lever?

Article: People do not analyze every problem they meet. Sometimes they try to remember a solution from the last time they had a similar problem. They often accept the opinions or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without thinking. They try to find a solution by trial and error. However, when all these methods fail, the person with a problem has to start analyzing. There are six stages in analyzing a problem. First the person must recognize that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot read it to class as he usually does. Sam must see that there is a problem with his bicycle. Next the thinker must define the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must find out the reason why it does not work. For instance, he must determine if the problem is with the gears, the brakes, or the frame. He must make his problem more specific. Now the person must look for information that will make the problem clearer and lead to possible solutions. For instance, suppose Sam decided that his bike does not work because there is something wrong with the gear wheels. At this time, he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about gears. He can talk to his friends at the bike shop. He can look at his gears carefully. After studying the problem, the person should have several suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an illustration. His suggestions might be: put oil on the gear wheels; buy new gear wheels and replace the old ones; tighten or loosen the gear wheels. Eventually one suggestion seems to be the solution to the problem. Sometimes the final idea comes very suddenly because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a new way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees that there is a piece of chewing gum between the gear wheels. He immediately realizes the solution to his problem: he must clean the gear wheels. Finally the solution is tested. Sam cleans the gear wheels and finds that afterwards his bicycle works perfectly. he has solved the problem.

Close the lid and give your grill about 10 to 15 minutes to get hot. Scrape the hot grill rack clean with a wire brush. Brush the hot rack of your grill with oil to prevent sticking (optional). Place your patties into the grill and sear on one side for about 3 minutes. Avoid pressing down on your burgers while they are grilling.  You may see flare-ups during cooking. Flare-ups are caused by the burger fat dripping into the flames below. Carefully move your patties to a higher rack or cooler side of the grill until the flames subside. On a gas grill, you will find the cooler areas on higher racks, or along the edges of your grill, away from the flame. Using a metal spatula with a long handle, flip your patties and sear them on the other side to lock in the juices. Continue grilling until you have reached your desired doneness.

Q:I can use this background: ANOVA generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors. When the experiment includes observations at all combinations of levels of each factor, it is termed factorial. Factorial experiments are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the efficiency grows as the number of factors increases.[45] Consequently, factorial designs are heavily used.

Answer this question please: Was Medication A's trial more efficient or less efficient than Medication B's trial? A:","output":"To determine the efficiency of Medication A's trial compared to Medication B's trial, we should consider not only the success rate but also factors such as the number of participants and the duration of the trials.  Step 1: Calculate success rates for both medications. - Medication A: 80% success rate (cured 80% of the 1000 participants) - Medication B: 90% success rate (cured 90% of the 50 participants) Step 2: Evaluate the sample size. - Medication A: 1000 participants - Medication B: 50 participants Step 3: Evaluate the duration of the trials. - Medication A: 3 years - Medication B: Not provided (assuming the same duration as Medication A – 3 years) The success rate of Medication B is higher (90%) than Medication A (80%). However, the sample size of Medication B's trial (50 patients) is much smaller compared to Medication A's trial (1000 patients). The bigger sample size in Medication A's trial offers increased statistical power and reliability of the results. The duration of both trials is assumed to be the same (3 years). Taking these factors into consideration, it is difficult to directly conclude whether Medication A's trial was more efficient or less efficient than Medication B's trial without additional information.

Given the context: What will Others want to do next?  Possible answers: cry in private, hug his wife, keep watching the event Answer:","output":"Given the context and understanding Lee's emotional state, it is quite likely that others who are close to him and aware of his emotional turmoil might want to take some action to provide emotional support. However, the preferred action will depend on their knowledge of Lee's preferences and the specific circumstances of the event. Keeping this in mind, let's analyze each possible option: 1. Cry in private: If close friends or family members are aware of Lee's emotional state and understand that he might need to process his emotions privately, they might suggest that he takes a short break by stepping out of the event briefly. This option allows Lee to express his feelings openly and comfortably, without being in the public eye. Moreover, allowing Lee to compose himself before rejoining the event could ensure that he can enjoy the remainder of the occasion with ease. 2. Hug his wife: If Lee's wife is present and cognizant of her husband's emotional turmoil, she might instinctively reach out to offer physical and emotional support. A hug, in such a situation, can be a soothing gesture, providing comfort and reassurance to Lee. It demonstrates empathy and understanding and could also serve as a means of sharing the emotional weight that Lee feels compelled to suppress. Furthermore, a hug from his wife could grant Lee a fleeting moment of privacy and vulnerability, even amidst the event. 3. Keep watching the event: For some people, remaining engaged in a pleasurable event can help them cope with their emotions and derive comfort and support from a shared, positive experience. If, in this context, the individuals close to Lee think it is best to remain focused on the event for the sake of distraction or comfort, they might encourage him to keep watching. By doing so, they could be providing an unspoken emotional support and allowing Lee to process his emotions at his own pace, without drawing attention to his struggle. Given these possible actions, it is essential to consider the dynamics of the situation and the relationships between Lee and the people present. The best course of action would be to choose a response that is most suited to Lee's preferences and emotional needs, ensuring that he finds the support and understanding necessary to process his emotions in a healthy and comfortable manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?'

During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian  ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'.

Richard Allen Posner (; born January 11, 1939) is an American jurist and economist who was a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago from 1981 until 2017, and is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School. He is a leading figure in the field of law and economics, and was identified by The Journal of Legal Studies as the most cited legal scholar of the 20th century. Posner is known for his scholarly range and for writing on topics outside of his primary field, law. Posner rejects the concept of animal rights. He recognizes the philosophical force of arguments for animal rights, but maintains that human intuition about the paramount value of human life makes it impossible to accommodate an ethic of animal rights.  Posner engaged in a debate with the philosopher Peter Singer in 2001 at Slate magazine, in which Posner argued against restricting the use of animals for food and in scientific experimentation. He agreed that gratuitous cruelty to animals should be avoided, but contends that animal welfare should only be advanced where doing so provides a marginal benefit to society.  Posner argues that animal rights conflict with the moral relevance of humanity and that empathy for pain and suffering of animals does not supersede advancing society. He further argues that he trusts his moral intuition until it is shown to be wrong and that his moral intuition says that \\"it is wrong to give as much weight to a dog's pain as to an infant's pain.\\" He further states that people whose opinions were changed by consideration of the ethics presented in Singer's book Animal Liberation failed to see the \\"radicalism of the ethical vision that powers [their] view on animals, an ethical vision that finds greater value in a healthy pig than in a profoundly retarded child, that commands inflicting a lesser pain on a human being to avert a greater pain to a dog, and that, provided only that a chimpanzee has 1 percent of the mental ability of a normal human being, would require the sacrifice of the human being to save 101 chimpanzees.\\"  In a 2002 Yale Law Journal article, Posner again criticized animal rights. He also dismissed Gandhi's view that animal rights is consonant with a empathetic and moral society. He supported this conclusion by arguing that Hitler was a vegetarian and Nazi Germany had the most stringent animal-rights laws in history.

In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). The molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers. Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion. A:","output":"Task Explanation: The task requires creating an unanswerable question based on the provided passage about uranium enrichment methods. The question must appear relevant to the passage, but it cannot be answered based on the information provided. There are a few guidelines to create unanswerable questions, such as requiring a constraint not mentioned, needing information beyond the passage, modifying existing facts, or using antonyms or negation words. Unanswerable Question: What is the energy consumption comparison between the gas centrifuge process and the molecular laser isotope separation process? Explanation: This question follows guideline (ii), as it requires information beyond what is provided in the passage to answer. The passage mentions the gas centrifuge process being the cheapest and leading enrichment process and details the molecular laser isotope separation method. However, it does not provide enough data to compare the two processes' energy consumption directly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This artistic theme represents the idea that no matter one's station in life, death is the great equalizer that connects everyone. The Dance of Death originated in Basel, a city located in present-day Switzerland, in the form of a mural painted on the walls of the city's Dominican Cemetery during the 15th century. Death from Basel represents the personification of death, as a skeleton or other macabre figure, who leads people of different societal statuses – such as royalty, clergy, merchants, and peasants – in a dance to their graves. The origin of the Dance of Death theme can be traced back to earlier traditions, such as the biblical concept of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, where death is one of the central figures. It gained popularity during the time of social, political, and religious turmoil that characterized the Late Middle Ages, as well as the massive demographic impact caused by the outbreak of the Black Death pandemic in the 14th century, which killed millions of people across Europe. The Dance of Death grew as a common motif in art, literature, and music during the Late Medieval and Renaissance periods. Artists like Holbein the Younger, Albrecht Dürer, and Michael Wolgemut incorporated this theme into their works, creating woodcuts, frescoes, and illuminated manuscript illustrations that featured Death as an active participant. Performances called \\"dances macabre\\" would also be enacted in churchyards or graveyards, where actors dressed as skeletons, musicians, and other characters would perform lively dances that mimicked the process of life and death. One of the most famous examples of Dance of Death artwork is the series of woodcuts called \\"Dance of Death Alphabet,\\" created by Renaissance artist Hans Holbein the Younger. The series features 41 designs, with each portraying different social classes or professions encountered by Death. This collection showcases the idea that regardless of wealth, status, or power, every individual will eventually face their inevitable demise. In summary, \\"Basel's dance of death\\" and \\"Death from Basel\\" refer to the same artistic concept born in Basel, Switzerland, during the Late Middle Ages, where death is personified and acts as an equalizer among people from various social strata. This theme served as a reminder of the inevitable end that awaits every individual and as a representation of the fragility and temporality of human life. Its profound impact can still be found in contemporary artistic and cultural expressions today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Alona's persistent knocking at the door of room 412 went unanswered for three minutes as she nervously shuffled her feet. Her book bag was super-saturated with textbooks, notebooks, schedules, rough drafts, and various other forms of academic paraphernalia. It was getting heavier. She continued to knock, even though there had as yet been no answer, because the note card tacked to the right of the door indicated that these indeed were Prof. Turgy K. Sigger's office hours. She could see the light under the door and thought she had heard a groan. Just before she decided to give up, slow feet approached from the opposite side, then silence; with a dramatic turn of the knob, the door swung open. \\"Was this trip really necessary?\\" asked Prof. Sigger, blinking and brushing his oily, graying hair back into place. \\"These are your office hours,\\" Alona replied. She nervously smiled, feeling the corners of her mouth twitch. Somewhere in the darkened hall, a janitor coughed. \\"All right,\\" conceded Prof. Sigger. \\"Come in.\\" The carpet was smothered by leaning towers of textbooks. Papers lined the left side of the desk, above which was a small note card which read \\"To Be Graded.\\" On the right side, the oak finish gleamed of the mid-morning light piercing the Venetian blinds. \\"You've come about your final project,\\" Prof. Sigger stated. \\"It's only mid-term,\\" Alona reminded him. \\"Oh yes, yes,\\" continued Prof. Sigger, without conscious embarrassment. \\"Mid-term grade.

Translate to English English:","output":"The Schaffner report demonstrates a blatant disregard for national democracies - for example, in paragraph 1, where it is proposed that the Council implements Article 7(a) (this article concerns the removal of internal borders and strengthening of controls at external borders) without taking considerable account of national law. In this statement, the criticism points out that the Schaffner report shows a serious contempt for the democratic processes and sovereignty of individual nations. By proposing that the Council implement Article 7(a) with minimal consideration for national laws, it undermines the authority and autonomy of the countries involved in decision-making processes. This may lead to tensions and conflicts, both on political and societal levels, as it disregards the unique legal frameworks and principles of each nation. The emphasis on removing internal borders and strengthening control at external borders, as laid out in Article 7(a), could also give rise to issues concerning immigration and border security. While this objective aims to promote cooperation and ease of movement within the participating countries, it could inadvertently create problems. These may include a lack of resources and infrastructure for controlling the influx of people, as well as potential social and cultural clashes resulting from an increase in migration. Furthermore, this approach might exacerbate inequality and feelings of injustice among affected countries, as those with more flexible legal systems or aligned with the Council's goals may perceive it as unfair that they had to adapt their laws significantly, while others did not. Moreover, it could contribute to a general sentiment of resentment towards regional or global organizations, fueling anti-establishment and nationalist movements. To avoid such consequences, it is crucial that international decisions, such as those proposed in the Schaffner report, are made with a high degree of respect for national legislations and democratic principles. This can be achieved by actively involving all relevant parties, conducting thorough assessments of each nation's laws, and promoting a meaningful dialogue between the Member States. By doing so, it is possible to create a more equitable and efficient framework for cooperation without undermining national sovereignty and democratic processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The case has caught the attention of both German and Russian authorities, drawing considerable public interest and sparking concerns about interfering in the legal proceedings. Background: The case began with a young German-Russian girl reportedly claiming to be the victim of rape. While the details surrounding the incident remain unclear, there has been a surge in opinions and reactions, especially from Russian officials and media outlets. German authorities are concerned that the sensitive nature of the case is being manipulated for political gains by Russia, potentially jeopardizing the ongoing legal processes and investigation. Germany's Warning: Germany has been vocal in its displeasure about the potential interference from Russia. The German government has warned Russia to refrain from using the case as a platform for political agendas, with the intention of upholding the integrity of the ongoing legal proceedings. German officials have emphasized the importance of allowing the investigation to continue without hindrance or outside influence to ensure a fair and accurate outcome. Russia's Response: Although Russia has not explicitly addressed Germany's warning, it has continued to express interest in the case and support the alleged victim. Russian officials have stressed the importance of justice and the need to investigate the situation thoroughly. They have not, however, acknowledged any political motivation behind their actions, maintaining that their primary concern is the welfare of the girl involved. The Importance of Protecting Legal Integrity: The potential politicization of legal cases, particularly those of a sensitive nature, can have serious consequences. It is crucial that authorities remain transparent, fair, and focused on the pursuit of justice without being influenced by external political agendas. Legal processes should also remain independent from any political or social pressures to ensure that all parties involved – victims, suspects, and witnesses – are able to present their case and seek justice without fear of bias or interference. Conclusion: Germany's warning to Russia signifies the importance of maintaining an objective perspective in such sensitive cases. As the investigation unfolds, it is essential that all involved parties respect the boundaries of the legal process and allow justice to prevail. The alleged rape case involving a German-Russian girl should serve as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of political interference in criminal investigations, emphasizing the need for neutrality, fairness, and impartiality in every step of the legal proceedings."},{"instruction":"Aubrey finally decided to clean her bedroom, and after of hours of deeep cleaning she found clothes under their bed.

Context: As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women’s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher. My PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) – a weighty force in UK academia – the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda. There is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world.

Movie title: You Donât Get Life a Second Time Movie plot: The film opens with Kabir (Abhay Deol) proposing to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). Their families meet at the engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends Imran (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of them will have to pick an adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is reluctant to take trip as he does not want to lose his pay for missing work. It is later revealed that Arjun's former girlfriend left him due to his workaholism and his obsession with money. Imran has an additional personal agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain. They fly to Spain separately, where they plan to visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. Imran nonchalantly throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car while he is in the middle of an official call. This leads to a heated argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of having an affair, four years prior, with Arjun's previous girlfriend Sonali (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After being pacified by Kabir and reaching their destination, they meet an Anglo Indian named Laila (Katrina Kaif) on a beach. Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir reveals that he has chosen deep sea diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila. She helps him overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Upon a request by Laila, they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in BuÃ±ol and meet Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), who falls in love with Imraan. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious of Kabir's involvement with Laila when she sees them via webcam and crashes his bachelor party trip,...

The market for used cars is also strong. ‘‘Managers are actually getting involved in selling cars because we don’t have enough salespeople,’’ says Paul Selvaggi, president of the dealership and service center. Faulkner has hired a sales manager, its first new employee since the third quarter of last year. Up next: salespeople, workers to service cars, and employees who develop new sources of revenue. Small businesses held off hiring until they had enough business to justify taking more risks. As recently as March, an American Express survey found 76 percent of owners planned to hire only when their revenue rose. The ripple effect from growth in construction and consumer spending is feeding the increase, says Susan Woodward, an economist who helps software maker Intuit compile its hiring surveys. Liliana Aranda’s business began picking up in March. Her four-year-old company, Faces By Liliana, gives facials, massages, and other spa treatments in homes or offices in the San Francisco area. Her business has done well since its start, but she never needed to hire. When clients held spa parties for their friends, she looked for freelancers to help. In early spring, Aranda suddenly started getting more appointments. She attributes the bump in business to people splurging again after the recession and its aftermath. ‘‘They make a point of saying, I’ve earned this, I’m going to treat myself, and I’m not afraid to spend a little more,’’ she says. The size of Aranda’s spa parties was larger than in the past — 11 to 14 people compared to six to eight. Revenue is up 20 percent so far this year. The increase in business made hiring three part-time employees who she could always rely on a necessity. The recovery in South Florida’s real estate market and economy has allowed Tadd Schwartz’s public relations firm to step up its hiring. Schwartz Media Strategies usually hired one or two employees annually the past six years, but in the last three months, he has added three full-time staffers and two interns, putting his payroll at 17. That’s up from 12 staffers a year ago. Schwartz has been confident enough to hire before sealing a deal with new clients. He wants to have enough people on staff to hit the ground running when a contract is signed. ‘‘We want to position our firm so we’re not only able to service our clients, but be in a position where we don’t have to say no to the right client,’’ he says. Schwartz Media’s revenue is up about 16 percent so far in 2014. If Schwartz lands two or three more big accounts, he says, he will start recruiting again. Publicity the last few months about Brad Barrett’s product Grill Grate sent orders for the backyard grill accessory soaring. Barrett, who was cautious while building his seven-year-old company, had six employees including himself and his wife. He expected that to be enough. But orders flooded in faster than expected, and over the Independence Day weekend, the Barretts had to fill orders themselves for their product, which creates a raised grilling surface for backyard grills. ‘‘We were inside the entire weekend,’’ he says. Barrett is now looking for two workers for the Cartersville, Ga., company — one to help fill orders and the other to handle administrative and marketing tasks. ‘‘We’ve waited perhaps a bit too long. Business is up substantially and the six of us are scrambling,’’ Barrett says. Barrett expected his revenue to grow 40 percent in 2014, but sales of Grill Grate are already up 55 percent from this time last year. ‘‘We’ve only made a small dent in the amount of replacements that need to be done,’’ says Marcus, whose company has 18 employees in Tempe, Ariz., and five in Woodland Hills, Calif. The economy is also a factor in Marcus’s 29 percent revenue surge this year. Small business clients are hiring workers who need computers. And companies that delayed replacing XP systems because of cash flow problems have more money. ‘‘They’re saying, ‘We’ve held out for so long, now we just have to do this,’ ’’ he says. Summary:","output":"A surge in hiring at small businesses seems to be underway as owners who initially resisted hiring after the recession are now taking on workers to keep up with the increasing demand for products and services. Small businesses had put off hiring until they had enough business to justify taking more risks. The growth in construction and consumer spending is fueling this increase."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write highlights for this article: A coastal cafe is bringing back good manners just one coffee at a time. Owners of Seven Mile Beach Kiosk in Gerroa, on the New South Wales' south coast, have put up a sign which is not only encouraging customers to be more polite, but it is putting a smile on their faces. For about two months, the sign which reads 'A coffee: 5, A coffee please: 4.50, Good morning, a coffee please: 4' has been greeting coffee drinkers. Cafe owners Kev Chilver and wife, Kylie Pickett, own the Seven Mile Beach Kiosk on the NSW south coast. Owner Kev Chilver said he and his wife, Kylie Pickett, wanted to bring back good manners after one of their employees saw a similar sign elsewhere. 'Common courtesy is ... becoming less and less common, and we're trying to bring it back,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We are in service industry but we’re not servants. We deserve as much respect as anyone else. 'Please and thank you go a long way.' Mr Chilver (pictured here with chef Megan Jones) said he and his wife wanted to bring back common courtesy with the sign. Chef Megan Jones said the sign's purpose has been fulfilled, saying customers having been noticeably more polite to staff. Mr Chilver - who has owned the kiosk with Ms Pickett for four years - said reactions to the sign had been good. 'It gives people a smile and starts their day off,' he said. 'We have some people who try it on and say \\"please\\", thank you\\" and \\"have a nice day\\" and then \\"Can I have it [coffee] for three dollars?\\".' And the sign's desired effect has been panning out. Chef Megan Jones said people were going out of their way to be nicer. 'People have been saying keep the change and they've been a lot nicer and we saw a change in the customers,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'People tended to come in and say \\"Coffee thanks\\" and there was no \\"Hi, how are you?\\"' Mr Chilver and Kylie Pickett have owned the kiosk for about four years, penning the sign about two months ago. Mr Chilver said the sign was a gimmick and the kiosk did not enforce it but it put a smile on people's faces. But Mr Chilver said they did not go as far as enforcing the sign. 'It’s just put up there as a gimmick to cheer people up. We never enforce it,' he said. 'We couldn't take it that far.' This campaign to bring back 'good manners' comes after a Newcastle business owner told parents with noisy children to steer clear of her cafe and a Brazilian-born Australian barista was denied work because he was black at Darlinghurst premises earlier this year. The Little French Cafe owner Jodie Morris in Broadmeadow, near Newcastle, north of Sydney, asked customers to refrain from bringing their unruly offspring into her establishment in a Facebook post. The post, which was made about a week ago, sparked such a backlash from people that it has since been removed. But Ms Morris said business had never been better despite the negative comments. Two months before that, Nilson Dos Santos was rejected from a job at Forbes and Burton café in Darlinghurst - in Sydney's inner-city - with owner Steven Hu citing he 'had not seen African baristas' before. Mr Hu has apologised to Mr Dos Santos but said he stood by his decision to not hire the 39-year-old.","output":"A café in Gerroa, New South Wales, is encouraging politeness by offering discounts on coffee based on how customers order.

They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Would the complications be more severe for Patty or for John if it is found they have chlamydia?  At a doctor's office, two people come in to get STD tests. John comes in and reports the only symptom he has is a rash on his thighs. Patty says she has seen something leaking out of her vagina, and she's not sure what it is. The doctor takes a urine sample from each and will give them the results in a day or two.  Hint: Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis. But in many cases it causes no symptoms. As a result, people do not know they are infected, so they don’t go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections may leave a woman unable to have children.","output":"Based on the given information, if either Patty or John were found to have chlamydia, the complications would likely be more severe for Patty. This is primarily because the potential long-term consequences of a chlamydia infection can be more serious for females. If left untreated, chlamydia in women can develop into pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These types of infections can subsequently lead to fertility problems, increasing the likelihood that the woman becomes unable to have children. Chronic pelvic pain, and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (a potentially life-threatening pregnancy occurring outside of the uterus) are also associated with untreated or recurrent chlamydia infections in females. In contrast, while men could also have complications from chlamydia, such as urethral infection, epididymitis (inflamed testicles), or rare cases of infertility, the potential complications are generally less severe than in women. Moreover, based on the symptoms provided, it seems more plausible that Patty may be infected with chlamydia. Patty reports an abnormal vaginal discharge, which is a common symptom of chlamydia in women. John, on the other hand, only reports a rash on his thighs, which is not typically associated with chlamydia in men. However, as the text suggests, many people with chlamydia do not know they are infected as it often causes no symptoms. Hence, both of them would need to wait for the test results to confirm any possible infection.  Nevertheless, it's important to remember that parties, regardless of gender, should seek medical assistance once they notice any symptoms or suspect that they might have contracted an STI like chlamydia, as early detection and treatment can significantly prevent or reduce any potential complications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is a rush transcript from \\"Hannity,\\" September 6, 2011. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: It took 24 hours but at long last, the White House has issued a response to the shocking remarks that were delivered by the Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa, who urged an amped-up union crowd to quote, \\"Take those Tea Party sons of bitches out.\\" Now \\"The Anointed One\\" has been calling on you and me to tone down the heated rhetoric since January. But as usual, he and his team, they don't practice what they preach. Now here's what the White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer told WMAL radio earlier today. DAN PFEIFFER, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: I think that this is a bit of a parlor game in Washington which is, let's try to take anything that anyone who supports politicians, or the president or -- candidates says, and pin it on them and make the, you know, the president have to serve as the speech police for the Democratic Party and someone in the Republican... UNIDENTIFIED MAN: But Dan, he said that he has an army ready to do the president's bidding. And it was time to take the SOBs out. That's a sort of a harsh thing that you should say before the president of the United States speaks. The president has called for, you know, a greater and higher political discourse in this country. This doesn't seem to meet the standard. PFEIFFER: Well, look, that's a judgment for you guys to make. It is a judgment for others to make. HANNITY: Now, I have a judgment. The president is more than happy to serve as the chief of the speech police that's for conservatives, for Republicans, for me, for you, of course, members of the Tea Party Movement, just not for members of his own party. Maxine Waters, \\"you can go straight to hell.\\" Frederica Wilson, thinks you are the real enemy. His own vice president who referred to the Tea Party members as terrorists. And joining me now with reaction, the author of the terrific brand new book called, it's called \\"A Point in Time: The Search for Redemption in This Life and the Next,\\" David Horowitz. The co-host of \\"The Five,\\" always getting in trouble, always having to be defended is our own Bob Beckel. Bob, good to see you. BOB BECKEL, CO-HOST, \\"THE FIVE\\": Good to see you. HANNITY: David, good to see you, too. DAVID HOROWITZ, AUTHOR, \\"A POINT IN TIME\\": Hey. HANNITY: Congrats on the book. This was -- the guy who wrote the art of political war, this is it. This is what we are talking about here. And this is a far more reflective book and a lot of your wisdom. Let me ask you this. Bob Beckel, when Hoffa says, you know, we are at war with them, we are going to take those sons of bitches out, we need jobs. Most Americans are not union members. He's talking about unions, not talking about the American people, the 15 million Americans that are out of work, the other Americans that are under employed, is he? BECKEL: Listen. I really can't quite get what the big deal is here. I mean, I know Jimmy Hoffa and he is not a guy who is a soft spoken guy. Now, would I have used those words now that I have finished calling the Tea Party all the names I could call them, I now call a truce. And I don't call them that. I say they are Tea people and that is fine. Now, but what Hoffa was talking about was, what I said, is let's stop calling them names and let's get to win the war with them, and that war is in the elections because that's where we are going to beat them. And by the way, the Tea Party doesn't represent much in America. Right now, they had a poll out today, among Republicans, they're half, what, positive and negative about the Tea Party. HANNITY: All right. Let's go to a montage of the president, David. I'll get your reaction about -- the issue here is the double standard, the hypocrisy. Here's President Obama calling for civility again and again. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, JAN. 12: Only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to the challenges of our nation. JIMMY HOFFA, PRESIDENT, TEAMSTERS, SEPT. 5: Let's take these son of a (bleep) out. OBAMA, JAN. 12: We can question each other's ideas without questioning each other's love of country. REP. FREDERICA WILSON, D-FLA., AUG. 23: Let's all remember who the real enemy is. OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: I do hope that we will talk with each other and not over each other. WILSON, AUG. 23: The real enemy is the Tea Party. OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: Where we do disagree, let's disagree over things that are real. Not these wild misrepresentations. REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF., AUG. 23: The Tea Party can go straight to hell. OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: People who want to keep things the way they are will try to scare the heck out of folks. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, SEPT. 5: You are the only folks keeping the barbarians in the gate. OBAMA, AUG. 11, 2009: Create bogeyman out there that just aren't real. HOROWITZ: Well, when it comes Sean, to bold-face lying to the American people, Barack Obama makes Bill Clinton look like a boy scout. I've never seen a president lie with such aplomb and so consistently over so long a time as Barack Obama. It is totally hypocritical. And you know, Bob put a kind of nice spin on the Hoffa speech. This is the language of warfare. This is so destructive to a democracy. Our politics has become unbelievably ugly. And the Democrats for reasons actually, I don't refer to Democrats, but I explain in my book, people on the left are basically in a religious movement. They want to see a redemption in this life. And they see conservatives like us, we are the party of Satan for them. And that's the way they treat us. Whereas conservatives tend to be on the whole, civil, they give people the benefit of the doubt and they are. BECKEL: Excuse me, I'm sorry. HOROWITZ: It is OK, we forgive you.

Article: Harry Houdini was a man who astonished and attracted many people during his life. Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive.  Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money.  When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs. However, no matter what tricks they did or how hard they tried, Bess and Harry were not doing well. They tried to sell their shows for seven years and finally, in desperation, they went to Europe.           It was the right move. Harry's persistence and...

Eröffnung der Sitzung Translate this to English?","output":"Opening of the session The German phrase \\"Eröffnung der Sitzung\\" translates to \\"Opening of the session\\" in English. The term \\"Eröffnung\\" means \\"opening\\" or \\"inauguration,\\" while \\"der Sitzung\\" refers to \\"the session\\" or \\"the meeting.\\" Often used in professional contexts such as conferences, seminars, or governmental meetings, the term indicates the beginning or commencement of a formal event, meeting, or discussion. The purpose of such gatherings is to engage in meaningful discussions, share information, or make decisions, and the opening of the session serves as the starting point for achieving these objectives. At the opening of the session, a designated chairperson or moderator usually welcomes and greets the attendees, sets the tone for the meeting, and lays out the agenda for the discussion. The chairperson might also introduce key speakers, participants, or even the general purpose of the event itself. Depending on the nature and formality of the gathering, this could be followed by opening statements or presentations by participants or members of the audience, who may be experts in their respective fields or individuals with vested interests in the topic under discussion. In addition to setting the tone and objectives for the session, the opening also serves as an opportunity for participants or attendees to liaise with one another, establish rapport, and engage in informal networking. Such interactions often serve to forge connections, identify potential areas of collaboration, and facilitate a freer and more open exchange of ideas. The progression of the session will typically involve a series of presentations, panel discussions, or interactive workshops aimed at furthering the understanding of the subject matter and fostering collaboration.

Given the question \\"Why did Austin do this?\\", is \\"keep water bad as it is\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"keep water bad as it is\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Austin do this?\\" Instead, a more a detailed and accurate answer is as follows: Austin treated Jan's water well for the bad mineral rock deposits because these deposits can negatively impact the quality of the water, making it unsuitable or unsafe for consumption, and might even lead to potential health issues. Mineral deposits can come in various forms, such as calcium, lime, or magnesium, and can alter the taste, odor, and appearance of the water. By treating the well water, Austin's goal was to improve the water quality, optimize its safety for everyday use, and potentially extend the life of the well system. Treating for mineral deposits can also help protect plumbing systems, water heaters, and appliances that use the well water, as these deposits may cause scaling and buildup in pipes and heating elements, leading to device malfunction and costly repairs. In summary, Austin treated Jan's water well to remove the bad mineral deposits in order to enhance the water quality, ensure its safety for consumption, and protect the well system and household appliances from potential damage caused by mineral buildup.

On December 17, 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi, a young Tunisian street vendor, set himself on fire and started a dramatic remaking of the political landscape. The striking of a match brought change not only in Tunisia, but also in Egypt and Libya, and even what is happening in Syria. On the other hand, as of August this year, about 48 Tibetans, mostly Buddhist monks and nuns, have self-immolated in Tibetan parts of China. In March 2012 alone, seven people self-immolated, and Tibetan exiles in India have been setting themselves on fire. The political result? Nothing. So why does the self-immolation of one man accomplish so much, but the same gesture performed by so many others accomplishes nothing? Perhaps the question should be phrased differently, because a closer look at Bouazizi's deed and the Tibetan cases reveals that it is something other than the sheer number of self-immolations that makes them a catalyst for change. Two more Tibetans self-immolate in China protest. Tunisians could easily identify with Bouazizi's extreme predicament. His actions spoke to the community's shared frustration and despair. But the demands of Tibetan self-immolators are varied. Some want a \\"free Tibet,\\" as do all Tibetan exiles, but others only want freedom of religion, or political autonomy, or the opportunity to study in Tibetan as opposed to Chinese, or the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet. When a self-immolator like Bouazizi is perceived as taking upon himself the humiliations and shameful submissions, the collective cowardice and voluntary servitude of his people, he burns off, along with his body, the diffuse sense of shame and guilt that has been paralyzing his community. The burning body thus becomes a site of cleansing, catharsis and regeneration. The community is going -- vicariously, but no less effectively -- through a \\"purification by fire.\\" And in the process an important thing takes place: That society reinvents itself, it is transformed from a shattered community into a political community. As the body is being devoured by flames, the promise (if only the promise) of a new beginning takes shape. The self-immolations of Thích Quàng Đúc in Saigon in 1963 and Jan Palach in Prague in 1969 were not very different from that of Bouazizi. The former was a Buddhist monk who self-immolated to draw attention to the persecution of Buddhists in Vietnam under the Ngô Đình Diem's regime; the latter was a philosophy student who did the same thing in Prague as a response to the Soviet Union's crush of the Prague Spring. Self-immolations that prompt political change are extraordinary and rare events. The ancient Greeks had two different words for time: chronos for ordinary time and kairos for time of special quality -- a particularly propitious time for which our \\"right time\\" is a rather weak translation. For self-immolations to be politically successful, they have to happen in kairos. Bouazizi, Đúc and Palach had many imitators, but none since have achieved so much. That's why the high number of self-immolations among Tibetans lately could be read as an implicit admission of failure. Even though the first self-immolation by a former Tibetan monk, Thupten Ngodup, on April 27, 1998, in New Delhi, had some public impact, it failed to cause the political commotion that Bouazizi triggered in the Arab world. Nor have any of the other Tibetan self-immolators since. Yet, this should not surprise us. There is a strong rejection of violence in Buddhism. Even through self-immolations took place in medieval China and 20th-century Vietnam, even though the Lotus Sutra praises \\"burning for Buddha\\" as the supreme self-sacrifice, Buddhists are very reluctant to condone violence. Tibetan Buddhism, in particular, is centered on compassion toward all sentient beings and prohibition of murder, suicide included. Such a religious and cultural viewpoint must prevent ordinary Tibetans from identifying with the self-immolators. Accommodating this radical form of violence within a culture that has for centuries fed on cosmic compassion and political non-violence is not an easy process. That is why the recent string of self-immolations in Tibetan parts of China is a sign that this could be changing. Most self-immolators are young -- some are teens -- which indicates that the new generation of politically aware Tibetans might have lost patience with the Dalai Lama's nonviolent political philosophy and want to respond differently to the Chinese's aggressive methods. What we see now is possibly the beginning of a new type of political engagement in Tibet, a new pattern very different from Bouazizi's and Palach's, who emerged from communities that had been brought to their knees. Tibetans, instead, over the last 60 years have considered their nation as occupied, but not defeated. Since 1959 they have with some regularity risen against the Chinese authorities. It's very disturbing to watch these self-immolations, but that is part of the intent. The Tibetans want the Chinese and the world to look. The meaning of their gesture lies in its total passivity. It is no accident that after every self-immolation the Chinese authorities scramble to confiscate and destroy any pictures taken; they are only too aware of the iconic status such images can acquire. In essence, these self-immolations are an extreme form of political self-expression. They are performed as part of a struggle for recognition, as an autonomous political community. It confirms what Thích Nhất Hạnh was saying in 1967: \\"To burn oneself by fire is to prove that what one is saying is of the utmost importance. There is nothing more painful than burning oneself. To say something while experiencing this kind of pain is to say it with utmost courage, frankness, determination and sincerity.\\" For many Tibetan monks and nuns of today the burning body has become a tool for the most resounding of self-assertions; when you are in flames your presence cannot be ignored anymore. It is a shouting game of sorts, except that no party shouts. The Tibetans express themselves by burning; the Chinese authorities do the same by shooting Tibetans. Then, another monk or nun engages in self-expression and everything starts anew. Palden Gyatso, a Tibetan monk who spent more than 30 years in Chinese prisons and labor camps, once said: \\"For those who use brute force, there is nothing more insulting than a victim's refusal to acknowledge their power.\\" Rarely has the desire for recognition been so desperate and moving. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Costica Bradatan. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1. In contrast to Bouazizi's self-immolation, which sparked the Arab Spring, the self-immolations by Tibetans have not catalyzed significant political change. 2. Bouazizi's act resonated with a shared sense of frustration and despair among Tunisians, while the demands of Tibetan self-immolators are varied and less unified. 3. Successful self-immolations happen in 'kairos,' or a particularly opportune moment, which has not yet occurred for the Tibetans. 4. Tibetan Buddhism's emphasis on non-violence and compassion may prevent ordinary Tibetans from identifying with self-immolators. 5. The new generation of Tibetans may be losing patience with the Dalai Lama's nonviolent political philosophy and looking for a different response to Chinese aggression. 6. Self-immolations can serve as an extreme form of political self-expression in the struggle for recognition. 7.

A:","output":"Severus Snape becomes a double-agent in the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix, which was founded by Albus Dumbledore. The Order of the Phoenix is a group of wizards and witches committed to fighting against the dark forces led by the evil Lord Voldemort and his followers, known as Death Eaters. The organization was initially formed during the First Wizarding War to counteract the rising threats of Voldemort and his dark agenda. Albus Dumbledore, the esteemed and powerful wizard, was a professor and later the headmaster at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was widely regarded as one of the most skilled and wise wizards of his time, playing a crucial role in the fight against Lord Voldemort and his followers in both the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Severus Snape, a former Death Eater, switched sides and became a double-agent working for Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix. His decision to become a double-agent was primarily driven by his love for a fellow Hogwarts student, Lily Evans. After hearing a prophecy involving the possible downfall of Lord Voldemort at the hands of Lily's son, Harry Potter, Snape regretfully realized the danger he had inadvertently put Lily in by sharing the prophecy with Voldemort. When he sought Dumbledore's help to protect Lily and her family, Dumbledore agreed but only if Snape would work as a double-agent within the Death Eaters, providing valuable information to the Order and aiding in the fight against dark forces. Throughout the series, Snape's true loyalties remained clouded, and it was only revealed in the final book, \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\" that Snape had indeed been working on Dumbledore's side the whole time. Throughout his time as a double-agent, Snape faced considerable challenges, including protecting Harry Potter, whom he disliked due to past animosity with Harry's father, James Potter, and maintaining Voldemort's trust without revealing his true allegiance.

Newly relocated in the Scottish town of Greenock, Lizzie accepts a job at the local fish and chips shop owned by a friendly woman named Marie, and enrolls Frankie in school. Through a Glasgow post office box, Frankie maintains a regular correspondence with someone he believes to be his father, Davey, who allegedly is a merchant seaman working on the HMS Accra.

Summarize this article: Leigh Corfman, who claimed that former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore molested her when she was 14 years old, has filed a defamation lawsuit against him.      The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Montgomery County Circuit Court, also names Moore's campaign as a defendant.      Moore and his campaign committee \\"have defamed Ms. Corfman, repeatedly and in all forms of media, calling her a liar and questioning her motivation for publicly disclosing that Mr. Moore sexually abused her in 1979 when she was a 14-year-old high school freshman and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney.\\"      The allegations by Corfman, first reported Nov. 9 by The Washington Post, were the centerpiece of a scandal that plagued Moore's campaign over the final month, which ended with a narrow loss to Democrat Doug Jones.      Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations made by Corfman and other women of unwanted romantic or sexual advances.      Corfman has confirmed the Post's account to AL.com.      \\"The decision to sue Mr. Moore and his campaign committee was difficult, but they need to be held responsible for their actions,\\" Corfman said in a written statement to AL.com. \\"Mr. Moore sexually abused me when I was only 14 years old. Then he and his campaign called me a liar and immoral when I publicly disclosed his misconduct. They ignored my requests to stop attacking me and to acknowledge the truth. Just last week, after the election, they filed a lawsuit in which they once again called me a liar. By this lawsuit, I seek to do what I could not do as a 14-year-old--hold Mr. Moore and those who enable him accountable.\\"      A phone message left by AL.com at the office of Moore attorney Trent Garmon was not immediately returned Thursday.      The 29-page lawsuit seeks for the defendants to retract all defamatory statements made against Corfman, to publicly apologize for those statements and to refrain from further defamatory statements as well as to pay the costs and expenses of the lawsuit. The suit also asks for \\"further relief as permitted by law and as the court deems appropriate.\\"      The lawsuit also pointed to the legal filing by Moore and his campaign on Dec. 27, 2017 that was an effort to stop the election results from being certified by the state of Alabama. In that document, Corfman's allegations were described as \\"false and malicious.\\"      Corfman's lawsuit also raised the issue of a Nov. 28 open letter from her to Moore provided to AL.com that \\"asked him to stop denying his sexual abuse of her in 1979, to acknowledge his misconduct, and to apologize.\\"      \\"Instead, the lawsuit said, \\"Moore continued his attacks, accusing Ms. Corfman of lying and having improper purposes. He made these statements at campaign rallies, in interviews, on the internet, on the radio, on television, and in newspapers. Mr. Moore has claimed, among other assertions, that Ms. Corfman's account is 'completely false,' 'malicious,' 'politically motivated,' that it reflects 'the immorality of our time,' and that 'there is not one ounce of truth in her accusations.'\\"      The lawsuit said that as a result of the statements made by Moore and his campaign, Corfman took a temporary leave of absence from her job without compensation.      Corfman said she has not received any compensation from The Post or any other source for disclosing her encounter with Moore.      \\"Ms. Corfman is a private citizen whose only motivation is to clear her name and to stop Mr. Moore and the Moore Campaign Committee from continuing their defamatory attacks on her,\\" the lawsuit said. \\"Ms. Corfman wishes that defendants had heeded her requests to cease their defamation of her and seeks judicial intervention as a last resort to hold Defendants accountable for their misconduct, including a declaration that defendants' denials of Mr. Moore's sexual abuse of her and their characterization of her account of this abuse as 'false,' 'malicious,' and 'immoral,' among other untrue statements, are defamatory, as well as injunctive relief against these statements. Mr. Moore and the Moore Campaign Committee will likely continue their defamation of Ms. Corfman unless this Court orders them to stop.\\"      The lawsuit outlines 11 instances in which Moore publicly denied Corfman's allegations or denied knowing her altogether.      \\"All these statements by Mr. Moore are defamatory,\\" the lawsuit said. \\"Mr. Moore sexually abused Ms. Corfman in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was in his early 30s, and Mr. Moore's denials of these facts are false and his characterizations of Ms. Corfman and her motivations are untrue. Mr. Moore knew or should have known that Ms. Corfman's account is truthful because he was the perpetrator in the events she described.

Leigh Corfman has filed the suit in state court in Montgomery, Ala.

Jones was sworn in on Wednesday.      ADVERTISEMENT      The Washington Post first published Corfman’s account in November, about a month before the special election. The newspaper also spoke with two other women who said Moore made advances toward them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.      In the following weeks, multiple other women came forward to accuse Moore of sexual misconduct, including one woman who alleged Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16.      Moore repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them a conspiracy by establishment Republicans and the media to get him to drop out of the race. He also denied knowing Corfman, saying, \\"I never talked to her, never had any contact with her.\\"      His supporters and campaign representatives said in interviews that they did not believe the women and called them liars.      Moore has still not conceded following his Dec. 12 electoral loss. He filed a court complaint in an attempt to stop the results from being certified, but a court rejected Moore’s protest and declared Jones the winner.      In his filing, Moore said he took a polygraph test after the election to confirm that the allegations against him were false. ||||| Senate candidate Roy Moore, with his wife Kayla Moore, talk to the media after voting and arriving by horse at the Gallant Volunteer Fire Department in Gallant, Ala. on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2017. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)      In a lawsuit that echoes a civil case against President Trump, an Alabama woman on Thursday sued failed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore and his campaign for defamation, citing harsh personal attacks she faced after coming forward with allegations that he touched her sexually when she was 14 years old.      Leigh Corfman is not seeking financial compensation beyond legal costs, said her attorney, Neil Roman. She is asking for a declaratory judgment of defamation, a public apology from Moore, and a court-enforced ban on him or his campaign publicly attacking her again. Corfman said in a statement that the suit seeks “to do what I could not do as a 14-year-old — hold Mr. Moore and those who enable him accountable.”      A representative of Moore’s campaign, Brett Doster, said, “We look forward to transparently discussing these matters in a court of law.”      Corfman told The Washington Post in November that when Moore was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney in 1979, he took her to his house, undressed her, touched her over her underpants and bra and guided her hand to touch his genitals over his underwear.      The allegations upended the race. On Election Day, exit polls showed 52 percent of voters in Alabama believed the allegations against Moore were probably or definitely true, and 7 percent said those allegations were the most important factor in deciding their vote. Doug Jones’s victory marked the first time in 25 years that a Democrat in Alabama won a U.S. Senate race.      Roy Moore accuser Leigh Corfman spoke to the “Today” show Nov. 20, following allegations she made in The Washington Post that U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14. (Taylor Turner/The Washington Post)      Among Moore’s statements that the suit claims are defamatory: He called Corfman’s allegations of abuse “politically motivated,” “completely false” and “malicious.” On Nov. 10, the day after The Post published its story, Moore told Sean Hannity of Fox News he had never met Corfman. Weeks later, in a complaint that unsuccessfully sought to disqualify the election results, Moore said a polygraph examination confirmed that he did not know her.      Corfman was among five women who told The Post that Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s.      Doug Jones is sworn in, shrinking GOP Senate majority      Corfman’s suit — filed in Montgomery County, Ala., one day after Jones took the oath of office — represents a fledgling legal strategy where people who say they were victimized long ago are litigating their claims through defamation lawsuits. The strategy allows them to proceed even after the statute of limitations has run out for criminal charges or for lawsuits seeking damages for sexual abuse, as it has in Corfman’s case.      The defamation suit against Trump was brought by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on the reality show “The Apprentice” who says he kissed and groped her in 2007. During the 2016 campaign, Trump called the claims by multiple women that he had touched them improperly “big lies,” and he called the women “liars.” A judge in New York State Supreme Court is weighing Trump’s motion to dismiss the case.      Zervos’s attorney, Gloria Allred, has said that a defamation case she and attorney Mariann Meier Wang settled in New York in 2015 is “an important precedent.” In that case, two former ballboys accused a Syracuse University basketball coach of defaming them after they spoke up about alleged sexual abuse.      Allred also represents a woman who accused Moore of kissing and groping her when she was 16 years old. At a news conference, Beverly Young Nelson produced her high school yearbook containing an inscription she said was written by Moore to prove that he knew her, though she later acknowledged adding the location, date and initials “D.A.” after the signature.      Comedian Bill Cosby has also been sued for defamation in cases that involve allegations of abuse years ago. A federal judge in Pennsylvania last year tossed out a suit filed by a woman who said Cosby defamed her in the media after she accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her. A separate defamation lawsuit, filed in 2014 by several women who say Cosby sexually assaulted them, is pending in Massachusetts. Yet another defamation case, filed against Cosby in 2015 by former supermodel Janice Dickinson, is pending in the California courts.      Under a landmark Supreme Court ruling, the legal standard for defamation of a public figure is that the statements were known to be false or showed a “reckless disregard for the truth,” experts say. The standard is lower for defaming a private individual — negligence toward the truth — though Corfman’s suit claims Moore’s comments meet the higher standard.      Corfman’s lawsuit cites numerous negative comments made by Moore and five top campaign allies, including campaign manager Rich Hobson, who announced Wednesday that he is running for Congress.

Ever since Jimmy Carter won his way to the White House in 1976 by assuring voters that they could trust him in contrast to the more experienced opponents he faced, both Republican and Democratic candidates have tended to boast about every part of their resume that can distinguish themselves from the Washington status quo.  In 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama undercut the \\"inevitable\\" Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by running as the candidate who was the least corrupted by the bargaining ways of Capitol Hill. Through its portrayal of Sen. John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin, the HBO film \\"Game Change\\" effectively captures just how far political candidates are willing to go to have this appeal.  This year, the story is the same. Although President Obama is boasting of his accomplishments in the White House as the nation's leader, he is also using Congress as a foil to lambaste the way that the \\"real\\" insiders in the capital do their business. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have tried to transform themselves from pillars of the congressional Republican establishment into conservative mavericks, while front-runner Mitt Romney talks frequently about how he would bring the skills of a CEO to Washington.  The problem is that doing well in Washington requires a very different kind of skill set than the ones that business executives or mavericks bring to the table. Each of these claims is flawed -- as Obama himself discovered -- given the world in which presidents must operate.  Presidents govern in a porous world that makes every move and decision visible to the public within a relatively short time span. Constant scrutiny from the media means the president essentially works inside glass walls.  Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. When was Carter elected? 2. What did he tell voters about himself? 3. Are presidents constantly being evaluated by the media? 4. Obama claimed to be less corrupted than who? 5. When was that? 6. Was Hillary the Republican nominee? 7. What was the political movie about Palin? 8. What are both party's candidates tried to be different from? 9. What was Obama's job in 2008? 10.

About the only real downside to regular exercise is the transient toll it takes on the body after a hard training session. The pain and soreness after training needs sufficient time to recover from before another hard session can be performed. A very plausible theory pushed for many years is that the post-exercise oxidative stress in the body is the primary cause of the muscle damage and fatigue experienced. If you could reduce this oxidative stress, then it would allow quicker recovery, and then more time spent training. What this theory ignores though is that oxidative damage is a natural part of how the body adapts to stressful exercise, allowing the body to repair and grow stronger to allow higher levels of performance in the future. A small scale study has previously found that trained and untrained individuals who dose up on antioxidant supplements impair important exercise training adaptations such as improved insulin sensitivity and production of oxidative stress defence proteins. Now researchers have extended this study by looking at the effect of antioxidants in trained female runners, and published their findings in the European Journal of Sports Science. Twenty-three well trained female runners took part in three separate 3-week training blocks where they took either 1 gram of vitamin C, blackcurrant juice, or a placebo drink for each of the training blocks. Each of the dietary interventions involved drinking a similar volume of fruit drink of a total of half a litre per day split over the morning and evening. The training performance of each runner was carefully measured at the beginning and end of each 3-week treatment period. The runners stuck to a set training schedule which allowed a more accurate assessment of any changes in performance over the training period.

This style of art emerged as a reaction against the established Impressionist movement, and sought to delve deeper into the emotional and intellectual aspects of art. Van Gogh’s work distinctly showcased his personal experiences and emotions through an innovative blend of color, form, and texture. Van Gogh's art is characterized by several unique features that set it apart from the works of his contemporaries: 1. Bold use of color: Deviating from the traditional palette, Van Gogh employed bright, vivid, and high-contrast colors in his paintings. This choice reflected his desire to use colors both symbolically and emotionally, aiming to elicit deep feelings in the viewer. For instance, the vibrant yellows in \\"Sunflowers\\" exude warmth and optimism, while the darker blues in \\"The Starry Night\\" evoke a sense of mystery and vastness. 2. Expressive brushwork: Van Gogh's paintings are widely recognized for their dynamic and energetic brushstrokes. These intense strokes convey a sense of movement and tension in his work. Often using thick, impasto layers of paint, Van Gogh further emphasized the emotional qualities of his paintings through tactile and three-dimensional effects. In \\"Wheatfield with Crows,\\" the violence of the brushwork adds a sense of turbulence and unease to the landscape. 3. Evolution of subject matter: Throughout his artistic career, Van Gogh explored various themes, including still life, portraiture, landscapes, and scenes from everyday life. His subject matter evolved from dark and somber works like \\"The Potato Eaters\\" to more colorful and emotionally charged pieces such as \\"Irises\\" and \\"Café Terrace at Night.\\" Van Gogh's art reveals his fascination with the natural world, his fellow humans, and his personal search for meaning and solace. 4. Symbolic representations: Van Gogh was deeply invested in incorporating symbolism into his work, often infusing objects and scenes with greater meaning. He used various elements to provide a deeper understanding of his thoughts and emotions, such as the swirling stars in \\"The Starry Night\\" to depict the turbulent nature of the universe or the organic shapes in \\"Almond Blossoms\\" to represent life, hope, and renewal. 5. Emotional intensity: One of the critical aspects of Van Gogh's art is its strong emotional charge. His paintings capture the artist's emotional state at the time of creation, resulting in deeply personal and often haunting works. The intensity of the colors, the vigorous brushstrokes, and the unconventional compositions all combine to create a style that conveys raw emotion and intensity. In conclusion, Van Gogh played a vital role in the evolution of modern art through his innovative and distinctive approach to Post-Impressionism. His bold use of color, expressive brushwork, diverse subject matter, symbolic representations, and emotional intensity remains a significant influence on generations of artists and continues to captivate the imagination of art enthusiasts worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: What is Bugs Bunny's final destination? Movie title: Ali Baba Bunny Movie plot: In the middle of the Arabian Desert, a rich Sultan has stored all his treasure in a cave and is leaving his guard Hassan to watch the cave. As the Sultan leaves, the trail of a burrowing rabbit crosses the desert towards the cave. Hassan spots the burrow tunneling under the entrance of the cave and attempts to chase out the intruders, but has trouble remembering the command to open the door. Inside the cave, Bugs Bunny and his traveling companion Daffy Duck emerge from the burrow, believing they have arrived at Pismo Beach. Daffy's complaints about travelling underground (\\"What a way for a duck to travel; underground!\\") and that they're at the wrong place are silenced when he spots the riches. Determined to keep it all for himself, he stomps repeatedly on Bugs to force him back into the burrow. Meanwhile, Hassan finally says the correct command to open the door and marches in. He is met by Daffy, who is wheeling a cart full of loot. Mistaking Hassan for a \\"redcap\\" (porter), Daffy asks him to call a cab. In response, Hassan brings his sword down on Daffy's head, splitting in half both the diamond-adorned hat he is wearing and a single feather underneath. Daffy chuckles nervously before he flees in terror and uses a large gem to try bribing Bugs into saving him, but Bugs is only concerned with dusting himself off from the earlier abuse from Daffy. Hassan rushes towards them both, sword raised. Daffy hides and tells Hassan to chop the rabbit, but Bugs has disguised himself to be a genie in a bottle and fools Hassan with a rich offer for releasing him. Hassan does, taking no notice of Daffy's attempt to expose Bugs. Bugs tells Hassan the treasure is his to claim. Daffy sardonically mocks Bugs for allowing Hassan access to the treasure he wanted for himself. Outside the cave, Bugs surveys the desert and concludes he is in the wrong place. Suddenly, Daffy runs out of the cave carrying a large gem. Hassan is in hot pursuit, enraged over the duck's efforts to lay claim to the treasure. Daffy begs Bugs to save him,... The answer is:","output":"The final destination for Bugs Bunny in the movie \\"Ali Baba Bunny\\" is Pismo Beach. The reason for this conclusion is based on the information provided: Bugs Bunny and his traveling companion Daffy Duck emerge from the burrow in the middle of the Arabian Desert, mistakenly believing they have arrived at Pismo Beach. This indicates that their intended destination was Pismo Beach.

Article: More students than ever before are taking a gap-year  before going to university.It used to be called the \\"year off\\" between school and university.The gap-year phenomenon originated  with the months left over to Oxbridge applicants between entrance exams in November and the start of the next academic year. This year, 25,310 students who have accepted places in higher education institutions have put off their entry until next year, according to statistics on university entrance provided by University and College Admissions Serbice(UCAS). That is a record 14.7% increase in the number of students taking a gap year. Tony Higgins from UCAS  said that the statistics are good news for everyone in higher education. \\"Students who take a well-planned year out are more likely to be stisfied with, and complete, their chosen course. Students who take a gap year are often more mature and responsible,\\" he said. But not everyone is happy. Owain James, the president of the National Union of Students(NUS), argued that the increase is evidence of student hadship - young people are being forced into earning money before finishing their education. \\"New students are now aware that they are likely to leave university up to PS15,000 in debt.

Answer the following question: Question: The electric fan had gotten too loud and was bothering others, though they allowed many personal things on desks he was required to turn it off where? Options: - closet - hallway - hot room - home - office  The answer is \\"office\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"office\\" because the electric fan being too loud and bothersome to others directly pertains to the workplace environment. In an office setting, it is crucial to maintain a comfortable and peaceful atmosphere for everyone to be able to focus and work efficiently. Allowing too much noise or disturbance from personal items, such as an electric fan, can distract coworkers and ultimately affect productivity. In this scenario, the electric fan is being used by an individual at their desk within the office, and it is creating excessive noise that is bothering others. It is important to respect the professional setting and the comfort of each employee. Hence, the individual is required to turn off the fan, despite the allowance of personal items on their desk. Turning the fan off within the office would effectively resolve the noise issue and maintain a comfortable environment for all. Comparatively, other options such as the closet, hallway, hot room, or home do not directly address the issue of noise and disturbance within the workplace. Turning off the fan in a closet or hallway would not be practical, as it would not benefit the individual who requires the fan for their comfort. In addition, a hot room is most likely not a part of a typical office environment, and therefore, it would not be a suitable place to turn off the fan. Lastly, turning the fan off at home would not resolve the problem either, as the issue takes place within the office. In conclusion, the best option to address the problem of the electric fan generating excessive noise and distracting others is to turn it off within the office. This action respects the professional environment and ensures a comfortable and peaceful atmosphere for all employees. Other options like the closet, hallway, hot room, and home do not adequately address the disturbance caused by the fan in the office, making \\"office\\" the most suitable answer."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The root canal would hurt more, while the filling would hurt less. Before making a decision, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of each treatment option. Step 1: Understand the problem A cavity is the result of tooth decay, which causes damage to the tooth's structure. If left untreated, the decay can progress and potentially lead to more severe dental issues such as abscesses or tooth loss. Step 2: Conduct thorough research To make an informed decision, it's crucial to learn about both root canals and fillings. Consulting a dentist and researching reliable sources can provide valuable insight. Step 3: Evaluate the severity of the cavity Consider the extent of the cavity and its potential impact on overall dental health. Dentists can recommend the most appropriate treatment based on the severity of the problem. Step 4: Compare the treatments Now that we know more about root canals and fillings, let's compare them: - Root Canals: These procedures can save severely damaged teeth. The dentist removes the affected tissue, cleans and disinfects the canals, and seals the tooth. Root canals can be more painful and time-consuming than fillings. They are usually more expensive but can prevent tooth loss. - Fillings: Fillings are a common treatment for minor to moderate cavities. The dentist removes the decayed portion of the tooth and fills the cavity with a material such as composite resin or silver amalgam. Fillings are generally less painful and less expensive than root canals, but they might not be suitable for severe cases. Step 5: Consider personal factors Evaluate individual preferences such as pain tolerance, budget, and long-term dental health goals. These factors can help determine the right treatment. Step 6: Consult a dentist Before making a final decision, discuss your concerns and findings with a dentist. They can provide professional guidance tailored to your specific situation. Ultimately, the choice between a root canal or a filling will depend on various factors. By following these steps and seeking expert advice, you can make the best decision for your dental health."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

At the time, they weren't planning on making a sequel, and in their own words, were just hoping that the first movie would break even at the box office. This scene was just a sort of joke. Afterward, when the film was such a success that they were asked to write a script for a sequel, they regretted writing this scene the way that they did, because Doc and Marty brought Jennifer along, which limited their options in writing the next script. If it has just been Doc and Marty, they could have made the next movie about anything they wanted, the two guys on any crazy adventure in time. With Jennifer around (and what Doc said), the second movie now had to be about their kids.

Write a \\"[1].\\" movie review (Select from: [1]. negative. [2]. positive.).","output":"I will write a negative movie review for \\"Extraterrestrial Beings: The Attack\\" (a fictional movie). Title: Extraterrestrial Beings: The Attack - A Lackluster Invasion 1. Introduction: \\"Extraterrestrial Beings: The Attack\\" had the potential to be a thrilling sci-fi action film about a battle between humanity and alien invaders. Unfortunately, it falls short of expectations due to poor character development, lackluster action sequences, and an unoriginal plot. 2. Poor Character Development: The film's characters feel shallow and one-dimensional. The audience is never given enough time to truly understand the protagonist's motivations or care about the people fighting for their lives. This lack of connection weakens the impact of the story. 3. Lackluster Action Sequences: For a movie centered around an alien invasion, the action scenes are surprisingly dull. The CGI is unconvincing, and the fight choreography leaves much to be desired. Many moments meant to be awe-inspiring or thrilling simply fall flat, failing to elicit any excitement or tension from the audience. 4. Unoriginal Plot: \\"Extraterrestrial Beings: The Attack\\" relies heavily on clichés and tired tropes that have been seen in countless other invasion films. The result is a predictable and uninspiring story that offers little in the way of innovation or surprise. 5. Conclusion: While \\"Extraterrestrial Beings: The Attack\\" had the potential to breathe new life into the alien invasion genre, its shortcomings ultimately result in a lackluster and forgettable moviegoing experience. Fans of science fiction and action films are better off looking elsewhere for their fix of thrilling battles and well-developed characters."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

FORT WORTH — Early this month, Wendy Davis, the unknown Texas state senator who rocketed to fame this summer with her 11-hour filibuster to block an anti-abortion bill, met with strategists of the Democratic Governors Association at their K Street offices in Washington. They were urging her to run for governor next year, even though Texas is not among their realistic targets for flipping a Republican-held executive mansion.      All around Ms. Davis, people are encouraging her to get in the governor’s race. Whether she can win seems beside the point.      Liberal groups in Texas are hungry for her star power to energize the moribund state Democratic Party. Political operatives smell the money that a richly financed Democratic campaign, which early estimates put at 40 million, would direct their way. And national Democrats know a Davis campaign would force the Republican Governors Association to divert millions from more competitive races in Ohio, Florida and Michigan to the Lone Star State.      “The R.G.A. would probably have to waste resources there, which is compelling to us,” said an official of the Democratic group, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly.      Ms. Davis, tuning out the self-interested chorus, has spent August engaging in a private inquiry into the viability of a race for which independent analysts put the chances of her success somewhere between a long shot and a pipe dream. On Thursday she said she would announce her decision in a few weeks — a decision she postponed because she is caring for her father, who is hospitalized with complications from surgery, she said in a statement.      What trusted advisers, pollsters, fund-raisers and friends are telling her, they said in interviews, is that there is a path to victory, even in Texas, where no Democrat has won statewide office in nearly two decades.      “My impression was she was very interested,” said Martin Frost, a Washington lobbyist and former Texas congressman whose counsel Ms. Davis sought. “You don’t get these opportunities very often. She’s 50 years old. This is the right time for her.”      In her most recent public appearance, she sounded very much like a candidate on the verge. She was “very, very seriously considering” a campaign, she told an audience in San Francisco two weeks ago. She added, “I really think hard things are worth fighting for.”      That sentiment echoed what aides have identified as the best way for Ms. Davis to position herself — as a fighter for her beliefs — and deflect Republican efforts to narrowly define her as a defender of late-term abortion.      Researchers presented Ms. Davis with private polling that showed she was better known for her personality than for her positions. They also prepared an analysis of the nearly 900,000 Twitter messages in the 24 hours around her filibuster in June, which temporarily halted a bill to ban abortion in Texas after 20 weeks. A high percentage of those messages focused on her physical ordeal.      “Probably the biggest benefit of this filibuster is Wendy is known statewide and she’s known as a fighter, and that plays very well in Texas,” said Matt Angle, an adviser to Ms. Davis.      Republicans are moving swiftly to peg Ms. Davis, whose celebrity was confirmed this month by a Vogue magazine spread, as someone out of step with the state’s conservative electorate.      “God, I hope she runs, it’ll be great,” said Dave Carney, a consultant to Attorney General Greg Abbott, the most likely Republican nominee. “I don’t see her brand of populism, which is beautifully accepted on the Left Coast and the Acela Corridor, being a selling job in Texas.”      Ms. Davis has sought to broaden her identity, emphasizing a life story that few members of the coastal elites would identify with. Raised by a mother with a sixth-grade education after her father left, she became a single mother herself, living in a mobile home. She worked her way through community college, won a scholarship to Texas Christian University and eventually graduated from Harvard Law School.      She served nine years on the Fort Worth City Council before defeating a Republican incumbent for the State Senate in 2008. In Austin, her shoulder-length blond mane inspired jokes that she was the only politician with better hair than Gov. Rick Perry.      Much of Ms. Davis’s due diligence in eyeing a run has involved sifting the results of past statewide Texas races. The numbers are daunting: President Obama lost the state by 16 points in November. The 2010 Democratic nominee for governor pulled only 42 percent.      But Ms. Davis’s number crunchers are telling her, in essence, that if she can win her Senate district — much of Fort Worth and its suburbs — she can win statewide. It is the only district out of 31 in the state that is a true battleground, not drawn to protect one of the parties. ||||| Rising Democratic star Wendy Davis continues to be a major grassroots fundraising force.      According to campaign finance reports filed this week, the Texas state senator netted 1.2 million in the six weeks following her June filibuster against an abortion bill being considered by the Texas legislature.      Text Size -      +      reset Wendy Davis's filibuster      The 13-hour marathon filibuster and its aftermath — which drew national media attention — immediately catapulted the 50 year-old lawmaker into the spotlight and prompted calls from supporters for a statewide run.      (QUIZ: Do you know Wendy Davis?)      According to a POLITICO analysis of her campaign finance report, Davis raised most of her funds from small donors. She reported almost 24,000 individual donors — with an average donation to her campaign of about 52. About 60 percent of her funds came from inside the Lone Star State.      Her largest individual donor was Fort Worth investor and businessman Sid Bass, who gave 100,000.      The Texas-based group Annie’s List also contributed 50,000 to her state senate campaign. The group launched a grassroots effort earlier this month to encourage Davis to run for the governorship.      (PHOTOS: Wendy Davis’s filibuster)      Most of her largest donors are in-state. Of the 10 individual donors who gave more than 10,000 to her campaign, only one was out of state.      Other big donors to her campaign include Houston attorney Laura Arnold, oil executive Lee Fikes and Marguerite Hoffman, wife of the businessman and National Lampoon co-founder Robert Hoffman. All gave 10,000 to her efforts.      Davis has done some out-of-state fundraising as well, with a late July swing into Washington, D.C., for a small donor event.      Davis said she will decide whether she wants to run for the open Texas governship next month, where Texas attorney general Greg Abbott has amassed more than 20 million. If she passes on the governor’s race, she has vowed to run for reelection as a state senator.      News of Davis’ fundraising numbers was first reported by several Texas media outlets. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Wendy Davis, a Texas state senator who gained fame for her 11-hour filibuster to block an anti-abortion bill, has been receiving encouragement from various groups to run for governor. Though her chances of winning are considered slim by independent analysts, her potential campaign could force the Republican Governors Association to divert millions from more competitive races to Texas. Davis has sought advice from numerous trusted advisers, pollsters, fundraisers, and friends, and her decision on whether she will run for governor will be announced in a few weeks. In six weeks following her filibuster, Davis has netted 1.2 million, with her average donation amount from individual donors being about 52."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He could see that she was frightened, standing out there in the cold. He knew how she felt. He said, \\"I am here to help you, ma'am. Why don't you wait in the car where it's warm? By the way, my name is Bryan Anderson.\\" Well, all she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady, that was bad enough. Bryan crawled under the car looking for a place to put the jack, skinning his knuckles a time or two. Soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt. As he was tightening up the lug nuts, she rolled down the window and began to talk to him. She told him that she was from St. Louis and was just passing through. She couldn't thank him enough for coming to her aid. Bryan just smiled as he closed her trunk. The lady asked how much she owed him. Any amount would have been all right with her. She already imagined all the awful things that could have happened, had he not stopped. Bryan never thought twice about being paid. This was not a job to him. This was helping someone in need, and God knows there were many people who had given him a hand in the past. He had lived his whole life that way, and it never occurred to him to act any other way. He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the assistance they needed, and Bryan added, \\"And think of me.\\" He waited until she started her car and drove off.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The greatest recent social changes have been in the lives of women. During the twentieth century there has been a remarkable shortening of the proportion of a woman's life spent in caring for the children. A woman marrying at the end of the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children, four or five of whom lived till they were five years old. By the time the youngest was fifteen, the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years, during which health made it unusual for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five years and can be expected to live another thirty-five years and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty. Even while she has to take care of children, her work is lightened by modern living conditions. This important change in women's life-patterns has only recently begun to have its full effect on women's economic position. Even a few years ago most girls took a full-time job after they left school. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and never returned to it. Today the school- leaving age is sixteen; many girls stay at school after that age, and though women usually marry older, more married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born. Many more afterwards return to full-or-part-time work. Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage, with the husband accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfactions of family life, and with both husband and wife sharing more equally in providing the money, and running the home, according to the abilities and interests of each of them. Question: When she was over fifty, a late nineteenth-century mother   _  .

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who voted Solti's recording of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen the greatest recording ever made in 2011?  Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine.

Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. x = 6, equation weights = [6, 8, 4] Output:","output":"Part #1: Identify the polynomial equation from the given weights. Usage: equation weights = [6, 8, 4] would represent the equation 6x^2 + 8x + 4. The weights list shows the different coefficients of each term, in descending order of powers of x. This means 6 is the weight of x^2, 8 is the weight of x, and 4 is the constant term. Part #2: Substituting the given value of x in the polynomial equation. Usage: x = 6, equation weights = [6, 8, 4] represents the equation 6x^2 + 8x + 4. Substitute the value x = 6 into the equation to get 6*(6^2) + 8*(6) + 4. Part #3: Compute the result of the polynomial expression Usage: For the equation 6x^2 + 8x + 4 and x = 6; 6*(6^2) + 8*(6) + 4 = 6*(36) + 48 + 4 = 216 + 48 + 4 = 268.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: He was born James Lablache Stewart in Old Brompton Road, Kensington, West London, the only son of Major James Stewart, OBE and his wife Frederica Eliza (nee Lablache). Granger was educated at Epsom College and the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. He was the great-great-grandson of the opera singer Luigi Lablache and the grandson of the actor Luigi Lablache. When he became an actor, he was advised to change his name in order to avoid being confused with the American actor James Stewart. Granger's first starring film role was as the acid-tongued Rokeby in the Gainsborough Pictures period melodrama, The Man in Grey (1943), a film that helped to make him and his three co-stars - James Mason, Phyllis Calvert and Margaret Lockwood - into box office names in Britain.  Granger followed it with The Lamp Still Burns (1943) playing the love interest of nurse Rosamund John. More popular was another for Gainsborough Pictures, Fanny by Gaslight (1944), which reunited him with Calvert and Mason, and added Jean Kent. The New York Times reported that Granger \\"is a young man worth watching. The customers... like his dark looks and his dash; he puts them in mind, they say of Cary Grant.\\" It was the second most popular film at the British box office in 1944.  Another hit was Love Story (1944) where he plays a blind pilot who falls in love with terminally ill Margaret Lockwood, with Patricia Roc co-starring. Granger filmed this at the same time as Waterloo Road (1945), playing his first villain, a \\"spiv\\" who has run off with the wife of John Mills. This film was popular too, and it is one of Granger's favourites.  Madonna of the Seven Moons (1945), with Calvert and Roc, was more Gainsborough melodrama, another hit. Also popular was Caesar and Cleopatra, supporting Claude Rains and Vivien Leigh; this film lost money because of its high production cost but was widely seen, and was the first of Granger's films to be a hit in the USA. At the end of 1945 British exhibitors voted Granger the second-most popular British film star, and the ninth-most popular overall. The Times reported that \\"this six-foot black-visaged ex-soldier from the Black Watch is England's Number One pin up boy. Only Bing Crosby can match him for popularity.\\"  Caravan (1946), starring Granger and Kent, was the sixth most popular film at the British box office in 1946. Also well liked was The Magic Bow (1946), with Calvert and Kent, where Granger played Niccolo Paganini That year he was voted the third-most popular British star, and the sixth-most popular overall.

Movie title: Twister Movie plot: In June 1969, 5-year-old Jo Thornton (Alexa Vega), her parents, and the family dog Toby seek shelter in their family storm cellar as a powerful F5 tornado hits their farm in Oklahoma. This tornado is so strong that the storm cellar door is ripped off, causing Jo's father (Richard Lineback) to be pulled into the storm to his death. Jo, her mother (Rusty Schwimmer), and Toby survive. 27 years later in 1996, 32-year-old Jo (Helen Hunt), now a meteorologist, is reunited with her estranged husband, Bill \\"The Extreme\\" Harding (Bill Paxton), a former weather researcher and storm chaser, who has since become a weather reporter. He is planning to marry reproductive therapist Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz). They need Jo's signature on the divorce papers and have tracked her down during an active bout of stormy weather. Jo has built four identical tornado research devices called DOROTHY, based on Bill's designs. The device is designed to release hundreds of sensors into the center of a tornado to study its structure from the inside, with the purpose of creating a more advanced storm warning system. Bill and Melissa join Jo and her team of storm chasers, and the team encounters Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes), a smug, corporate-funded meteorologist and storm chaser. When Bill discovers that Jonas has created a device based on DOROTHY, called DOT-3, he vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Miller can claim credit for the idea. During the first tornado, Jo's truck and DOROTHY I are both destroyed (the truck is picked up and lands upside-down). They continue storm chasing in Bill's truck, with Melissa in the back seat. They find a second tornado, a confirmed F2, and head off on a back road when the twister shifts its track. They soon find themselves driving through heavy rain, and instead collide with a cluster of two violent waterspouts, one of which splits, spinning them around on the highway until the waterspouts dissipate. They're fine, but Melissa becomes hysterical from the ordeal, and Bill has to calm her down. The team...

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Battery-Eater Product review: Bet the designed circuit or the one that I bought has problem. It is a battery eater even it is off. Every few days batteries have to be replaced even it hasn't been used if I don't take the batteries outta it. So far my battery cost more than this camera. The answer is:","output":"The given review would decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons.  First and foremost, the reviewer mentions that the product in question consumes batteries rapidly, even when it is turned off. This is a significant concern for potential buyers, as excessive battery consumption can lead to increased costs in the long run, as the reviewer states that the cost of batteries has exceeded the cost of the camera itself. This indicates that the product may not be energy-efficient and could potentially lead to more frequent battery replacements than expected, which can be both inconvenient and less cost-effective for the user. Secondly, the reviewer suggests that the product's design or the specific unit they purchased might have a problem with the circuitry. This remark brings up concerns about the product's overall quality and reliability, as well as the potential for manufacturing defects that could affect the product's performance and longevity. A potential buyer might be hesitant to buy the product, given that there may be issues with its internal components, leading to possible malfunctions or even a shorter lifespan than expected. Lastly, while the reviewer's experience may or may not be representative of the product as a whole, such negative reviews can still create a sense of doubt and uncertainty in the minds of potential buyers. If numerous other reviews echo similar sentiments, this particular review could further deter buyers from purchasing the product, as they may perceive it as a less reliable, lower quality option when compared to other products available in the same category. In conclusion, the given review would decrease the chances of buying the product due to concerns regarding excessive battery consumption, potential problems with the product's design or manufacturing, and doubts about the product's overall quality and reliability. It is essential for potential buyers to thoroughly review both positive and negative reviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of the product and its performance before making an informed decision on whether or not to buy it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After recording the A Fire Inside EP (1998), Stopholese left the band and was replaced by Jade Puget, former member of Influence 13 and vocalist Havok's close friend. The band then recorded Black Sails in the Sunset (1999), a musical turning point which introduced AFI fans to a much darker sound, mixing the band's original hardcore roots with dark romantic influences (a poem by Charles Baudelaire, \\"De profundis clamavi,\\" is present in the hidden track \\"Midnight Sun\\") and an emphasis on a more somber atmosphere and lyrics. The New York Times later referred to this as the point where Havok \\"developed into a singer and songwriter of substance\\". The influence of the deathrock and goth rock scenes was also apparent. During this period, AFI's style was considered the band's gothic punk rock style. Offspring frontman Dexter Holland was featured as a backing vocalist on two tracks: \\"Clove Smoke Catharsis\\" and \\"The Prayer Position\\".  The All Hallow's E.P. (October 5, 1999) further explored the horror punk genre, featuring artwork and lyrics containing Halloween themes. The EP spawned the single \\"Totalimmortal\\", a track later covered by The Offspring for the Me, Myself and Irene soundtrack. It received a fair amount of radio play and exposed AFI to larger audiences. \\"The Boy Who Destroyed the World\\" from the All Hallows EP was featured in the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 video game. All Hallow's also featured a cover of the Misfits song \\"Halloween\\".  On September 19, 2000, AFI released The Art of Drowning, which debuted on the Billboard Charts at number 174, and peaked at number 9 on the Heatseekers chart. It continued to touch base with the horror punk genre, but expanded into styles that were a departure from previous works. The album featured slower, more melodic songs that were more reminiscent of alternative rock, such as \\"Ever and a Day\\" and \\"6 to 8\\". Still, the presence of hardcore influences was imminent in most of the album, flaunted most on tracks like \\"Smile\\", \\"The Lost Souls\\", and \\"Catch a Hot One\\". The album brought the band unprecedented success in the underground scene, selling in excess of 100,000 copies. \\"The Days of the Phoenix\\" was released as a single and video and, like \\"Totalimmortal,\\" had some moderate mainstream success, garnering the band more TV and radio airplay. The song even managed to reach the UK Singles Chart with its titular EP in 2001, peaking at number 152. The success of The Art of Drowning helped to encourage the band to pursue higher mainstream notoriety. Answer this question \\"Any singles released off these albums ?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, there were singles released off these albums. \\"Totalimmortal\\" from the All Hallow's E.P. and \\"The Days of the Phoenix\\" from The Art of Drowning are two singles mentioned in the text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When thirty-two-year-old tennis player Andre Agassi made to the final of the U.S. Clay Court Championship in April 2003, he set a new world record: he became the oldest player ever to be number one in the world's tennis rankings. It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times. Which statement is right about Agassi? A) He was always lucky to win the championship. B) He was the youngest player ever to be number one in the world's tennis rankings. C) He took part in Wimbledon in 1987. D) His wife is a dancer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What is not prominent? Context: Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration. The answer is:","output":"The prominent feature that is not present in most birds, particularly in Neoaves, is a penis.

On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition.

He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work.

For example, \\"---How do you know that Sid and Nancy have separated ?\\" \\"---I heard it on the grapevine \\". Of course, the second speaker does not mean he heard the news about John by putting his ear to a grapevine! He is conveying the idea visually of information spreading around a widespread network, similar to a grapevine. We use idioms to express something that other words do not express as clearly or as cleverly. We often use an image or symbol to describe something as clearly as possible and thus make our point as effectively as possible. For example, \\"in a nutshell\\" suggests the idea of having all the information contained within very few words. Idioms tend to be informal and are best used in spoken rather than written English. One of the best ways to learn an idiom is by looking at the context in which it is used. This can be done by concentrating on the rest of the sentence and try to guess the meaning. Many idioms are not that difficult to understand when considered in their context. For example: We are going to have a surprise party for Tom tomorrow. It's a secret so please don't let the cat out of the bag. 'Let the cat out of the bag' is an idiom. Imagine you don't know what this idiom means; by looking at the words preceding, it should be easy to guess that the speaker does not want you to tell Tom about the surprise party. Therefore, 'let the cat out of the bag' must mean something like' reveal a secret' or 'tell a secret'. Answer:","output":"What is an idiom? a) A group of words with a different meaning when used together than the individual words  b) A single word that functions as a metaphor c) An informal way of speaking in the English language d) A secret code used among friends"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what language do they speak in thai?\\" The answer to this question is:","output":"The primary language spoken in Thailand is Thai, also known as Siamese or Phasa Thai. Thai is the official language and is the native language of the majority of the population. It belongs to the Tai-Kadai language family and is a member of the Chiang Saeng branch of the Southwestern group of Tai languages. Thai is a tonal language with five distinct tones, which are used to convey different meanings for the same word. The Thai script, which is derived from the ancient Khmer script, consists of 44 consonants, 15 vowel symbols, and four tone marks, making it an abugida system. There are four main dialects of Thai, which are as follows: 1. Central Thai: This is the standard Thai dialect and is spoken by the majority of the population. It is used in official settings, education, and media, and is based on the speech of the educated classes in Bangkok, the capital city. 2. Northern Thai (Lanna): Spoken primarily in the northern region of Thailand, Northern Thai has its own script, which is a derivative of the ancient Mon script. The dialect has some similarities to the standard Thai language but also displays influences from the local languages of the region. 3. Northeastern Thai (Isan): Spoken by the inhabitants of the Isan region, this dialect is closely related to the Lao language spoken in Laos. Isan has its own script, which is a combination of the Thai and Lao scripts. While Isan speakers can understand standard Thai, there are distinct differences in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. 4. Southern Thai (Pak Tai): Spoken in the southern provinces of Thailand, Southern Thai is characterized by its distinctive vocabulary, which has absorbed influences from the Malay and Mon languages. Southern Thai has its own unique pronunciation and stress patterns. In addition to the Thai language, there are several other minority languages spoken in Thailand. Many ethnic groups, such as the Chines, Malays, and various hill tribes, maintain their distinct languages and dialects. Some of these languages include Chinese (particularly the Teochew and Hakka dialects), Malay, Khmer, Hmong, Karen, Lisu, and Lahu. English is also widely spoken among educated Thais, particularly in urban areas, and it is taught as a second language in schools. English is commonly used in the tourism industry, and many Thais who work in the tourism sector have a good grasp of the language. In summary, the primary language spoken in Thailand is Thai, with several dialects and minority languages coexisting alongside the official language. English is frequently spoken as a second language, especially in larger cities and tourist destinations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) is a hapless, stay-at-home mother in a small suburban Boston community. She had been working on a doctorate in English, but set aside her work to marry Richard (Gregg Edelman) and raise their 3-year-old daughter, Lucy (Sadie Goldstein). Her marriage falls apart when she discovers that Richard is addicted to online pornography. She meets Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), a law student who brings his 4-year-old son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. Although Brad's marriage to Katherine (Jennifer Connelly) is loving and amicable, it has been lacking intimacy.When he is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, Brad instead plays on a local football team or sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again. Brad and Sarah become friendly and, on a dare, kiss in the park, scandalizing the other park parents. They are instantly attracted to each other, but resolve to keep their relationship platonic. One day, several parents panic when they see Ronald \\"Ronnie\\" McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), a sex offender who was recently released from prison, swimming in the pool with the children. After Ronnie is escorted away by two police officers, it begins to rain.Sarah and Brad take Lucy and Aaron back to her house and put the kids to bed. Brad looks at one of Sarah's books and finds a photo of him in it. While Sarah is drying towels in her basement, Brad kisses her and they have sex. Brad's friend Larry (Noah Emmerich) is a former police officer who was forced to retire when he accidentally shot a teenager at a local shopping mall. Now he is estranged from his wife and spends much of his time harassing Ronnie. Ronnie lives with his mother, May (Phyllis Somerville), who believes that meeting a woman his own age would cure him of his pedophilia. Ronnie knows this is futile, but agrees to on a date May has arranged for him with a woman named Sheila (Jane Adams).During dinner, Ronnie tells Sheila about his criminal record, and Sheila in return tells him that she has had a series of nervous breakdowns. They seem to get on well, but the date ends badly when he has her drive by an elementary school playground so he can masturbate next to her in the car. When Brad skips taking the bar exam again, Kathy grows suspicious and tells Brad to invite Sarah, Richard, and Lucy over for dinner. The intimacy evident between Brad and Sarah confirms her suspicions, and Kathy arranges for her mother to come for an extended visit so Brad and Sarah can't see one another anymore. When Brad's football team plays its final game, Sarah attends and cheers as Brad scores the winning touchdown.Afterwards, while Larry waits for Brad at a nearby bar to celebrate their victory, Brad and Sarah make out on the field. He admits that this is the happiest moment of his life, and convinces Sarah to run away with him. Larry goes to Ronnie's house and wakes the neighborhood up by using a bullhorn to taunt him. May comes out to confront him and has a heart attack. Larry is arrested and May taken to the hospital. While Ronnie sleeps in the waiting room, May dies. When Ronnie goes home, he finds an envelope containing a letter written by his mother saying: \\"Please be a good boy.\\" Distraught, Ronnie destroys much of his mother's collection of Hummel figurines, then takes a butcher knife from the kitchen.That same night, Sarah and Brad agree to rendezvous through the park to run away together. Brad tells Aaron he loves him before putting him to bed, writes Kathy a note explaining why he is leaving her, then sneaks out while she and her mother finish the dishes. Before he can get to the park, he is distracted by skateboarding teenagers, who convince him to try a jump himself. Brad does so, but falls and knocks himself out. When he regains consciousness, he asks the paramedics to call his wife and to meet him at the hospital. It turns out that he never left the note for her and tells one of the skateboarders to dispose of it for him.When Sarah takes Lucy to the park, she sees Ronnie stagger by, and briefly feels afraid. When she sees him crying about his mother's death, however, she feels sorry for him. When Lucy disappears, Sarah panics and rushes to find her, forgetting about Brad. After Sarah finds Lucy and puts her in the car, Sarah starts crying, realizing her getaway with Brad is just a fantasy. Larry is upset about having indirectly caused May's death. He genuinely wants to apologize to Ronnie, but when he finds Ronnie in the park, he discovers that he has castrated himself and is bleeding to death. Larry races him to the hospital, and they arrive just as Kathy meets Brad at the emergency room doors. Output:","output":"Question: Who plays the role of Sarah Pierce?

Pretending to be on his deathbed, Fox invites three former lovers to his Venetian palazzo for a final visit: penniless Princess Dominique (Capucine), fading movie star Merle McGill (Edie Adams), and Texas millionairess Mrs. Lone Star Crockett Sheridan (Susan Hayward). Accompanying Mrs. Sheridan is her spinster nurse, Sarah Watkins (Maggie Smith). By chance, each of the women brings Fox a timepiece as a present. The three women warily size each other up. Mrs. Sheridan boldly announces that the others might as well go home, as she is Fox's common-law wife, and they can expect to inherit nothing. However, when Sarah returns from a late-night date with McFly, she finds her employer dead of an overdose of sleeping pills, an apparent suicide. Police Inspector Rizzi (Adolfo Celi) investigates. Sarah knows that the pills Mrs. Sheridan had been taking are harmless fakes. McFly has already revealed to Sarah that Fox is perpetrating a charade, and that the final joke is to be the reading of the will, empowering McFly to choose the heir. She therefore suspects him not only of being the murderer, but also plotting to kill Fox. When she confronts McFly, he locks her in her room, telling her it is for her own safety. She manages to escape via a dumbwaiter and warns Fox. However, his displeased reaction puzzles her. He sends her back to her room. The next morning, Fox is found dead. McFly reveals that Fox was the killer of Sarah's employer. He was broke and wanted Mrs. Sheridan's fortune. Once McFly had figured it out (and more importantly, told Sarah), Fox realized it was all up and committed suicide. Sarah asks McFly to write her name down in the will as the heir of Fox's worthless estate as a souvenir, with Rizzi signing as a witness.

Their beneficial properties have been applied to mask unpleasant odors, attract the attention of other people, add flavor and aroma properties to prepared dishes, perfumes, and cosmetics, etc. Herbs and essential oils (EOs) have also been used in medicine because of their biological properties, such as larvicidal action, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidant, fungicide, and antitumor activities, and many more. Many EOs exhibit antimicrobial properties, which is extremely important in fields of science and industry, such as medicine, agriculture, or cosmetology.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Andy Roddick Begins U.S. Open Retirement Party In Style The Andy Roddick goodbye extravaganza continues. Roddick will play at least one more round at the U.S. Open after a 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 victory over Bernard Tomic under the lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium Friday evening. Of all the possible opponents for Roddick to ensure this wouldn’t be his final night match in Flushing, Tomic, the anti-Roddick, had to be high on the list. Roddick, 30 as of Thursday, is relentless, a hustler. Tomic, more than a decade Roddick’s junior, can sleepwalk through entire sets. Roddick thinks about his opponents and their tendencies and tries to counteract them. Tomic, not so much. Roddick has lost six sets at love in his career, including two against Roger Federer and one against Rafael Nadal. Tomic, a former No. 1 junior and one of the game’s top young talents, had already lost three this year. Make that four. Still, Roddick said he had no idea how he would react to a familiar setting (he has played 27 night matches in Ashe, a stadium record) mixed with the unfamiliar circumstances of his looming retirement. Before the match, he caught a glimpse of a television montage of his career—likely set to “an 80s ballad,” he told the crowd afterward—and had to get away. “I had no idea what was going to happen out there honestly, even before the match,” he said. “That was a different kind of nerves than I’ve had before.” And then it was all too easy, this mini-celebration for Roddick and 24,000 supporters. The crowd cheered, Tomic barely resisted and those who dared to leave their seats for an undercooked pizza missed most of the match. Roddick said he took a few moments to look around the stadium. “When they’re doing the dancing and stuff on the switch overs I was just watching,” he said. “That was fun.” Tomic was listless. When told that John McEnroe thought he was “borderline not trying” in the third set, Tomic said, “Well, I think he’s probably right.” But when a reporter persisted with questions about tanking, Tomic asked for the reporter’s name and outlet (Reuters) and then said, “I’ll remember you.” Something Tomic would be better off remembering: He won five points in the third set. Total. Roddick won’t have such an easy time in the third round, but he could very well win the match. (The Journal’s Tennis Tracker likes his odds, anyway.) His opponent will be Fabio Fognini, the Italian known for his flashy strokes and frequent outbursts. After that, Roddick will need vintage performances to survive: He could meet Juan Martin del Potro in the fourth round. If he somehow wins that match, he’d likely face Novak Djokovic, the defending champion, in the quarterfinals. One thing Roddick has going for him, beyond the overwhelming support of fans: He’s not concerned about sore shoulders, achy knees or tired legs. When there’s no tomorrow, there are no consequences to overdoing it. His serve had more life Friday night than it has had in a long time – it was clocked as fast as 139 mph. “I haven’t hit these numbers in two years, what I’ve gotten in the last two matches,” Roddick said. “It didn’t feel very good after my first round, so we’ll see how it pulls up tomorrow. Come watch practice tomorrow. You’ll be equally unimpressed.” Undoubtedly, many people will do just that.","output":"The news article discusses the ongoing farewell tournament for Andy Roddick at the U.S. Open following his announcement of retiring from professional tennis. Roddick began his series of last performances with a robust win of 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 against Bernard Tomic under the stadium lights of the Arthur Ashe Stadium. Despite the 10-year age difference between Roddick and Tomic, Tomic, had a stark contrast in approach and performance compared to Roddick, which appeared to make the match favorable for Andy Roddick. Roddick's track record suggested a more driven and calculated game plan, while Tomic, despite his youth and past rankings, was showing more losses and less determination, a fact even acknowledged himself. The fact that this was a farewell tournament for Roddick brought a peculiar mix of familiarity and novelty. Roddick noted that the anticipation of the match came with a novel set of nerves. However, once the match started, Roddick and his supporters, found themselves effortlessly swept up in a mini celebration of Roddick’s illustrious career. Tomic’s listless performance made the match a comfortable win for Roddick. Roddick admitted to taking a moment to soak in the stadium ambiance amid the cheering crowd, which he found to be a fun experience. Meanwhile, despite Tomic’s less than stellar performance, he became defensive when a reporter from Reuters questioned his commitment during the match. Looking forward, Roddick's next opponent would be Fabio Fognini, known for his flashy playing style and frequent emotional outbursts. Despite the celebration of Roddick’s career, he acknowledged that the successful transmission to the next rounds will require him to perform at his peak. Potential obstacles include Juan Martin del Potro in the fourth round and possibly Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals.  However, Roddick seemed undeterred by physical challenges like aching limbs or exhaustion. He seemed determined to give his all in the tournament, given that he saw no consequences to overexerting himself, which was evident in his lively and high-speed serves. Regardless of the outcome, it was clear that his adoring fans would continue to support and cheer for him throughout his farewell tournament."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

(AP) — A first-time political candidate in northeast Arkansas has learned a valuable civics lesson: vote early.      Cliff Farmer didn't make it to the polls in time to vote Tuesday, and his race for a Hoxie City Council seat ended up as a tie.      The Jonesboro Sun reports Farmer and his wife were returning from a Florida vacation on Tuesday when their plane landed only an hour before polls closed. The plane landed in Memphis, Tennessee, which is 80 miles (130 kilometers) from Hoxie.      His wife voted early, but Farmer said he'd intended to vote after they returned.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery, partly because it cannot be detected  by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around but we can't detect them or sense them without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells in important organs. Even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and when they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years. This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. A child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. Question: Radiation can hurt us so much that it can   _  .

Coming off their win over the Bears, the Broncos returned home for an AFC duel with the New England Patriots on NBC's Sunday Night Football, on a snowy night in Denver. The Patriots, who entered the game with a 10-0 record, jumped out to a 14-0 lead, with quarterback Tom Brady tossing two touchdown passes &#8212; a 23-yarder to tight end Rob Gronkowski, followed in the second quarter by a 10-yarder to tight end Scott Chandler. The latter score occurred after Broncos' quarterback Brock Osweiler had a pass deflected and intercepted deep in Broncos' territory. The Broncos got on the scoreboard just before the two-minute warning, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 19-yard touchdown. The Broncos had a chance to cut into the Patriots' lead on their first possession of the second half, however, placekicker Brandon McManus missed wide-right on a 47-yard field goal attempt. Each team proceeded to trade punts on their next two offensive possessions, until Brady connected with wide receiver Brandon Bolden on a 63-yard touchdown pass at the beginning of the fourth quarter to give the Patriots a 21-7 lead. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out, and were forced to punt. However, Patriots' return specialist Chris Harper muffed the punt, which was recovered by Shaquil Barrett at the Patriots' 36-yard line, giving the Broncos new life. Four plays later, the Broncos pulled to within a one-touchdown deficit, with a 15-yard touchdown run by running back C. J. Anderson. The Broncos' defense forced a punt on the Patriots' next possession, which was aided by an offensive holding penalty on guard Tre' Jackson that nullified a 51-yard pass completion from Brady to wide receiver Keshawn Martin on a third-and-long play. The Broncos then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 21-yard field goal by McManus to pull to within 21-17 with 6:12 remaining in the fourth quarter. The two teams traded punts on their next possessions, and with 2:39 remaining and no timeouts, the Broncos forced a Patriots' punt. The Broncos marched down the field and were facing a 2nd-and-goal from the Patriots' 7-yard line, when Osweiler was sacked for an eight-yard loss. However, the sack was nullified by a defensive holding penalty on Patriots' safety Patrick Chung. On the very next play, the Broncos grabbed their first lead of the game, when Osweiler connected with wide receiver Andre Caldwell on a 4-yard touchdown with 1:15 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Patriots were not done yet, as Brady engineered a 5-play, 51-yard drive, which culminated with placekicker Stephen Gostkowski kicking a game-tying 47-yard field goal as time expired, sending the game to overtime. The Patriots won the overtime coin toss, but their offense went three-and-out. Following a Patriots' punt, the Broncos started their first overtime drive at their own 43-yard line, and three plays later, Anderson scampered down the sideline for a game-winning 48-yard touchdown run.

While President Barack Obama has made promoting rights for gays and lesbians worldwide a key foreign policy goal, that is little comfort to Ali Asseri, a former Saudi diplomat who is gay. Asseri is fighting a years-long battle for asylum in the United States, convinced his life will be in danger if he is forced to return home. The case presents a dilemma for the Obama administration as the President travels to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Abdullah amid a time of strained relations between the close allies. Saudi Arabia's radical form of Islam mandates the death penalty for same-sex relations. \\"I come from the darkest place on earth,\\" Asseri said in a phone interview from his home in West Hollywood. \\"We are brainwashed that we have the best system and sharia law comes from god. But they teach us to hate others. I came to America to clear my mind.\\" Asseri grew up in a middle class conservative Saudi family, the middle child with three brothers and three sisters. His parents had little education and raised him and his brothers and sisters true to Saudi culture and religion. There was no music or TV. He didn't know for years that he was gay. By age 13, he realized he was different than other boys his age, he just had no idea what that difference was. \\"We don't have any education about sex. You don't know what gay means. You just know that you have feelings. You can't talk about it with anyone. According to the Koran they are a sin. I thought it would just go away. I just had feelings but you can't talk about it with any person.\\" As a law student, he considered a career as an attorney and took a job as a clerk for a judge in the Saudi court. After a few months, he quit. In a petition seeking asylum to the United States obtained by CNN, he wrote that \\"unfair bias\\" in the treatment of cases in Saudi Arabia made it \\"morally impossible for me to continue.\\" \\"I was frequently upset and saddened by the system in general and the punishments given to the accused,\\" he wrote. Investigates sexuality. For another year he worked as a trainee in the Bureau of Investigation and Prosecution, where he would check on the prisoners to see whether they were receiving proper treatment. He was forced by his managers to witness prisoners being lashed, which gave him bad dreams. He quit his job once again, frustrated with the harsh punishments and his inability to do anything to stop them. At that time he started to investigate his faith, religion and sexuality. \\"Without these jobs I wouldn't be the same person now,\\" he said. \\"I began to understand something isn't right about the way we practice religion. Something didn't feel good. I said to myself the only way you can have freedom is to be a diplomat and travel out of the country.\\" He joined the Foreign Ministry as a diplomat and got married to a Saudi woman, all the time hiding his feelings and dreaming of the day he could leave the country and live his life as an openly gay man. When his wife gave birth to his son, Fahad, Asseri tried one last time to give his arrangement a chance. But he found he could not keep up the charade and they divorced in 2004. Asseri was transferred to the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles the next year. A double life. Here, he writes in his asylum petition, \\"I discovered the gay community, the gay culture and that I was in fact gay.\\" For four years he led a double life. By day, he was a traditional diplomat. By night, he visited gay bars and told friends he was from Italy or any other country than his own. Asseri's two worlds collided in 2009 when he fell in love and moved into a West Hollywood apartment with his boyfriend. Finding happiness for the first time, he enjoyed an open social life in West Hollywood with his new friends. Soon his colleagues began to ask him about his life outside of work and started following him. When his passport expired and he submitted it for renewal, he received no reply. After several months, his office told him his time in the United States was up and he would have to return to Saudi Arabia. He began to fear he was found out. He called a friend in the foreign ministry in Riyadh, who told him indeed the Consul General sent a letter to the ministry stating he was gay and had information about his lifestyle. \\"This is when I became really scared and paranoid,\\" he writes in his asylum petition. \\"I was so scared they would do something to me physically. I was even afraid to go to my car thinking there could be a bomb in it. When I came home I had to check every closet.\\" He sent a letter to various news organizations saying he was being harassed by colleagues and he feared for his life. Fearing persecution. He applied for asylum as a gay person who would face persecution if sent home. In more than eight hours of questioning, immigration officers focused on his jobs in the Saudi courts and Bureau of investigation. His bid for asylum was no common occurrence. The last Saudi diplomat to seek asylum was in 1994, when Mohammed al-Khilewi, then first secretary for the Saudi mission to the United Nations, was granted asylum for publicly criticizing his country's human rights record and alleged support for terrorism. Fourteen months later in October 2011, the Department of Homeland Security denied Asseri's application. In the rejection letter, obtained by CNN, the government says \\"evidence indicates that you ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\\" The case went to automatic appeal. \\"They interviewed him once and it took 14 months and it showed they were going for denial,\\" says Ali Ahmed, a Saudi dissident and activist that has been helping Asseri with his case. \\"They used the reason that he worked for the courts to call him a human rights violator which is really bogus.\\" Obama on gay rights. Two months later, Obama signed a Memorandum on International Initiatives to Advance the Human Rights of LGBT Persons. It included a program to protect gay refugees and asylum seekers, including \\"ensuring the federal government has the ability to identify and expedite resettlement of highly vulnerable persons with urgent protection needs.\\" In the memo, Obama writes that the fight to end discrimination against LGBT people is \\"a global challenge\\" and \\"central to the United States' commitment to promoting human rights.\\" \\"I am deeply concerned by the violence and discrimination targeting LGBT persons around the world â€” whether it is passing laws that criminalize LGBT status, beating citizens simply for joining peaceful LGBT pride celebrations, or killing men, women, and children for their perceived sexual orientation,\\" Obama said. In its most recent human rights report, the State Department said under sharia law in the Saudi Arabia, \\"consensual same-sex conduct is punishable by death or flogging.\\" Ongoing case. It wasn't until this past February that Asseri was finally granted a hearing date for his appeal. At the court, the immigration officer offered him a deal to remain in the country permanently without possibility of asylum or a green card. Additionally, he could never leave the country. When he rejected the offer, the immigration officer applied for another continuance, saying she needed to submit more documents in the two-year case. He is now looking at a new hearing date in 2015. Today, Asseri barely makes ends meet as a part-time security guard. He lives on couches at friends' apartments in West Hollywood. His family has shunned him and his ex-wife won't allow him to talk to his son. As unbearable as his life in limbo is, he says returning to Saudi Arabia would be a death sentence. \\"There is no question,\\" he says. \\"If you go back and say I am gay and proud and I don't believe in religion anymore. Under sharia law this is death. You will be happy if they kill you right away. \\" Ahmed, the Saudi activist, says Asseri is a victim of U.S. desires not to upset the Saudi monarchy. Asseri had been convinced that Obama's stated commitment to gay rights would trump politics and keep him safe in the United States. \\"When President Obama ran in 2008 I supported him. I cried for him, I encouraged my American friends to vote for him. Now I can't stand to watch him on TV,\\" he says. \\"I'm angry. He said he supports the rights of gay people, so why is this happening to me?\\" The Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles did not return phone calls. The Department of Homeland Security declined comment, saying asylum cases were confidential.

Now, let's deduce the answer based on the available information. Given the context in the premise that talks about the game not being played at any time during the year, it does indirectly imply that there may be a specific time when the game should be played. However, the premise does not clearly limit that specific time to the month of March, as the hypothesis does.

To prepare for a work day at MGM Studios, she rises at 4:00 a.m. and engages in a strict morning ritual: scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling hot water, then plunging her face into a bowl of rubbing alcohol and ice to close the pores. When Helga (Alice Nunn), a new maid, thinks she has Joan's living room in spotless condition, Joan finds one minor detail that she overlooked and loses her temper.

When she is denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl whom she names Christina (Mara Hobel), and later a boy, Christopher (Jeremy Scott Reinholt). Joan sometimes lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a very stern code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with gifts, Joan allows her to choose only one she likes best that she can keep, then donates the rest to charity. As Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming-pool race and laughs at the child. Joan becomes enraged when Christina reacts with anger and locks her in the pool house. Later, Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her. Even though Christina openly denies it and despite her protests, Joan - thinking that Christina is making fun of her, always rummaging through her drawers, trying to find a way to make people look at her, and always looking at herself in the mirror - hysterically cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her. Joan resents Gregg's allegiance to studio boss Louis B....

Article: He's out there somewhere, an instant icon in the records of American conflict, the final big-game hunter. But a puzzle, too, his identity would be kept a secret for now, and maybe forever. He is the unknown shooter. The nameless, faceless triggerman who put a bullet in the head of the world's most notorious terrorist, Bin Laden. He's likely between the ages of 26 and 33, says Marcinko, founder of the \\"SEALs Team 6\\" that many believe led the attack on Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He'll be old enough to have had time to hurdle the extra training tests required to join the counter-terrorism unit, yet young enough to stand the body-punishing harshness of the job. The shooter's a man, it's safe to say, because there are no women in the SEALs. And there's a good chance he's white, though the SEALs have stepped up efforts to increase the number of minorities in their ranks, Marcinko and Smith say. He was probably a high school or college athlete, Smith says, a physical specimen who combines strength, speed and wisdom. \\"They call themselves 'tactical athletes,'\\" says Smith, who works with many future SEALs in his Heroes of Tomorrow training program in Severna Park. \\"It's getting very scientific.\\" Marcinko puts it in more conventional terms: \\"He'll be ripped,\\" says the author of the best-selling autobiography \\"Rogue Warrior.\\"\\"He's got a lot of upper-body strength. Long arms. Thin waist. Flat stomach.\\" On this point, Greitens departs a bit. \\"You can't make a lot of physical assumptions,\\" says the author of \\"The Heart and the Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL.\\" There are SEALs who are 5 feet 4 and SEALs who are 6 feet 5, Greitens says. In his training group, he adds, there were college football boys who couldn't hack it; those who survived were most often men in good shape, but they also had a willingness to show their concerns in favor of the mission. The shooter's probably not the crew-cut , neatly shaven ideal we've come to expect from American fighting forces. \\"He's bearded,...

Process:  - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more cake ingredients available happens, how will it affect MORE digestion occuring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The process of digestion begins in the mouth and continues through the stomach, intestines, and finally ends with excretion. To understand the effect of more cake ingredients being available on digestion, we need to delve deeper into the digestive process and examine any direct or indirect consequences. 1. Mouth: When you eat cake, the digestion starts in the mouth as you mentioned. Saliva, with the help of the enzyme amylase, begins breaking down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars. Chewing also breaks the cake into smaller pieces, increasing the surface area for enzymes to work on. 2. Esophagus: Once you swallow the cake, it travels through the esophagus, a muscular tube that moves food from the throat to the stomach. 3. Stomach: In the stomach, the cake is mixed with stomach acid and enzymes, like pepsin, which start breaking down proteins. The stomach's strong muscles mix and churn the food into a semi-liquid substance called chyme. 4. Small Intestine: Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. Here, it is mixed with bile from the liver (which emulsifies fats) and enzymes from the pancreas, such as lipase (for breaking down fats), trypsin, and chymotrypsin (for further protein digestion). Other enzymes from the intestinal walls, like maltase and lactase, help break down carbohydrates. Nutrients from the cake, including glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, are absorbed through the intestinal walls into the bloodstream. 5. Large Intestine: Finally, undigested food particles enter the large intestine, where water and electrolytes are absorbed, and the remaining waste is converted into feces for excretion. Now, considering the perturbation hypothesis: if more cake ingredients are available and this results in a larger serving size or more frequent consumption of cake, there may be both direct and indirect effects on digestion.  Direct effects: - Consuming larger portions or eating cake more frequently might lead to a higher intake of calories, sugar, and fat. This could require the digestive system to work harder and longer to process the food. - Overwhelming the digestive system with too much food at once might cause discomfort, such as bloating or indigestion. Indirect effects: - Consuming excessive amounts of cake could contribute to long-term health consequences, like obesity or diabetes, which can indirectly impact the efficiency of the digestive system and nutrient absorption. - A diet high in sugar and unhealthy fats might also lead to imbalances in gut bacteria, which play a crucial role in digestion and overall health. In conclusion, while the consumption of cake ingredients will not directly alter the digestion process, consuming more cake could place additional strain on the digestive system and indirectly affect one's health. It is important to maintain a balanced diet and moderate portion sizes to ensure optimal digestive function and overall wellbeing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:You are given a new situation: The Malegese Ocean is primarily connected to one river. This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke. Luke never disposes of any of his garbage in the ocean or rivers near his farm, and he chooses instead to store excess fertilizer for the future or properly dispose of his trash.  and a hint : Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles.

The fire which ripped through part of Eastbourne Pier is now being treated as suspicious, police have said. New information today suggests the blaze on the 144-year-old structure on Wednesday ‘may have been started by someone, either deliberately or accidentally’. It comes after David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne visited the town to announce a £2million cash injection to help with the aftermath of the blaze. Scroll down for video. David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne visited Eastbourne pier today after pledging to support town. The Prime Minister walks alongside the devastated wreckage along with George Osborne and members of the East Sussex Fire and Rescue who managed to save most of the structure. Outside the former entrance to the pier, David Cameron speaks with members of the fire service. Detective Inspector Mark O'Brien, of Sussex Police, said: ‘As a result of our investigation we have received information to suggest that the fire may have been started by someone, either deliberately or accidentally, and our investigation is now focusing on that line of enquiry. ‘A temporary scaffold platform has been erected adjacent to where the fire is thought to have broken out in order to enable scenes of crime officers and fire investigators safe access to the area.’ Police have called on people to submit pictures or video footage taken at the entrance or on the pier in the hours before it started. Superintendent Laurence Taylor said: ‘The area around and under the pier is still very hazardous and there is a security team deployed to stop people putting themselves in danger.’ The Prime Minister met with the crew from the Inshore Lifeboat Station as the wreckage stood behind him. David Cameron shaking hands with members of the fire and rescue service who saved most of the building. The Prime Minister visited the town today with George Osborne as he pledged to support the town. The pair met with members of the East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service and the crew from the Inshore Lifeboat Station. Mr Cameron said: ‘The Government is absolutely committed to supporting coastal towns, and through our long-term economic plan we are creating jobs and boosting tourism. ‘I know that the loss of one of Eastbourne’s most prominent and well-loved landmarks will have hit the town hard and I am determined to do all I can to help local businesses recover.’ The fire happened at the height of Eastbourne’s important summer tourist season. In the next fortnight, the resort hosts its biggest summer tourist event - the annual Airbourne Air Show - which draws tens of thousands of visitors. Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne also announced an extra £3 million for the Government’s Coastal Communities Fund to encourage growth and create jobs in coastal towns. Mr Osborne said: ‘Eastbourne Pier is a much-loved local attraction and this fire is devastating news. I am therefore delighted to be able to provide financial support so we can minimise the effect on business and tourism. People walk along the beach to catch a glimpse of what remains of devastated Eastbourne Pier. The town is now set to receive a £2 million boost after a fire destroyed its Grade II listed pier this week. ‘We will work with Eastbourne as a matter of urgency to ensure that the funding is provided without delay so people can start enjoying the pier again.’ Coastal Communities Minister Penny Mordaunt named 10 coastal towns which will receive £8.5 million from the fund in the latest round of applications. The money will be used to boost tourism, regenerate historic sites and provide new flood defences, Downing Street said. But there is hopes that the fire-hit pier could reopen again as early as next year, as two-thirds of it was untouched by flames, according to Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd. The Liberal Democrat MP has said that following talks with East Sussex’s chief fire officer, the structure appeared ‘pretty sound’ and called on the community to rally round the pier’s stricken traders after fears that some had no insurance. Mr Lloyd said: ‘There is real damage but I’m confident that it can be repaired. Crowds gathered on Wednesday as the popular pier went up in flames and plumes of smoke billowed out. It took more than 80 firefighters to dampen down the tangled wreck of Eastbourne Pier after the blaze. Crews were still dousing flames the morning after a large section was destroyed and left a charred shell. ‘It’s still very much standing, and I’m very hopeful and confident that it will be reopening next year and be back in business.’ Helen Brook and Stuart Pearce, who were due to get married on the pier in three weeks’ time, have seen their dream dashed. The couple were to have wed on a section of the Victorian structure which escaped the flames. Ms Brook told ITV Meridian: ‘Once we heard that people were safe and had been evacuated, it then hit home what it meant for us. ‘Since yesterday, it has been a very emotional couple of days. We are just shell-shocked really.’ Holiday makers walk along the promenade with the pier stretching out to sea in the background. Passengers landing on Eastbourne Pier after a boat cruise in 1936.

East Sussex has been cursed by the devastation of some of its beloved piers in recent times. In 2003 the 148-year-old West Pier in Brighton was reduced to a mangled mass of metal by two major blazes within two months. In Hastings, the Grade II listed pier was almost destroyed in a fire in 2010 following years of neglect by its then-Panama-registered owner.

I had high expectations considering the buzz around it, but it has been an absolute disaster. In my opinion, this app deserves only 1-star for the following reasons: 1. Terrible performance - The app consistently performs poorly. It lags, freezes, and crashes multiple times a day, making it virtually impossible to use. I've tried clearing cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, and even using it on a different device, but the same issues persist. 2. Unresponsive customer support - I reached out to the customer support team several times, hoping they could offer some guidance or solutions. The responses were either robotic or lacking in any helpful information, leaving me to fend for myself. 3. Cluttered and confusing interface - The user interface is so cluttered and confusing that it takes a considerable amount of time to find what I'm looking for. The app does not follow any intuitive design principles, making navigation a headache. 4. Subpar features - Many advertised features either underperform or are completely non-existent. The customization options are limited and the implemented ones do not function well, leaving my phone's home screen looking like a mess. 5. Drains battery life - The app somehow consumes an unreasonable amount of battery life, even when it's not actively in use. This has forced me to constantly recharge my phone throughout the day. In conclusion, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend com.kaneoriley.cyanogenport.launcher3 to anyone.

What area in the area that is used for hiking, hunting, and fishing was reopened for fishing in 1959?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  According to the DCNR, Quehanna Wild Area is for the public \\"to see, use and enjoy for such activities as hiking, hunting, and fishing\\". The main hiking trail on the Quehanna plateau is the Quehanna Trail, a 75-mile (121 km) loop trail that passes through the wild area and Moshannon and Elk State Forests. The main trailhead for most hikers is at Parker Dam State Park to the west of the wild area. From there the trail, which is blazed in orange, heads east to the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, skirts Piper and the Boot Camp there, then turns north, crosses Wykoff Run and turns west again. After passing through Marion Brooks Natural Area, the trail leaves the wild area and completes the loop back at Parker Dam. The Quehanna Trail is considered a strenuous hike not just because of its length, but for its 9,700 feet (2,957 m) of changes in elevation. Two blue-blazed connector trails add 30 miles (48 km) to the system, and there are many side trails and small trails off the Quehanna Highway. Most trails are open to cross-country skiing in the winter. According to the DCNR, the Quehanna Trail \\"passes through some of the most wild and beautiful country Pennsylvania has to offer\\".Susan Stranahan's Susquehanna: River of Dreams reports that before Curtiss-Wright took over the area in 1955, Quehanna was considered \\"some of the best hunting land in the state\\". No hunting or fishing were initially allowed on the leased land, but by July 1959 fishing on Mosquito Creek was allowed again, as was limited hunting to help control the deer. In October 1963 hunting resumed throughout the wild area, four years before the state purchased the land back from Curtiss-Wright. As of 2010, the Pennsylvania Game Commission allowed hunting of the following species found in Quehanna Wild Area: American crow, beaver, black bear, black squirrel, bobcat, bobwhite quail, cottontail rabbit, coyote, elk, house sparrow, raccoon, red fox, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and woodcock.

Police were still trying to sort out what led Heriberto Pagan to drive from his home in Brooklyn to his daughter's Staten Island house Friday and shoot two people before taking his own life. A law enforcement source said investigators were looking into the possibility that the grandson \\"was trying to take over\\" the home with his girlfriend and Pagan \\"wasn't appreciative of the way\\" his daughter was being treated in the process. It was not clear whether the daughter was at home at the time. Police found Pagan, a gunshot wound to the head, outside his car Friday evening near the home where the shootings occurred. He was hospitalized in critical condition, but died Saturday morning, police said. In the vicinity, police were alerted to another shooting victim, Pagan's 47-year-old grandson, who was critically injured with a gunshot wound to the head and found outside the Staten Island house where he lived with his mother and girlfriend. The grandson has not been identified. Inside the house, police found a second victim, Claritle Christina Huerta, 28, also shot in the head. She was pronounced dead at a local hospital. \\"This is like a nightmare,\\" neighbor John Rina told CNN affiliate WCBS. Police said Pagan shot his grandson as the younger man approached the house. He then shot Huerta inside before driving a few blocks and shooting himself, authorities said. \\"I just heard a man screaming 'help me, help me,'\\" a neighbor, not identified, told WCBS.

On January 5, 1900, four friends arrive for a dinner at the London home of their inventor friend George, but he is not there. He arrives suddenly, bedraggled and exhausted, and begins describing the strange experiences he has had since they last met. At their earlier dinner on New Year's Eve, George said that time was \\"the fourth dimension\\". He shows David Filby, Dr. Philip Hillyer, Anthony Bridewell, and Walter Kemp a small model time machine and asks one of them to press a tiny lever on the model. The device disappears, validating his claim, but his friends remain unconvinced; their reactions vary from curiosity to frank dismissal. George bids his guests a good evening, then heads downstairs where his full-size time machine awaits. He presses a lever and moves forward through time 17 years into the future to September 15, 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who tells him of Filby's death in a war. Saddened, he resumes his journey, stopping on June 19, 1940 during The Blitz, finding himself in the midst of \\"a new war\\"; George resumes his journey and his house is hit by a bomb and is destroyed. George stops on August 19, 1966 finding his neighborhood now part of a futuristic metropolis. People hurry into a nearby fallout shelter amid the blare of air raid sirens. An elderly James Filby urges George to immediately take cover. Moments later, a nuclear explosion destroys London, causing a volcanic eruption around him.

Looks Like America In a Cabinet designed to look like America, Zoe Baird, the Attorney General-designate, has the bearing and credentials of what America would like to look like. Personable and smart, experienced in the ways of the Justice Department and White House, Ms. Baird more than vindicates President-elect Clinton's determination to put a woman at the head of the Federal legal establishment. After weeks of churning, Mr. Clinton has succeeded in assembling a Cabinet of rare, welcome diversity. Just how rare can be judged by comparing it with President Bush's performance. Of 16 positions in the Cabinet, 11 are now held by white men, 3 by women, 1 by a black man and 1 by a Hispanic man. Of 16 nominees to Mr. Clinton's cabinet, 7 are white men, 4 are women, 4 are black (1 is a black woman) and 2 are Hispanic. Diversity, while it demonstrates respect for minority Americans, does not by itself assure distinction. Starting with Ms. Baird, the appointees Mr. Clinton announced yesterday give promise of capable public service. For instance, environmentalists were disappointed that Tim Wirth, a longtime champion of environmental causes, was passed over for Interior and Energy. But they can only be pleased with the appointment of Bruce Babbitt, the former Governor of Arizona and witty candidate for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination, as Secretary of the Interior. Federico Pena, designated as Transportation Secretary, brings experience as the Mayor of Denver who fought for construction of a massive new airport. Mickey Kantor, Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, has had no special experience to qualify him as U.S. trade representative. But like Carla Hills, Mr. Bush's choice who has performed brilliantly, he is a shrewd lawyer and negotiator who knows politics and public service. The most impressive nomination yesterday was Ms. Baird's. In a field long dominated by men, she has more than held her own. She was comfortable in male-dominated law environments when she rendered scholarly advice to the White House and practicing at high levels of corporate law. Ms. Baird has the added advantage of being neither the President's crony nor sycophant. Compare that with the Attorneys General -- all of them -- of the Reagan-Bush years. William French Smith looked and acted like a society lawyer. Edwin Meese looked and acted like a harsh partisan. Richard Thornburgh looked promising but acted like a candidate for high office. And William Barr, the incumbent short-timer, has pandered eagerly to the White House. A decade ago, Mr. Smith defaulted on his duty to defend the Internal Revenue Service's right to deny tax exemptions to racially discriminatory schools. Ms. Baird was part of the team of private lawyers that stepped in and successfully did that job as friend of the court. She will inherit a department with strong traditions but whose professionals have been short-changed in recent years for want of principled leadership. Mr. Clinton has made a wise choice for Justice, as he has made a wide choice for diversity. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Zoe Baird, the Attorney General-designate, has an impressive background and credentials, which validates President-elect Clinton's decision to appoint a woman to lead the Federal legal establishment. 2.

Loans for Multifamily Homes THE rental market’s strength may be enticing some buyers to look at multifamily properties, but qualifying for a mortgage on rental units is often more difficult than on a single-family residence. Borrowers should be prepared to gather more documentation, and the interest rate and required down payment will very likely be higher. “It looks a lot easier than it is,” said Neil B. Garfinkel, a partner in charge of the real estate practice at Abrams Garfinkel Margolis Bergson, suggesting that anyone new to this subject work with a real estate professional experienced in rental properties. But the extra effort may be worthwhile for some people looking for income, or at least help with covering monthly expenses. A recent report by Frank E. Nothaft, the chief economist for Freddie Mac, noted that “the rental market has been a bright spot in the housing sector this year,” as more households postpone home-buying because of the uncertain economy. The overall rental vacancy rate in Manhattan is hovering around 1 percent, while rents are up for all kinds of apartments. Mr. Garfinkel, who is also an owner of apartments in Brooklyn and the Bronx through an investment firm, says buyers of multifamily property will need to do their due diligence on all the active leases and any service contracts for the building, including the employment terms of the superintendent. Some lenders are more comfortable lending for property with tenants in place, said John Manning, a Brooklyn mortgage broker, while vacant buildings would be fine with others. Mr. Manning’s advice: “Expect to put down 25 to 35 percent, or even more, as a down payment,” well above the 20 percent typically expected these days on single-family loans. He also notes that because multifamily properties are considered riskier, government agencies like Freddie Mac impose a “risk-based pricing adjustment,” which adds a quarter to a half percentage point to the mortgage rate (or buyers can pay a fee equal to 1 percent of the loan amount). The size of the multifamily building determines how lenders evaluate it. A two- to four-unit residence can usually be financed under Fannie Mae’s conventional mortgage guidelines, but if the owner does not plan to live there, he or she can expect to pay a higher mortgage rate. Borrowers’ incomes, credit scores and financial standing will be key. Mortgages for buildings with five or more apartments generally fall in the nonconforming-loans category, and may even be considered a commercial mortgage. The lender will be evaluating these rental properties as if they constituted a small business, Mr. Manning said, which means it will want to make sure that the rents cover the mortgage and other expenses. In many cases, these loans will come from a bank’s commercial lending department. Sometimes local or regional banks will offer them, but only if the property is in their area, according to Mark Lazar, an owner of Allied Financial, a mortgage brokerage in River Edge, N.J. Mr. Lazar says that those considering renting out their primary or second homes shouldn’t assume that the rental income will help them qualify for a mortgage. Many lenders require a homeowner to have at least 30 percent of the home’s value in equity before counting any rental income. For a first-time landlord, he added, only about half of lenders will count the rental income toward the total income needed to finance the multifamily purchase. “If you do not demonstrate experience as a landlord,” Mr. Lazar said, “we will not allow the credit to income,” even if the rent checks have come in steadily for the previous owner. Multifamily buyers should also consider the tax implications, including some favorable deductions for maintenance, snow removal and depreciation. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. Qualifying for a mortgage on rental units can be more difficult than on a single-family residence, with higher interest rates and down payments. 2. Buyers should work with a real estate professional experienced in rental properties and do their due diligence on active leases and service contracts of the building. 3. Down payments on multifamily properties typically range from 25 to 35 percent, higher than the 20 percent expected for single-family loans. 4. Government agencies like Freddie Mac impose a \\"risk-based pricing adjustment\\" on multifamily mortgage rates due to the increased risk. 5. The size of the multifamily building determines how lenders evaluate it, with two- to four-unit residences financed under Fannie Mae's conventional guidelines, while larger buildings may require commercial mortgage considerations. 6. Lenders may require homeowners to have at least 30 percent of the home's value in equity before counting rental income, and first-time landlords may only have half of their rental income considered in the qualifying process. 7.

Step by step, this would be: 1. Translate \\"The Jaws does not come with a mouthpiece\\" into Spanish. 2. Translate \\"but it accommodates any 510 mouthpiece.\\" into Spanish. So the translation of the first part, \\"The Jaws does not come with a mouthpiece\\" is \\"The Jaws no viene con una boquilla\\". I have just translated each word to the most appropriate Spanish equivalent, while also maintaining the overall structure of the sentence. Secondly, translating \\"but it accommodates any 510 mouthpiece.\\" into Spanish would be \\"pero puede acomodar cualquier boquilla 510.\\". In this case, I utilized the Spanish word for \\"but\\" (pero), followed by a translation of \\"it accommodates\\" (puede acomodar), based on the context that \\"it\\" refers to Jaws. After that, the phrase \\"any 510 mouthpiece\\" is translated to \\"cualquier boquilla 510.\\" Joining both parts of the translated sentence, we have: \\"The Jaws no viene con una boquilla, pero puede acomodar cualquier boquilla 510.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers.

La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for two months. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the Belle finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from New France, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the Illinois Country. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day Navasota on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time.

Context: Papa, as a son of a dirt-poor farmer, left school early and went to work in a factory, for education was for the rich then. So, the world became his school. With great interest, he read everything he could lay his hands on, listened to the town elders and learned about the world beyond his tiny hometown. \\"There's so much to learn,\\" he'd say. \\"Though we're born stupid, only the stupid remain that way. \\" He was determined that none of his children would be denied an education. Thus, Papa insisted that we learn at least one new thing each day. Though, as children, we thought this was crazy, it would never have occurred to us to deny Papa a request. And dinner time seemed perfect for sharing what we had learned. We would talk about the news of the day; no matter how insignificant, it was never taken lightly. Papa would listen carefully and was ready with some comment, always to the point. Then came the moment--the time to share the day's new learning. Papa, at the head of the table, would push back his chair and pour a glass of red wine, ready to listen. \\"Felice,\\" he'd say, \\"tell me what you learned today. \\" \\"I learned that the population of Nepal is .... \\" Silence. Papa was thinking about what was said, as if the salvation of the world would depend upon it. \\"The population of Nepal. Hmm. Well . . . . \\" he'd say. \\"Get the map; let's see where Nepal is. \\" And the whole family went on a search for Nepal. This same experience was repeated until each family member had a turn. Dinner ended only after we had a clear understanding of at least half a dozen such facts. As children, we thought very little about these educational wonders. Our family, however, was growing together, sharing experiences and participating in one another's education. And by looking at us, listening to us, respecting our input, affirming our value, giving us a sense of dignity, Papa was unquestionably our most influential teacher. Later during my training as a future teacher /1 studied with some of the most famous educators. They were imparting what Papa had known all along--the value of continual learning.

Threatened with frostbite and pneumonia, he is coerced into divulging intelligence to his German interrogator.He and many other Americans are later transferred by train to a prisoner of war camp. While en route, a flight of P-51 Mustangs attack the station. Since the painted letters POW on the top of the train are covered by thick snow, the Mustangs fire on the train, causing some of the POWs to be killed by friendly fire. To save themselves, the POWs leave the train, spell POW with their bodies, and prevent further strafing.After arriving at the camp, Hart is debriefed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it. McNamara knows this to be a lie, since he knows Hart was held for three days after seeing only a Level 1 interrogator. He does not reveal this to Hart and sends him to bunk in a barracks for enlisted men, rather than allow him to bunk with the other officers.Two Tuskegee Airmen are brought to the camp, Second Lieutenants, Lincoln A. Scott (Howard) and Lamar T. Archer (Vicellous Reon Shannon). They are the only blacks in the platoon, and their situation is compounded by their status as officers. Staff Sergeant Vic W. Bedford (Cole Hauser), a vicious racist, is their primary antagonist.Later, a spike from the fence, which could be used as a weapon, is found in Archer's bunk. The Germans drag him out, and, as he stands proud and defiant, shoot him, claiming that he was trying to escape.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: James Hudson Taylor (Chinese: Dai De Sheng ; 21 May 1832 - 3 June 1905) was a British Protestant Christian missionary to China and founder of the China Inland Mission (CIM, now OMF International). Taylor spent 51 years in China. The society that he began was responsible for bringing over 800 missionaries to the country who began 125 schools and directly resulted in 18,000 Christian conversions, as well as the establishment of more than 300 stations of work with more than 500 local helpers in all eighteen provinces. Taylor was born on 21 May 1832 the son of a chemist (pharmacist) and Methodist lay preacher James Taylor and his wife, Amelia (Hudson), but as a young man he ran away from the Christian beliefs of his parents. At 17, after reading an evangelistic tract pamphlet entitled \\"Poor Richard\\", he professed faith in Christ, and in December 1849, he committed himself to going to China as a missionary. At this time he came into contact with Edward Cronin of Kensington--one of the members of the first missionary party of the Plymouth Brethren to Baghdad. It is believed that Taylor learned his faith mission principles from his contact with the Brethren. Taylor was able to borrow a copy of China: Its State and Prospects by Walter Henry Medhurst, which he quickly read. About this time, he began studying the languages of Mandarin, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.  In 1851, he moved to a poor neighborhood in Kingston upon Hull to be a medical assistant with Robert Hardey, and began preparing himself for a life of faith and service, devoting himself to the poor and exercising faith that God would provide for his needs. He practised distributing gospel tracts and open-air preaching among the poor. He was baptized by Andrew John Jukes of the Plymouth Brethren in the Hull Brethren Assembly in 1852, and convinced his sister Amelia to also take adult baptism.  In 1852 he began studying medicine at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, London, as preparation for working in China. The great interest awakened in England about China through the civil war, which was then erroneously supposed to be a mass movement toward Christianity, together with the glowing but exaggerated reports made by Karl Gutzlaff concerning China's accessibility, led to the founding of the Chinese Evangelisation Society, to the service of which Hudson Taylor offered himself as their first missionary. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"There are several interesting aspects in the article on James Hudson Taylor. One notable aspect is his early life and turning point in his personal beliefs. Initially, he strayed away from the Christian beliefs of his parents, but at the age of 17, he read an evangelistic tract pamphlet, \\"Poor Richard,\\" which eventually led to his conversion to Christianity. This proved to be a pivotal moment in his life as he then decided to dedicate himself to missionary work in China. Another interesting component of the article is Taylor's extensive language learning efforts. He diligently studied Mandarin, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin, which implied his dedication to not only understanding the languages but also effectively communicating with people in different regions, particularly China. Furthermore, Taylor's decision to immerse himself in a poor neighborhood and work as a medical assistant demonstrated his commitment to serving the needy and preparing for his life as a missionary. He practiced distributing gospel tracts and preaching in public spaces, focusing on reaching out to the impoverished population. Taylor's connection to the Plymouth Brethren, particularly Edward Cronin and Andrew John Jukes, also played a significant role in shaping his faith mission principles. It is believed that his experiences with the Brethren helped develop his understanding of faith and service. Lastly, there is the mention of larger socio-political events in England. The civil war in China and its misinterpretation as a mass movement towards Christianity, as well as Karl Gutzlaff's exaggerated reports on China's accessibility, fueled interest in the region. This ultimately led to the establishment of the Chinese Evangelisation Society, to which Hudson Taylor offered his service as their first missionary. This decision marked the beginning of his long and influential missionary work in China."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Fact 1: Sugar causes food to taste sweet.

Article: A city in South Korea has added a new attraction to its cultural landscape --the world's first \\"Toilet Theme Park\\". The Restroom Cultural Park in the city of Suwon is proving a huge hit with locals and tourists alike. The park was built to memorize the former city mayor Sim Jae-duck, known as \\"Mr. Toilet\\". He believed the toilet is a very important place and full of culture. Visitors to the park can enjoy its toilet- bowl- shaped exhibition hall as well as lots of bronze statues  in all kinds of toilet positions. They can even sit on Mr. Kim's original toilet, which includes a full-length glass door that mists  up when it is being used. Suwon has become well known because of the promotion  of toilet culture. The city attracts toilet- related artwork from around the world to its galleries. It famously hosts the Golden Poop Art Festival- a celebration of one of the calls of nature. The city also lists lots of its own public toilets as tourist attractions on its website. Sim Jae-duck's toilet-shaped house, now a museum, should be the must-see for _ .

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Information:  - Wallace Markfield (August 12, 1926  May 24, 2002) was an American comic novelist best known for his first novel, \\"To an Early Grave\\" (1964), about four men who spend the day driving across Brooklyn to their friend's funeral. He is also known for \\"Teitlebaum's Window\\" (1970), a comic novel about a Jewish boy growing up in Brooklyn in the 1930s and 1940s. Markfield was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965 after the publication of \\"To an Early Grave\\".  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Herbert Sargent ( July 15 , 1923 -- May 6 , 2005 ) was an American television writer , a producer for such comedy shows as The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live , and a screenwriter ( Bye Bye Braverman ) . During his tenure at Saturday Night Live , he and Chevy Chase created Weekend Update , the longest - running sketch in the show 's history , and one of the longest running sketches on television .  - A television set, more commonly called a television, TV, TV set, television receiver, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and loudspeakers for the purpose of viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. In the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays, especially LED-backlit LCDs, largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays.  - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI.  - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912  January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century.  - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy.  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation.  - Live television is a television production broadcast in real-time, as events happen, in the present. Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, and, occasionally, episodes of television series. Live television was more common until the late 1950s, when videotape technology was invented. Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some television show remained live until the 1970s, such as soap operas. To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be delayed, which allows censors to edit the program. Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others.  - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - A variety show, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts (hence the name), especially musical performances and sketch comedy, and is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days (late 1940s) into the 1980s.  - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014).  - The Colbert Report is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News' \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\". \\"The Colbert Report\\" is a spin-off of Comedy Central's \\"The Daily Show\\", where he acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character.  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show currently broadcast from the Rockefeller Center in New York City (and previously from various studios in the Los Angeles region) and airing on NBC since 1954. It is the world's longest-running talk show, and the longest running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows \\"Today\\" and \\"Meet the Press\\".  - A late-night talk show is a genre of talk show popular in the US, structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. The late-night talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by Johnny Carson with \\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\\" on NBC. Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch. Many late night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist.  - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.  - A cold open (also called a teaser) in a television program or movie is the technique of jumping directly into a story at the beginning or opening of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown. On television, this is often done on the theory that involving the audience in the plot as soon as possible will reduce the likelihood of their switching away from a show during the opening commercial. A cold open may summarize events in previous episodes or storylines that will be revisited during the current episode.  - The Daily Show is an American news satire and late-night talk show television program hosted by Trevor Noah. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Describing itself as a fake news program, \\"The Daily Show\\" draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor as well.   - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\".  - In theatre (especially in the illusionistic Western tradition), breaking character occurs when an actor ceases to maintain the illusion that they are identical with the character they are portraying. If the breaking of character is particularly serious, it is considered corpsing, which in film or television would normally result in an abandonment of that take.  - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay.  - In theatre, a monologue (from , from  \\"mónos\\", \\"alone, solitary\\" and  \\"lógos\\", \\"speech\\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.  - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics. He had previously been the chairman of NBC Sports, producing large scale television events such as the Olympic Games and National Football League broadcasts.  - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.  - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. The network is part of the Big Three television networks. NBC is sometimes referred to as the \\"Peacock Network\\", in reference to its stylized peacock logo, which was originally created in 1956 for its then-new color broadcasts and became the network's official emblem in 1979.  - Weekend Update is a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch that comments on and parodies . It is the show's longest-running recurring sketch, having been on since the show's first broadcast, and is typically presented in the middle of the show immediately after the first musical performance. One or two of the players are cast in the role of news anchor, presenting gag news items based on and acting as hosts for occasional editorials, commentaries, or other performances by other cast members or guests. Chevy Chase has credited Weekend Update, which he started as anchor in 1975, for paving the way for comedic news shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" and \\"The Colbert Report\\".  - Cornelius Crane \\"Chevy\\" Chase (born October 8, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer and producer. Born into a prominent New York family, he worked a plethora of strange jobs before moving into comedy and began acting with \\"National Lampoon\\". He immediately became a key cast member in the debut season of \\"Saturday Night Live\\", where his recurring \\"Weekend Update\\" segment soon became a staple of the show.  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.  - Meet the Press is a weekly American television news/interview program that is broadcast on NBC. It is the longest-running program in U.S. television history, though its current format bears little resemblance to the one it debuted with on November 6, 1947. Like similar shows that have followed it, \\"Meet the Press\\" specializes in interviews with national leaders on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy and other public affairs, along with panel discussions that provide opinions and analysis. It originates from NBC's Washington, D.C. studios.  - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white. However, scientifically speaking, monochromatic light refers to visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (see spectral color).  - Sidney Arthur Lumet (; June 25, 1924  April 9, 2011) was an American director, producer and screenwriter with over 50 films to his credit. He was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Director for \\"12 Angry Men\\" (1957), \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" (1975), \\"Network\\" (1976) and \\"The Verdict\\" (1982). He did not win an individual Academy Award, but he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as \\"Network\\", which was nominated for ten, winning four.  - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.  - Rockefeller Center is a large complex consisting of 19 highrise commercial buildings covering between 48th and 51st Streets in New York City. Commissioned by the Rockefeller family, it is located in the center of Midtown Manhattan, spanning the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.  - Bye Bye Braverman is a 1968 American comedy film directed by Sidney Lumet. The screenplay by Herbert Sargent was adapted from the 1964 novel \\"To an Early Grave\\" by Wallace Markfield.   - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic.  - Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show.  - Screenwriting, also called scriptwriting, is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films, television productions or video games. It is frequently a freelance profession.  - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes.

Suddenly, I heard the children running down the stairs and shouting, \\"Freddie, Freddie.\\" _ My three-year old son Freddie was lying on his side on the ground. I cried for my husband Simon to dial 999 and within minutes the air ambulance arrived. They quickly took him in the helicopter. During the flight, Freddie was looking at me and I remember thinking was a good sign, but then his eyes began to roll. As the doctors tried to stabilize  him, I couldn't believe what was happening. When we arrived at the hospital in Portsmouth, there were some doctors and nurses waiting for us and they immediately set to work on Freddie. I was hopelessly wishing everything would be alright, but Freddie had broken his skull in two places and blood clots were forming in his brain. He needed surgery , and only a surgeon at another hospital in Bristol could do it. This meant another helicopter ride, but we couldn't go with Freddie because there was no enough space. Simon and I drove the long 130 miles from our home in north Devon in silence. Neither of us dared say what we were thinking, \\"What if we get there and he's dead?\\" \\"Is he going to be brain-damaged?\\" Freddie was just coming out of surgery when we arrived. The surgeon said it had gone well. When I finally saw him, I hardly recognize my child--he was covered in tubes and there were wires coming out of his head. On the third day, Simon went home to see our three girls and to pick up some clean clothes for us. While he was gone, the pressure in Freddie's brain suddenly increased. He was taken into theater again and this time I fell apart. Luckily, the surgery managed to stabilize Freddie. After almost a week, Freddie was finally woken up. When he opened his eyes, he looked at me. He didn't say anything, but I knew straight away that it was my old Freddie, and that he was going to be alright. Over the next two weeks, his recovery went well. After help with learning to swallow... Options: A the author's son finally opened his eyes.

Context: Trying to snap a two-game skid, the Bears flew to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome for a Week 15 Monday night NFC North rematch with the Minnesota Vikings. In the first quarter, Chicago struck first as kicker Robbie Gould got a 29-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Vikings tied the game with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 42-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Bears would take the halftime lead as Gould kicked a 47-yard field goal and FB Jason McKie managed to get a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Minnesota started to creep closer as RB Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run (with a failed PAT) for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Vikings took the lead with Peterson getting an 8-yard TD run. Chicago tried to rally, but Minnesota's defense was too much. With their third-straight loss, not only did the Bears fall to 5-9, but they were knocked out of playoff contention. On a positive note, LB Brian Urlacher had a good day with 4 tackles, 2 sacks, and an interception. It was also the first time since 2004 that Urlacher had a sack and an interception in the same game.

Information:  - Baden-Württemberg is a state in Germany located in the southwest, east of the Upper Rhine. It is Germanys third largest state in terms of size and population, with an area of and 10.8 million inhabitants. The state capital and largest city is Stuttgart.  - Common Era or Current Era, abbreviated CE, is a calendar era that is used as an alternative naming of the \\"Anno Domini\\" era (\\"in the year of the Lord\\"), abbreviated AD.  The system uses BCE as an abbreviation for \\"before the Common (or Current) Era\\" and CE as an abbreviation for \\"Common Era\\". The CE/BCE designation uses the same numeric values as the \\"Anno Domini\\" year-numbering system first used by the 6th-century Christian monk Dionysius Exiguus. Neither notation includes a year zero, and the two notations (CE/BCE and AD/BC) are numerically equivalent; thus \\" CE\\" corresponds to \\"AD \\", and \\"400 BCE\\" corresponds to \\"400 BC\\". The Gregorian calendar and the year-numbering system associated with it is the calendar system with most widespread use in the world today. For decades, it has been the global standard, recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations and the Universal Postal Union.  - The Julian calendar, proposed by Julius Caesar in 46 BC (708 AUC), was a reform of the Roman calendar. It took effect on 1 January 45 BC (AUC 709) (shortly before the Roman conquest of Egypt), by edict. It was the predominant calendar in the Roman world, most of Europe, and in European settlements in the Americas and elsewhere, until it was refined and gradually replaced by the Gregorian calendar, promulgated in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. The Julian calendar gains against the mean tropical year at the rate of one day in 128 years. For the Gregorian the figure is one day in 3,030 years. The difference in the average length of the year between Julian (365.25 days) and Gregorian (365.2425 days) is 0.002%.  - Otto of Sankt Blasien was a German Benedictine chronicler . He was born about the middle of the 12th century ; died on 23 July 1223 , at Sankt Blasien in the Black Forest , Baden ( southwestern Germany ) . Nothing is known of the events of his life . It is probable that in his later days he became abbot of the renowned Benedictine monastery of Sankt Blasien . He is known as the writer who continued the chronicles of Otto of Freising , like whom he possessed a great talent for presenting a clear survey of events . His language was lofty , and followed the model of the ancient classics . Like many of his contemporaries , he liked to apply the fixed formulas of Justinian to the German emperors , probably on the assumption , then widespread , that the Holy Roman Empire was only the continuation of the Roman Empire of the Caesars . His chronicles , written in the form of annals , \`\` Ad librum VII chronici Ottonis Frisingensis episcopi continuatae historiae appendix sive Continuatio Sanblasiana '' , embrace the period from 1146 to 1209 , that is the period from Conrad III to the murder of Philip of Swabia . Since he was distant in time from the facts he narrates , his accounts are quite objective , even though he makes no concealment of his prejudice in favour of the Hohenstaufen dynasty , which in 1218 received the bailiwick of St. Blasien from the dukes of Zahringen . Yet , after Otto of Brunswick was recognized as Holy Roman emperor , he writes of him in the same objective way as of his predecessors . Nevertheless , without any apparent cause , the narrative breaks off at the coronation of Otto IV. Perhaps the chronicler shrank from describing the bloody party conflicts of the times . His chief sources were the \`\` Gesta Friderici '' and perhaps Alsatian chronicles . On the whole his statements may be trusted . It is only when he has to resort to oral reports that he becomes unreliable ; this is especially the case in his chronology , though he is not to be reproached with intentional misrepresentation of facts...  - As a means of recording the passage of time, the 12th century is the period from 1101 to 1200 in accordance with the Julian calendar in the Common Era. In the history of European culture, this period is considered part of the High Middle Ages and is sometimes called the Age of the Cistercians. In Song dynasty China an invasion by Jurchens caused a political schism of north and south. The Khmer Empire of Cambodia flourished during this century, while the Fatimids of Egypt were overtaken by the Ayyubid dynasty.  - The Ayyubid dynasty ('; ') was a Muslim dynasty of Kurdish origin, founded by Saladin and centered in Egypt. The dynasty ruled much of the Middle East during the 12th and 13th centuries CE. Saladin had been the vizier of Fatimid Egypt before toppling the Fatimids in 1171. Three years later, he proclaimed himself sultan following the death of his former master, the Zengid ruler Nur al-Din. For the next decade, the Ayyubids launched conquests throughout the region and by 1183, they controlled Egypt, Syria, northern Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen, and the North African coast up to the borders of modern-day Tunisia. Most of the Kingdom of Jerusalem fell to Saladin after his victory at the Battle of Hattin in 1187. However, the Crusaders regained control of Palestine's coastline in the 1190s.  - The High Middle Ages or High Medieval Period was the period of European history around the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c. 10011300). The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around 1500.  - Year 1200 (MCC) was a leap year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the  Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.  The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about .  - Year 1101 (MCI) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. It was the 2nd year of the 1100s decade, and the 1st year of the 12th century.  - The Black Forest is a large forested mountain range in the state of Baden-Württemberg in southwestern Germany. It is bounded by the Rhine valley to the west and south. Its highest peak is the Feldberg with an elevation of 1,493 metres (4,898 ft). The region is roughly oblong in shape with a length of and breadth of up to .  - The Song dynasty (9601279) was an era of Chinese history that began in 960 and continued until 1279. It succeeded the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, coincided with the Liao and Western Xia dynasties, and was followed by the Yuan dynasty. It was the first government in world history to issue banknotes or true paper money nationally and the first Chinese government to establish a permanent standing navy. This dynasty also saw the first known use of gunpowder, as well as the first discernment of true north using a compass.  - St. Blasien (Sankt Blasien) is a small town located in the Waldshut district in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

What is the best way to: Use toilet paper rolls for in home bowling.","output":"To create a home bowling game using toilet paper rolls, follow these steps: Step 1: Gather Materials:  Firstly, we need toilet paper rolls, a ball (like a tennis ball), and a flat playing surface. Wifi would be required for the AI to access the internet to provide step-by-step guidance. No internet connection is required if the whole process is already known to the user. Step 2: Number of pins: We will set the number of pins, i.e., toilet paper rolls we'll use. Bowling in professional settings uses 10 pins, but this can be adjusted depending on the space available at home.  Step 3: Set up the \\"pins\\": Set the empty toilet paper rolls on a flat surface. Formation should be in a triangular shape: 1 in the first row, then 2 in the second, and so on. If we are using 10 rolls it will be: first row 1, second row 2, third row 3, fourth row 4. Balance them so they're freestanding. Step 4: Mark the \\"alley\\": You may use a masking tape or any other form of marker to indicate the bowling alley. This gives a boundary for the game and makes it more realistic and interesting. Step 5: Choose the Ball: Use a ball that's not too heavy but has enough weight to knock over the tp rolls. A tennis ball would usually work just fine.  Step 6: Set up the Rules: Now it's time to set the rules. They can be simple as you get 2 turns per round to knock all the pins. And you can count 1 point for each roll knocked over. Step 7: Play: Now you are all set to play. Take turns and bowl across the flat surface to knock over the toilet paper rolls. Step 8: Score Tracking: Make sure to track the score. Whoever knocks down the most \\"pins\\" by the end of the game wins.

Translate to English","output":"The officials, fearful of the presence of the H5 virus in birds, had exterminated the remainder of the flock, disinfected the area, and established a protective zone of 3 kilometers. The H5 virus, also known as Avian Influenza or Bird Flu, is a type of influenza virus that primarily affects birds. In extreme instances, it can cross species barriers and infect humans as well. The early detection of such virus in a bird population is crucial to prevent a potential outbreak and subsequent transmission to humans.  More specifically, H5N1 is a subtype of this virus that has caused the most serious health concerns worldwide, due to its ability to cause severe disease and high mortality rate among humans. Therefore, the actions taken by the officials in this situation were to minimize the risk of the disease spreading. Upon detection of the virus in a bird, swift action would have been necessary. In this case, the authorities killed the rest of the birds in the flock. This would have been done to eliminate the chance of further transmission within the bird population and to protect other wildlife and humans in the vicinity.  Dissemination of the virus can occur through infected birds' saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Thus, by euthanizing the birds, the officials would be stopping the spread at its source. Next, they disinfected the area. This step would be vital to kill any remaining virus that could be lurking on surfaces. The cleaning process would usually involve the use of strong disinfectants specified for disease control in a prescribed manner to ensure thorough cleaning and sanitation. Finally, they established a protective zone spanning 3 kilometers. This biosecurity measure would have been designed to isolate the affected area and monitor it closely. A ban would likely be enforced on transporting birds into or out of this zone.  All these measures would help in curtailing the spread of the virus further, thus protecting the health of humans and animals alike in the surrounding areas.

Summarize this article: Apply the glue and trim to 1 side of the label at a time. If you are decorating the front label, consider doing 3 rows of rhinestone trim. Use a thin trim for the first and third rows, and a larger trim for the middle row. Use a thin, simple trim for the back label. You don't have to use rhinestones for the middle row. Try pearls or even studs! Some bottles have a round stamp or seal near the top, right between the neck and label. Choose a large rhinestone, then glue it right over the stamp or seal. Glue 1 to 2 rows of tiny rhinestones around the larger one for a fancier look.  The large rhinestone should be large enough to cover the stamp or seal. For more variation, use tiny pearls for the first row, and silver rhinestones for the second row. If all of your rhinestones are the same shape, size, and color, your bottle may look monotonous. Give the bottle a quick coat of a clear-drying glue or spray sealer, then shake some glitter onto it. This works especially well over smooth, pearl trims.  If you are using spray sealer, it must be glossy, or you will dull down the rhinestones. Use glitter that is the same color as your rhinestones to help blend it in some more. Extra-fine glitter will look pretty, but you can use chunky glitter instead, or even a combination of both! If you covered your entire bottle with rhinestones, it may look a little monotonous. Let the bottle dry first, then add larger rhinestones, gemstones, or flat-backed pearls on top. Use these sparingly; do not cover the entire bottle with these. This works especially well over a pearl trim. The rhinestones will help add some texture. Cut a length of ribbon and tie it into a bow. Glue the bow to the neck of bottle, then cut the tails of the bow into angles.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN) -- At age of 52, it might be too late to re-visit your beliefs and principles in order to change them. When you see the regression from where we were, to the situation now and realize the dream you have been working towards has moved almost entirely out-of-reach, you feel tired, hopeless, and less motivated to recharge yourself. I was born in Gaza in 1962 to a refugee family who had been expelled from their village \\"Sawafir\\" in the then British --mandate of Palestine. Five years later, in June 1967, Gaza was occupied by Israel, which meant that I grew up under the occupation. When you live under occupation, your national ambitions become clearer and stronger. And in OPTIONS: - British, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - CNN, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Gaza, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Israel, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Omar Shaban, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Palestine, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Palestinian, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. - Sawafir, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians.","output":"...in Palestine, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. This competition fuels tension and unrest within the region, further complicating any hope for peace and stability. As a Palestinian who has experienced these hardships firsthand, I can attest to the emotional and psychological toll that living under occupation takes on an individual and the community as a whole. Throughout my life, I have witnessed various political factions and extremist groups vying for power and influence, often at the expense of innocent civilians. This competition is a driving force behind the perpetuation of hostilities and the seemingly intractable nature of the conflict. What began as a struggle for self-determination and basic human rights has devolved into a cycle of violence and aggression that leaves the average Palestinian feeling increasingly isolated and disenfranchised. As a native of the region, I have observed firsthand the damage done by such political maneuvering. For instance, the Hamas takeover of Gaza in 2007 effectively divided the Palestinian Territories and hampered any efforts to establish a unified, cohesive government. In the absence of a strong, unified voice for all Palestinians, these political squabbles continue unabated, impeding any progress toward a peaceful resolution. In the meantime, the impact of this ongoing conflict is felt acutely by the Palestinian people, particularly in areas like Gaza, which has become effectively isolated from the rest of the world. The crippling blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt has made it exceedingly difficult for Gazans to access basic necessities or to rebuild their lives in the wake of multiple conflicts. Moreover, the devastating effects of war have also led to rampant poverty, unemployment, and poor infrastructure, eroding any semblance of normalcy or stability for the people in the affected areas. In the face of such insurmountable challenges, it is understandable that one might feel disheartened and pessimistic about the prospect of change. However, I believe that it is never too late to revisit one's principles and strive for a better future. To achieve lasting peace in the region, a shift in mindset and approach will be required, emphasizing dialogue and cooperation over aggression and hostility. The international community must also play a key role in moderating the conflict and fostering conditions conducive to negotiation and compromise. In conclusion, while it may be tempting to succumb to feelings of hopelessness in the face of ongoing hostility and political posturing, I maintain that it is never too late to challenge and re-evaluate one's beliefs and principles. After all, it is through the questioning of long-held assumptions and the pursuit of understanding that genuine change and progress can be achieved. Even within the tumultuous landscape of Palestine, where politicians and groups vie for power and influence by demonstrating aggression toward the Palestinians, the possibility of finding a path towards peace and understanding remains – for both Palestinians and Israelis alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Maya Angelou ( ( listen); born Marguerite Annie Johnson; April 4, 1928 - May 28, 2014) was an American poet, singer, memoirist, and civil rights activist. She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and was credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. In 1951, Angelou married Greek electrician, former sailor, and aspiring musician Tosh Angelos, despite the condemnation of interracial relationships at the time and the disapproval of her mother. She took modern dance classes during this time, and met dancers and choreographers Alvin Ailey and Ruth Beckford. Angelou and Ailey formed a dance team, calling themselves \\"Al and Rita\\", and performed modern dance at fraternal black organizations throughout San Francisco, but never became successful. Angelou, her new husband, and her son moved to New York City so she could study African dance with Trinidadian dancer Pearl Primus, but they returned to San Francisco a year later.  After Angelou's marriage ended in 1954, she danced professionally in clubs around San Francisco, including the nightclub the Purple Onion, where she sang and danced to calypso music. Up to that point she went by the name of \\"Marguerite Johnson\\", or \\"Rita\\", but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters at the Purple Onion she changed her professional name to \\"Maya Angelou\\" (her nickname and former married surname), a \\"distinctive name\\" that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances. During 1954 and 1955, Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess. She began her practice of learning the language of every country she visited, and in a few years she gained proficiency in several languages. In 1957, riding on the popularity of calypso, Angelou recorded her first album, Miss Calypso, which was reissued as a CD in 1996. She appeared in an off-Broadway review that inspired the 1957 film Calypso Heat Wave, in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions.  Angelou met novelist John Oliver Killens in 1959 and, at his urging, moved to New York to concentrate on her writing career. She joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met several major African-American authors, including John Henrik Clarke, Rosa Guy, Paule Marshall, and Julian Mayfield, and was published for the first time. In 1960, after meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and hearing him speak, she and Killens organized \\"the legendary\\" Cabaret for Freedom to benefit the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and she was named SCLC's Northern Coordinator. According to scholar Lyman B. Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and \\"eminently effective\\".

These beliefs can lead to social pressures even within the same group, if some members are darker than others. The result is that skin lightening has become very common across Africa, Asia and other areas of the world and more people with dark skin are using skin-lighting products, even if it means they may face health risks. They believe that having whiter skin will improve the quality of their lives. Many people think they will have a better family. Or they want to look like what their society generally considers beautiful. Some beauty care  products and soaps contain chemicals that make skin lighter. However, some of the chemicals are extremely dangerous. The chemicals in the products block and break down the natural barrier  to protect against sunlight. Then the skin can become thick and discolored. Usually the person will use more of the product in an effort to correct the problem, which just makes things even worse. Doctor Ly says some chemicals are so dangerous that they may lead to blackened fingernails, infections  and serious skin damage. And these are not the only problems.

The site has been home to protestors since drilling began in July, and 124 arrests have been made so far, including that of Green MP Caroline Lucas. Body: Following the lack of expected results from initial drills, energy company Cuadrilla began the process of removing its exploratory drilling equipment from a site in Balcombe, West Sussex. To ensure smooth and secure transportation, police officers from four different forces were called in to marshal the equipment as it was driven from the site. The Balcombe location has been the epicenter of protests since Cuadrilla commenced drilling operations in July, attracting activists who oppose the company's fracking activities. However, only a few demonstrators attended the latest development, resulting in the arrest of two individuals. Since the start of the drilling, a total of 124 people have been arrested at the site for various reasons, one of them being Green MP Caroline Lucas. The arrests made throughout the months, coupled with the increased police assistance to remove the drilling equipment, show the intensity of the situation that has been brewing at the Balcombe site. Cuadrilla stated that it is unlikely to continue using the Balcombe site for fracking activities in the future. The decision was made after the initial drill tests were not as fruitful as the company had initially hoped. The removal of drilling equipment and the possibility of ceasing fracking activities at the site may mark a new phase in the ongoing debate surrounding the controversial energy exploration method. As Cuadrilla evaluates its future plans for the location, it remains to be seen if a resolution may be reached between the company, protestors, and the local community."},{"instruction":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How may individual Jehovah's Witnesses specify what blood treatments they are willing to accept?\\" is in \\"Though Jehovah's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood, they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion.

We have the equation: -27 = 9 * p - 27 First, let's focus on the \\"- 27\\" part at the end of the equation. We want to move it over to the other side to help us find the value of p.

Since 9 is multiplying with p, we can get p alone by dividing both sides of the equation by 9: 0 / 9 = (9 * p) / 9 0 divided by any number is still 0: 0 = p There we go! We found the value of p!

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Technically, the answer to these two questions could indeed be similar, because both are requesting information related to the methods or approaches one can take to empathize with others.  Here's the thought process or strategy around this: 1. Understand the questions: The first question \\"What are some ways to empathize?\\" is asking for different methods or techniques that can be used to empathize. Conversely, the second question \\"How do you empathize with people?\\" seems more personal, as if asking for your own individual methods of empathizing.  2. Recognize the overlap: Both questions revolve around the concept of empathy and seek to understand methods or approaches to achieve it.  3. Synthesize the answer: Based on the overlap, it can be inferred that both questions could receive the same or a very similar response. So, in essence, while the two questions are phrased differently, they are indeed similar in nature and can be answered in much the same way, as they both ask about ways to empathize.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. There are a few different products you can choose from to add a bit of shine and start blending your eyeliner. Note that this isn’t the actual gloss, but will add a bit of luster to get you started. For this, you want to use a wax-based product that isn’t overly sticky. A wax-based product like MAC’s Mixing Medium Shine is ideal. If you don’t want to shell out the cash for a designer product, you can use some waxy lip balm to create the same effect. If you’re trying this look out for the first time, it might be wise to save the cash and try creating it with cheaper products. If you love the look and want to wear it often, however, it’s worth investing in the longer-lasting products that are created specifically for the eyes. Whether you’re using the MAC product or a bit of balm, you’ll apply it the same way. Get a bit of the product on your fingertip and press it onto your eyelid. Using a light hand, carefully use the product to smudge out the kohl eyeliner you previously applied. Gently pull the eyeliner up the lid to create a softer, smokier effect. If you want your lash line to be darkest, you can certainly add a bit more eyeliner to your lash line after you’ve smudged it out a bit. Remember, though, that this look really isn’t about precision or stark lines. Finally, after you’ve blended your eyeliner and laid a shiny foundation, it’s time to apply your gloss. There are a few different eye glosses on the market, like MAC Eye Gloss, NYX Lid Lacquer, MAKE Face Gloss, and Glossier Balm Dotcom. You can find a variety of glosses online or at your local beauty supply store. Use a flat brush or your finger to apply the gloss over your entire lid. Start in the middle and carefully sweep it outwards.  If you’re worried about your eyelids feeling sticky, avoid applying any product to the crease. Smooth the product to your lid below the crease and a bit above the crease, but don’t put any directly in it!  If you don’t want to buy a product meant specifically for your eye, you can always use a clear lip gloss or Vaseline-type product instead. Summary:","output":"To add shine and blend your eyeliner, you can use a wax-based product like MAC's Mixing Medium Shine or a waxy lip balm.

Wear lip balm. Stay dry. Don't forget sunscreen on clear, cold days.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Keep Your Skin Protected: Tips for Healthy Skin in Every Weather Introduction Your skin is the largest organ of your body, and taking care of it should be a top priority. Skin protects you from various environmental factors and helps regulate body temperature, among other essential functions. However, many people overlook the importance of a proper skin care routine, especially during varying weather conditions. Inadequate skin care can lead to numerous issues such as dryness, fine lines, and even skin cancer. By following a few simple tips, you can protect your skin and keep it looking healthy—no matter what Mother Nature has in store. 1. Cover up!   One of the best ways to protect your skin against the harsh elements is to cover it up with clothing. You don't need to have a heavy coat on every day, but ensuring that skin that is prone to sunburn or chapping is covered can help keep it protected. Consider wearing hats, gloves, and long-sleeved shirts, especially when it is cold or windy, to provide a physical barrier against the elements. 2. Use a moisturizer No matter the weather, a good moisturizer is essential for maintaining healthy skin. In cold or dry conditions, a thick moisturizer can help protect against chapping and flaking, while a lightweight formula will suit warm or humid climates. Applying moisturizer regularly helps maintain your skin's natural moisture balance, and will leave you with a silky, soft complexion. 3. Wear lip balm  Your lips are exceptionally delicate, and just as vulnerable to harsh weather conditions as the rest of your skin. But a good moisturizer might not provide enough protection for them. For that reason, using a lip balm is crucial for maintaining healthy lips. Choose a balm that contains SPF for added protection against sun damage, and apply it throughout the day to keep your lips smooth, soft, and protected.  4. Stay dry Damp skin is a breeding ground for bacteria and can lead to various skin problems. Make sure to thoroughly dry your skin after bathing or sweating to minimize the risk of infections. This is particularly important in moist and humid environments. Carry an extra towel with you during the day if necessary. 5. Don't forget sunscreen on clear, cold days It's a common misconception that sunscreen is only necessary during the hot and sunny summer months. However, ultraviolet (UV) radiation can be just as harmful during cold, clear days. In fact, snow can even reflect up to 80% of the UV rays, increasing your exposure. Therefore, be sure to apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all exposed skin, even during colder months. This will protect you from sunburn, premature aging, and skin cancer. Conclusion By following these simple yet effective tips, you can keep your skin looking and feeling its best through all the different season. Remember, healthy skin starts with proper care and protection, so make it a priority to give your skin the care it needs to thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Megan had always wanted to learn how to swim so they asked Lindsey for lessons.","output":"Megan had always wanted to learn how to swim, so they asked Lindsey for lessons. Lindsey, an excellent swimmer and certified lifeguard, was well-known for her expertise in the water. She had been swimming since she was a toddler and had a real affinity for the sport. Lindsey loved teaching others how to swim and eagerly agreed to help Megan. Megan and Lindsey decided that the best place to start was the community pool. It was a spot frequented by locals during the summer months, offering various classes, including swimming lessons for children and adults. The pool had a shallow end for beginners, a deeper area for more experienced swimmers, as well as a diving board and a separate area for water sports. Before their first lesson, Lindsey advised Megan on what to wear and what to bring to the pool. Megan needed a comfortable swimsuit, goggles, a swim cap to keep their hair dry, and a towel to dry off after the lesson. Lindsey also recommended that Megan invest in some swim fins and a kickboard to help with technique later on. For their initial lesson, Lindsey focused on helping Megan become comfortable in the water. They began in the shallow end of the pool, where Lindsey taught Megan how to breathe correctly while keeping their face in the water. Soon, Megan was able to float on their back and practice breathing techniques more easily. In the following lessons, Lindsey helped Megan master the four basic swimming strokes: freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly. Freestyle, also known as front crawl, involved alternating arm strokes, with legs kicking in a flutter kick motion. The breaststroke required a simultaneous arm pull and frog kick, encouraging Megan to glide smoothly on the water’s surface. The backstroke allowed Megan to swim with their face above the water, relying on a scissor-like kick and long arm strokes. Lastly, the butterfly stroke proved the most challenging of all. It demanded a powerful dolphin kick and a simultaneous overhead arm pull. Lindsey knew that it took time to learn the butterfly stroke, but, with practice, Megan would eventually grasp it. Along with learning the strokes, Megan wanted to know how to tread water. Lindsey shared techniques for staying afloat without expending too much energy, such as the eggbeater kick, which involved moving the legs in opposite circular motions. As Megan's confidence and skills grew, Lindsey began incorporating swimming drills. She designed these exercises to improve Megan's endurance, strength, and speed in the water. For instance, Megan learned how to streamline—a proper body position for cutting through the water—and practiced this with a series of underwater dolphin kicks. With each lesson, Megan found their love for swimming growing. The sense of accomplishment from mastering new skills, as well as the calming effect of being in the water, was invigorating. Lindsey was a patient and supportive teacher, always encouraging Megan to challenge themselves and celebrate their achievements. After several weeks of training together, Megan felt ready to tackle new swimming goals. They decided to join a local masters swimming team, where they could continue refining their technique, swim with other enthusiasts, and even participate in competitive swim meets. Megan's determination, coupled with Lindsey's guidance, transformed a once-unattainable dream into reality. By conquering their fear and developing a passion for swimming, Megan not only learned an essential life skill but also discovered a new world of enjoyment and possibility."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first six presidents of the United States did not make extensive use of the veto power: George Washington only vetoed two bills, James Monroe one, and John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams none.

These two cities are on opposite sides of the planet, but both wildfires are nearly identical in terms of scope and intensity. So, when it's daytime in Milton, it's nighttime in Parth. New firefighters in Milton are currently arriving at the scene of the fire as the sun beats down directly above them. They are getting instructions from their boss about what they need to do today and preparing themselves for a long day.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Are air currents in Parth traveling uphill or downhill?  Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. Answer:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph above, we can infer that the air currents in Parth are traveling downhill. Since it is currently daytime in Milton and nighttime in Parth, the temperature and conditions in Parth will be cooler in comparison. The sunlight has been warming the ground in Milton, causing air currents to travel uphill, whereas in Parth, the lack of sunlight and cooler nighttime temperatures cause the air currents to travel downhill. This is because the ground in Parth will be cooling off, leading to a downward flow of air currents. These air currents tend to fan the wildfires and often follow their path over hills and through valleys. So, as it is nighttime in Parth, the air currents are most likely traveling downhill."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Obsession comes in many flavors, and exists for a variety of reasons; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder, but for others it may be an avenue of survival. Lack of nurturing, combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements, may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone. And in extreme cases, the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession, driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing, and as we discover in \`The Luzhin Defence,' directed by Marleen Gorris, a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem, and in fact, may actually exacerbate the situation. Obsession, it seems, has no prejudice or preference; moreover, it gives no quarter. \\tAt an Italian resort in the 1920's, Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament, the winner of which will be the World Champion. Luzhin is a Master of the game, but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him; rather, it is his obsession, that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life, and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family. So Luzhin is a genius with an Achilles heel, a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands, and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament. That man is Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), Luzhin's former mentor, who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to Luzhin. \\tValentinov is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to Luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him. Not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament, Turati (Fabio Sartor), against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours, but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort, Natalia (Emily Watson). And, genius though he may be, dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push Luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace, as well the curse, of his entire life. \\tTo tell Luzhin's story, Gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess. And as his background is established, it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who Luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life. For the scenes of his childhood, Gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into, and underlies, the present, more pastoral setting of the resort. The transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled, and with the pace Gorris sets it makes for a riveting, yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well. She also underplays the menace produced by the presence of Valentinov, concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense, which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film, making Luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling. \\tThe single element that makes this film so memorable, however, is the affecting performance of John Turturro. For this film to work, Luzhin must be absolutely believable; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous, as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately. It doesn't happen, however, and the film does work, because the Luzhin Turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life. He captures Luzhin's genius, as well as his inadequacies, and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real. It's a performance equal to, if not surpassing, Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of David Helfgott in \`Shine.' And when you compare his work here with other characters he's created, from Sid Lidz in \`Unstrung Heroes' to Pete in \`O Brother Where Art Thou?' to Al Fountain in \`Box of Moonlight,' you realize what an incredible range Turturro has as an actor, and what a remarkable artist he truly is. \\tAs Natalia, Emily Watson is excellent, as well, turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely. Though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to Luzhin, Watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective. Most importantly, because of the detail she brings to her performance, it makes her accelerated relationship with Luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story. You have but to look into Watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real. It's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor. \\tThe supporting cast includes Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark Tandy (Luzhin's Father), Kelly Hunter (Luzhin's Mother), Alexander Hunting (Young Luzhin) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci). Well crafted and delivered, \`The Luzhin Defence' is an emotionally involving film, presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man. We don't need a movie, of course, to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget, inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change, and to make a difference in the lives of those around us.

A federal judge on... (Associated Press)      ST. LOUIS (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday approved a settlement in the wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the parents of Michael Brown, an unarmed, black 18-year-old, whose fatal shooting by a white police officer nearly three years ago in Ferguson, Missouri, set off months of protests.      Financial terms of the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber were not disclosed. Anthony Gray, the attorney for Brown's parents, declined comment, as did Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III.      Michael Brown Sr. and Lezley McSpadden sued the city, former Police Chief Tom Jackson and former police officer Darren Wilson in 2015. They argued that the death of their son deprived them of financial support through his future potential wages.      Their lawsuit also described the police culture in Ferguson as hostile to black residents, and said Wilson used excessive and unreasonable force in fatally shooting Brown during an Aug. 9, 2014, confrontation on a street.      Ferguson, Jackson and Wilson denied the allegations.      Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing, but the shooting led to sometimes violent unrest in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. Wilson resigned from the police force in November 2014, soon after a St. Louis County grand jury announced he would not be indicted. The U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson.      But the investigation led to a Justice Department lawsuit over racially biased police and court practices. A settlement calls for significant changes in operations, including sensitivity training for officers, adoption of community policing techniques, court reforms and other measures.      The process is expected to cost more than 2 million and could take years.      Webber's three-page ruling discloses nothing about the settlement amount, but said it is \\"fair and reasonable compensation for this wrongful death claim and is in the best interests of each Plaintiff,\\" with the money to be split between Michael Brown Sr. and McSpadden.      Webber also wrote that the agreement \\"shall remain sealed by this Court and shall be considered a closed record\\" because disclosure of the information \\"could jeopardize the safety of individuals involved in this matter, whether as witnesses, parties, or investigators.\\" He did not elaborate.      Settlements involving public money and public entities such as cities are typically open under Missouri law, but Webber wrote that the value of opening the record \\"is outweighed by the adverse impact to Plaintiffs.\\" ||||| FERGUSON • An insurance company for Ferguson has agreed to pay 1.5 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of Michael Brown over his 2014 death, a lawyer said Friday.      Ferguson City Attorney Apollo Carey told the Post-Dispatch in an email Friday morning that the insurance company paid 1.5 million \\"on behalf of multiple defendants.\\" Brown's parents were suing the city, former Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson and former police Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Brown.      U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber approved the secret settlement Tuesday. In his order, Webber did not mention the amount, writing only that it is “fair and reasonable compensation for this wrongful death claim and is in the best interests of each Plaintiff.”      Webber said the split of the amount between Michael Brown Sr. and Lezley McSpadden “is fair and reasonable,” and the agreement “provides for a reasonable amount” for attorney fees and expenses.      Settlements involving public entities are generally open records under Missouri law, but Webber ordered the agreement sealed and said that it should be considered a closed record under the Law “due to the adverse impact to Plaintiffs should it be disclosed.\\"      \\"Disclosure of the terms of the settlement agreement,\\" Webber wrote, \\"could jeopardize the safety of individuals involved in this matter, whether as witnesses, parties, or investigators. The public policy to consider records open is outweighed by the adverse impact to Plaintiffs.\\"      State law does require that the settlement amount be released, and Carey disclosed the amount after open records requests from the Post-Dispatch and at least one other media organization, the Associated Press.      The Post-Dispatch reported on Monday that a settlement was near, and that it would be less than the 3 million limit of the city's insurance.      Lawyers on both sides, and a board member of the insurance company, declined in recent days to comment on any aspect of the settlement or what led to it.      All sides faced risks if they took the case to trial.      Peter Joy, professor at the Washington University School of Law, said that had the city lost, the insurance company would have paid any judgment up to the 3 million limit, but Ferguson would have had to pay any amount above that.      They would also have to pay lawyers fees and costs.      A trial alone could have cost 100,000 for just one side, he said, and he guessed that they'd already “sunk a lot of money into it to get to this point.”      From the Brown's family's perspective, they could have lost at the trial, or they could have prevailed but been awarded less than the 1.5 million, he said.      Plaintiff's lawyers working on a contingency basis typically take 33-40 percent of a settlement, and then the plaintiffs have to pay costs and any taxes, Joy said.      The Brown family's 2016 lawsuit says that a police culture of pervasive hostility toward African-Americans led to the death of Brown, 18, on Aug. 9, 2014. Wilson used excessive and unreasonable force, the suit says.      Ferguson, Jackson and Wilson denied the claims in court documents. A St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute him, saying evidence and “credible” witnesses supported Wilson’s claims that Brown attacked him. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A federal judge has approved a 1.5 million settlement in the wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the parents of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager whose fatal shooting by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 sparked months of protests.

Article: Thinking is something you choose to do as a fish chooses to live in water. To be human is to think. But thinking may come naturally without your knowing how you do it. Thinking about thinking is the key to critical thinking. When you think critically, you take control of your thinking processes . Otherwise, you might be controlled by the ideas of others. Indeed, critical thinking is at the heart of education. The word \\"critical\\" here has a special meaning. It does not mean taking one view against another view, as when someone criticizes another person for doing something wrong. The nature of critical thinking is thinking beyond the easily seen--beyond the pictures on TV, the untrue reports in the newspapers, and the faulty reasoning  . Critical thinking is an attitude as much as an activity. If you are curious about life and desire to dig deeper into it, you are a critical thinker; if you find pleasure in deep thinking about different ideas, characters, and facts, you are a critical thinker. Activities of the mind and higher-order reasoning are processes of deep and careful consideration. They take time, and do not go hand in hand with the fast speed in today's world, fast foods, instant coffee, and self-developing film. If you are among the people who believe that speed is a measure of intelligence, you may learn _ from a story about Albert Einstein. The first time Banish Hoffman, a scientist, was to discuss his work with Albert Einstein, Hoffman was too nervous to speak. But Einstein immediately put Hoffman at ease by saying, \\"Please go slowly, I don't understand things quickly.\\" Question: What would be the best title for the passage?

Options: - spend - pass course - keep - create art - pocket A:","output":"The rich kid thought he could offer the professor money, and in turn, the professor would let him pass the course. This option is in line with common sense because it shows the typical assumption that someone with money may try to use their financial resources to their advantage, particularly in a situation where they might be struggling academically. If a rich kid were to offer a professor money, it would most likely be with the intent of receiving some sort of favor or leniency regarding their academic performance, such as passing a course without meeting the actual requirements or receiving a higher grade than deserved. Options like \\"spend,\\" \\"keep,\\" \\"create art,\\" and \\"pocket\\" do not involve a direct academic benefit but could potentially bring other types of benefits or be part of different situations. However, in the context of a rich kid bribing a professor, it is sensible to assume that the primary objective would be to pass the course. From an ethical standpoint, it's important to mention that offering money or bribes for favorable academic results is unacceptable and a violation of academic integrity. Students should strive to succeed in their courses through their own hard work, commitment, and effort.

Jouvet Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Elusive Chase\\" Genre: Mystery/Comedy/Crime Plot Summary: In \\"The Elusive Chase,\\" Inspector Jouvet, a determined French police officer, hopes to find the renowned but clumsy Inspector Clouseau alive after he disappeared while working on a high-profile case. As Jouvet puts together his investigation, he finds clues that suggest Clouseau may still be alive and embarks on a race against time to unravel the truth. Along the way, he faces his own chaotic encounters, as Clouseau's clumsiness seems to be contagious. Plot: The film begins with a flashback, showing Inspector Clouseau's (Peter Sellers) last case before his disappearance. Clouseau was assigned a mission to uncover the mastermind behind a notorious crime syndicate involved in a series of art heists across France. Despite his best efforts, the case goes cold, and Clouseau disappears without a trace. Several years later, Inspector Jouvet (Jean Reno) is assigned to reopen Clouseau's cold case. He is a devoted fan of Clouseau's work and develops a hunch that Clouseau may still be alive, albeit in hiding. Jouvet enlists the help of Clouseau's former partner, Detective Ponton (André Dussollier), who reluctantly agrees to aid in the investigation. With Ponton's help, Jouvet discovers a series of cryptic messages left by Clouseau at key crime scene locations. These messages, in Clouseau's clumsy yet endearing fashion, lead Jouvet and Ponton closer to the elusive crime lord behind the heists. However, this also leads to them crossing paths with dangerous criminals and getting entangled in precarious situations that echo Clouseau's infamous clumsiness. As Jouvet digs deeper into the case, he starts to suspect that Clouseau may be more involved in the crime syndicate than he initially assumed. As his admiration for Clouseau shifts, he becomes obsessed with solving the case and proving Clouseau's innocence.  After a wild goose chase filled with comedic twists and turns, Jouvet and Ponton finally uncover the crime lord's identity, played by Tchéky Karyo. He is a sophisticated art collector attempting to create the perfect collection by commissioning the thefts of famous artworks. They manage to infiltrate the crime lord's lair and discover that Clouseau had been secretly living among the criminals, working undercover to dismantle the operation and bring the kingpin to justice. In a climactic confrontation, Jouvet and Ponton, together with Clouseau, outsmart the crime lord, resulting in his arrest and the recovery of several stolen artworks. They save Clouseau from a sticky situation, and he finally gets the gratitude of his superiors. In the end, the legacy of Clouseau is redeemed, and Jouvet restores his faith in his idol. As a fitting tribute, Clouseau takes Jouvet under his wing, recognizing the young inspector as a worthy successor in the pursuit of justice. In turn, Jouvet learns that while Clouseau's methods may be unconventional, his dedication to fighting crime is unparalleled — a lesson he will take on throughout his career. \\"The Elusive Chase\\" combines the iconic slapstick humor of the classic Pink Panther films with a fresh twist, exploring the importance of trusting one's instincts and the mentor-mentee relationship. The film is filled with thrilling action, suspenseful crime-solving, and heartwarming comedy, appealing to both fans of the original series and new audiences alike."},{"instruction":"Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery.

The administration decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war. In 1917 10 million men were registered. This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3 million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted , compared to 2,442,586 white . Forms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for \\"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\\". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the Selective Draft Law Cases on January 7, 1918.
