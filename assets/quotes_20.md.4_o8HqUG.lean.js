Information:  - Ensemble Studios was a video game developer initially established in 1995 as an independent company by Tony Goodman, Rick Goodman and John Boog-Scott, but was acquired by Microsoft in 2001 and operated as an internal studio until 2009, when it was officially disbanded. Ensemble developed many real-time strategy games, including the \\"Age of Empires\\" game series, \\"Age of Mythology\\", and \\"Halo Wars\\". In addition to game development, Ensemble Studios also made the Genie Game Engine used in \\"Age of Empires\\", \\"\\", and \\"\\". The studio sold 20 million games and was worth an estimated 500 million.  - JoWooD Entertainment AG (formerly JoWooD Productions Software AG, commonly referred to as JoWooD) was an Austrian video game publisher that was founded in 1995. JoWooD went into administration and all assets were purchased by Nordic Games.  - An expansion pack, expansion set, supplement, or simply expansion is an addition to an existing role-playing game, tabletop game or video game. These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters and/or an extended storyline to complete an already released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, (see \\"\\" for \\"Diablo\\"), it may choose to develop the expansion itself or it may do both (Ensemble Studios developed the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III and the first expansion called itself, but contracted Big Huge Games for the second expansion pack, the Asian Dynasties). Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the \\"Dragon Slayer\\" games \\"\\" and \\"Sorcerian\\".  - Gothic II : Night of the Raven ( German : Die Nacht Des Raben ) , often abbreviated as NotR , is the official expansion pack of the German role - playing video game Gothic II. The expansion focuses on further enlarging the story already presented in the original Gothic II game , by adding a new world called Jharkendar , new attributes , items , and weapons . Upon its first release in 2003 the game was available in the German language only , the English version only being released in 2005 , as part of the Gothic II Gold package .  - Big Huge Games is a video game developer located in Timonium, Maryland. The company was founded in February 2000 by four veteran game industry developers: Tim Train, David Inscore, Jason Coleman and Brian Reynolds (lead designer of \\"Alpha Centauri\\", et al.). Their first game, \\"Rise of Nations\\", was a critical and commercial hit. The original studio became defunct in May 2012, but the name \\"Big Huge Games\\" was later reacquired by Reynolds and Train for their new venture (previously known as SecretNewCo). The revived studio released the mobile game \\"DomiNations\\" on Android and iOS in April 2015.  - In , Falcom released \\"Sorcerian Forever\\" for Microsoft Windows-based PCs. In , Falcom released \\"Sorcerian Original\\", a remake of Sorcerian for Microsoft Windows-based PCs. In addition, console versions of Sorcerian with somewhat differing content from their PC counterparts were developed: A version for the Mega Drive was developed by Sega, a version for the PC Engine CD was developed by Victor Musical Industries, and a version for the Dreamcast was developed by Victor Interactive Software.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - Gothic II is a role-playing video game and the sequel to \\"Gothic\\", by the German developer Piranha Bytes.

After watching the Republican candidates lock the kryptonite that is the immigration issue around their necks during the Arizona debate, my bet is that President Barack Obama could win another term -- even if he loses key swing states such as Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin -- but he must make sure he accomplishes one thing first: Connect with Latinos. Republicans have not connected with Hispanics; the candidates' approaches to immigration are not compelling and lack substance, from talk of double 30-foot electrified fences to anchor babies and self-deportation. In fact, it could very well be that the 20 Arizona Latino voters on the cover of TIME and half a million more will turn out to vote in Arizona and flip the state to Obama.

However, most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity. Necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter (\\"push\\" motivations), whereas opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations (\\"pull\\") such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products, services, or underserved market needs. The economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth. Question: What type of motivators are achievement and self determination considered? Solution:","output":"Part #1: Passage given for reference.

Options: - hugging - introducing yourself - making friends - smiling - shake hands  Explain why a human would choose \\"introducing yourself\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"Introducing yourself A human would choose \\"introducing yourself\\" as the correct answer because it is the most appropriate and effective way to initiate a conversation when meeting new people. When you introduce yourself, you share your name and relevant details, which helps establish your identity and connection with others. It sets the foundation for further interactions and helps create a comfortable atmosphere. While the other options like hugging, making friends, smiling, and shaking hands are also ways people may interact when meeting for the first time, they are more situational and may not apply in every scenario. Hugging, for instance, could be considered inappropriate or invasive in some cultures and instances. Making friends is an outcome rather than an action, and smiling and shaking hands are supplementary gestures that enhance the social interaction. Introducing yourself is the most universally accepted and essential action when meeting new people."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It was an alliance between Country Club Episcopalians and twice born followers of the Old Time Gospel, all firmly opposed to mass Catholic immigration from Europe. The nativism of the GOP drove Catholics into the welcoming arms of Al Smith, Jack Kennedy, Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Party. But this year's GOP front-runners are a Mormon and two Catholics -- Rick Santorum (a cradle of Italian descent) and Newt Gingrich (a convert). Roughly one-quarter of Republican primary voters are Catholic. Notable Catholic GOP leaders include John Boehner, Paul Ryan, Christine O'Donnell, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush.

There are several indicators in the text that point towards this conclusion. First, mentioning rain and storms suggests that the area has been affected by heavy precipitation, which could lead to flooding or be the consequence of a hurricane. Additionally, the need to turn on the air conditioning after not having power to make the home comfortable implies that it might have been flooded or exposed to heavy moisture, causing humidity inside the house. Furthermore, the mention of pulling up carpets and cleaning fallen insulation also points towards the possibility of a natural disaster like a hurricane or flood damaging the house. When a hurricane or flood affects a home, the walls, floors, carpets, and insulation are often damaged by water and wind, necessitating repairs and replacements. The other options provided do not align with the given information as well as the flood or hurricane scenario. Option (B) about vandalism does not correspond with the mention of rain, storms, and the need to clean up insulation. Option (C) about the home being new and waiting to move in does not match with turning on the AC and dealing with carpets and fallen insulation, both of which indicate the presence of damage. Finally, option (D) is not suitable since there are clear issues linked to weather and home damage described in the text.

The Caucasus or Caucasia is a region situated at the border of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It is home to the Caucasus Mountains, which contain Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, , located on the west of the Greater Caucasus mountain range. The Greater Caucasus acts as a natural barrier separating Europe from Southwest Asia, the latter including the Transcaucasus and Anatolia regions.  The Caucasus region is separated between northern and southern partsthe North Caucasus and Transcaucasus, respectively. The Greater Caucasus range in the north is within the Russian Federation, while the Lesser Caucasus to the south is divided between several independent states, namely Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan. The Transcaucasus extends eastwards to the Caspian Sea and northwestern Iran, and extends westwards into northeastern Turkey.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Becky Evans. PUBLISHED:. 11:32 EST, 10 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 14:30 EST, 10 April 2013. A midwife has apologised today for telling an Indian woman who was suffering a miscarriage that she could not have a termination in Ireland because it was a 'Catholic thing'. Ann Maria Burke admitted she made the remark to Savita Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway but insisted she meant it in kindness. The patient later died of septicemia. The senior midwife said she used the reference to Catholic teaching after the 31-year-old dentist said she was Hindu and she would have ended her pregnancy in her home country. Midwife Ann Maria Burke, pictured outside Galway Coroners court, apologised for telling Savita Halappanavar she could not have a termination because it was a 'Catholic thing' Savita Halappanavar died of a heart attack caused by septicaemia after being refused an abortion and delivering a dead baby. 'I did mention it’s a Catholic country,' Ms Burke told Galway coroner Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin. 'I didn’t mention it in a hurtful context. It was in a conversation we had.' Ms Burke said she regrets making the statement, which the coroner said 'went around the world'. 'I’m sorry that I said it,' she added. Mrs Halappanavar, 31, was admitted to hospital on Sunday, October 21 and delivered a dead baby daughter three days later. She died the following Sunday of a heart attack caused by septicaemia due to E.coli. The inquest, in its third day at Galway courthouse, has heard claims that a consultant obstetrician, Dr Katherine Astbury, made the remark to Mrs Halappanavar and her husband Praveen, and also that the midwife said it. Dr Astbury, who was cross-examined over her treatment of Mrs Halappanavar for several hours today, denies using the phrase. But the consultant has admitted there were system failures in her care and she also warned of a lack of legal clarity for doctors treating pregnant women who suffer health risks. Mrs Halappanavar was 17 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to the hospital in pain. Asked by Mr Gleeson if it would have been. insensitive, uncivilised and wrong to use the word Catholic to the. patient, Dr Astbury said: 'It’s certainly not something I would say.' Dr Astbury revealed there is confusion over how her patient was cared for, including that she had been unaware of blood test abnormalities and that the patient’s vitals should have been checked more regularly after her foetal membrane ruptured. The senior medic was asked by coroner Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin if the two aspects of Mrs Halappanavar’s care could be seen as system failures and she replied 'yes'. Dr Astbury revealed that she initially refused a request from the Halappanavars to terminate the pregnancy two days after her admission to hospital as at that time there was no risk to her life. Praveen Halappanavar, pictured arriving at the inquest, collapsed and vomited after his wife's death. 'She was well,' said Dr Astbury under cross-examination. 'There was no risk to her life. If you need to give somebody medication to deliver and there’s a foetal heartbeat, my understanding is that legally you are considered to be terminating.' Dr Astbury spoke in a loud, clear voice as widower Praveen Halappanavar, who claims she made the Catholic remark, sat with his friend, a Galway-based consultant Dr CVR Prasad. She addressed the Irish Medical Council guidelines on abortion which refer to terminating a pregnancy if there is a risk to the mother’s life. She said her understanding was that they relate to conditions such as cancer, such as women getting radiotherapy, cervical care or a hysterectomy. 'My understanding is that this is a case where a woman is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, usually unrelated to the pregnancy,' she said. Dr MacLoughlin asked if there was confusion over the interpretation of the guidelines. 'There’s no law to tell you what you what is permitted or not permitted,' she replied. Dr Astbury admitted there were system failures in her care at Galway University Hospital (pictured) Savita Halappanavar and Praveen Halappanavar at an event for the Indian community in Galway. Dr Astbury insisted that when she told. Mrs Halappanavar she could not abort the baby on the Tuesday, she used. the words: 'In this country it is not legal to terminate a pregnancy on. grounds of poor prognosis of the foetus.' The. doctor agreed that in other jurisdictions Mrs Halappanavar would have. been offered the option of a termination if the prognosis of her foetus. was poor. 'The law in Ireland does not permit termination even if there’s no prospect of viability,' she said. Dr Astbury saw Mrs Halappanavar at. 8.30am on the Wednesday during her morning round, about two hours after a. junior colleague raised concerns over her vitals and condition and. suspected sepsis chorioamnionitis, an infection of the foetal membrane. She. said the patient’s temperature and pulse rate had fallen in that time. and that she had not been told of an earlier entry on the medical notes. highlighting a sign of chorioamnionitis. Dr. Astbury said that had she known this she would then have started the. steps for a termination, instead of ordering tests to check for a urine. infection. 'A medical termination usually takes several hours, but I would have started it,' she said. Highlights:","output":"1. A midwife named Ann Maria Burke said sorry for telling an Indian woman, Savita Halappanavar, that she could not end her pregnancy because it was a \\"Catholic thing\\" in Ireland. 2. Savita Halappanavar later passed away due to an infection called septicemia after her miscarriage. 3.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the song that is considered Lennon's best known solo work?, using the article: Lennon played a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon that he could have a harmonica if he came to Edinburgh the following day; the harmonica had been stored in the Edinburgh bus depot after a passenger had inadvertently left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play the harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.As his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J-160E, and, from the start of his solo career, the Gibson Les Paul Junior. Double Fantasy producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings. Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the Fender Bass VI, providing bass on some Beatles numbers (\\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\") that occupied McCartney with another instrument. His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including \\"Imagine\\", described as his best-known solo work.

Step 1: Identify the basis of the movie. The text states that the movie is based on a 1980 novel of the same name by A.J. Quinnell. This indicates that the film has a literary source. Step 2: Consider the mentioned genre. The movie is described as a \\"crime thriller,\\" which suggests a fictional narrative rather than a factual account. Step 3: Analyze the plot and characters. The plot involves a former Special Activities Division operative/U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance officer-turned bodyguard seeking revenge after a nine-year-old girl is abducted. Although it's not impossible for such events to occur in real life, the plot and characters seem more like the product of a fictional narrative than a true story.

To find the missing angle of a triangle using the cosine rule, you need to know the length of all three sides of the triangle. For example, you might have triangle RST. Side SR is 8 cm long. Side ST is 10 cm long. Side RT is 12 cm long. What is the measurement of angle S? The formula is c2=a2+b2−2abcos⁡C{displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2abcos {C}}. In this formula, cos⁡C{displaystyle cos {C}} equals the cosine of the angle you are trying to find. The variable c{displaystyle c} equals the side opposite the missing angle. The variables a{displaystyle a} and b{displaystyle b} are the lengths of the other two sides. Plug these values into the formula. For example, since side RT is opposite the missing angle, angle S, side RT will equal c{displaystyle c} in the formula. The other two side lengths will be a{displaystyle a} and b{displaystyle b}. It doesn’t matter which side is which variable. So, your formula should look like this: 122=82+102−2(8)(10)cos⁡C{displaystyle 12^{2}=8^{2}+10^{2}-2(8)(10)cos {C}}. You are multiplying 2ab{displaystyle 2ab} times the cosine of the missing angle, which you don’t know yet. So, the variable should remain. For example, 122=82+102−160cos⁡C{displaystyle 12^{2}=8^{2}+10^{2}-160cos {C}}. Remember that to square a number, you multiply the number by itself. For example, 144=82+102−160cos⁡C{displaystyle 144=8^{2}+10^{2}-160cos {C}} Make sure you square each number first, and then add them together. For example:144=64+100−160cos⁡C{displaystyle 144=64+100-160cos {C}}144=164−160cos⁡C{displaystyle 144=164-160cos {C}} To do this, subtract the sum of a2{displaystyle a^{2}} and b2{displaystyle b^{2}} from both sides of the equation. Then, divide each side of the equation by the coefficient of the missing angle’s cosine. For example, to isolate the cosine of the missing angle, subtract 164 from both sides of the equation, then divide each side by -160:144−164=164−164−160cos⁡C{displaystyle 144-164=164-164-160cos {C}}−20=−160cos⁡C{displaystyle -20=-160cos {C}}−20−160=−160cos⁡C−160{displaystyle {frac {-20}{-160}}={frac {-160cos {C}}{-160}}}0.125=cos⁡C{displaystyle 0.125=cos {C}} This will give you the measurement of the missing angle. On a calculator, the inverse cosine key is denoted by COS−1{displaystyle COS^{-1}}. For example, the inverse cosine of .0125 is 82.8192. So, the missing angle, angle S, is 82.8192 degrees. Summary:","output":"Using the cosine rule formula, the missing angle (S) of a triangle with sides SR (8 cm), ST (10 cm), and RT (12 cm) can be found, resulting in an angle measurement of 82.8192 degrees."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have an equation like this: -11 * r + 39 = 6 * r - 114 Our goal is to find the value of \\"r.\\" So, we want to get \\"r\\" by itself on one side of the equation. First, we will add 11 * r to both sides of the equation. This cancels out the -11 * r on the left side: -11 * r + 11 * r + 39 = 6 * r + 11 * r - 114 Now the equation looks like: 39 = 17 * r - 114 Next, we will add 114 to both sides of the equation. This cancels out the -114 on the right side: 39 + 114 = 17 * r Now the equation looks like: 153 = 17 * r Lastly, we will divide both sides of the equation by 17. This will tell us the value of \\"r\\": 153 ÷ 17 = 17 * r ÷ 17 After dividing, we get: 9 = r So the value of \\"r\\" is 9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How much are the year's returns projected to cover for the income in interest?\\" is \\"It will cover 750,000 and 1 million\\"?  [+] no; [+] yes;","output":"Yes, according to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How much are the year's returns projected to cover for the income in interest?\\" is \\"It will cover between 700,000 and 1 million\\". The passage mentions that this year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of the 4.5 million in interest generated last year. Consequently, the anticipated coverage for the income in interest would be in that specified range."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Prostě budeme muset vyhrát.\\" Let me provide you with a detailed breakdown of this translation: 1. \\"All right\\" means \\"Dobře\\" in Czech language. \\"Dobře\\" is an adverb which can be used to express agreement, acceptance, or acknowledgment. It is a commonly used phrase in daily communication. 2. \\"We're just gonna have to win\\" can be translated to \\"Prostě budeme muset vyhrát.\\" In this phrase: - \\"We're\\" (a contraction of \\"we are\\") translates to \\"Budeme\\". \\"Budeme\\" is the future tense of the verb \\"být\\" (to be) for the first-person plural (we).    - \\"Just gonna\\" is an informal way of saying \\"going to\\" or \\"simply have to\\". In Czech, this can be translated as \\"Prostě\\". \\"Prostě\\" is an adverb used to emphasize that something must be done or will happen, indicating a sense of inevitability.    - \\"Have to\\" can be translated to \\"muset\\" in Czech, which is an auxiliary verb to express necessity or obligation. In the context of the phrase, it should be used in the infinitive form \\"muset\\".    - \\"Win\\" can be translated to \\"vyhrát\\" in Czech. \\"Vyhrát\\" is the infinitive form of the verb, which means to win or achieve victory in a competition, game, or battle. So, the complete translation \\"Dobře. Prostě budeme muset vyhrát.\\" carries the same meaning as the original English phrase \\"All right.

Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"While the suggested answer provides a brief connection between the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress and the earlier Declaration of Rights and Grievances, it lacks sufficient detail and context for a full understanding. Here is a more detailed and comprehensive answer to help in verifying the accuracy of the information provided: The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress, also known as the \\"Declaration of Colonial Rights,\\" were a set of resolutions adopted by the First Continental Congress on October 14, 1774, in response to British colonial policies that had led to increasing tensions between the American colonies and Great Britain. The First Continental Congress was a gathering of 56 delegates from 12 of the 13 British colonies in North America (only Georgia was not represented) that took place from September 5 to October 26, 1774, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Much like the Declaration of Rights and Grievances passed by the Stamp Act Congress a decade earlier in 1765, the Declaration and Resolves aimed to articulate the colonists' rights and grievances with respect to the British government. However, the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress was a more comprehensive and detailed document compared to the earlier declaration. The Declaration and Resolves consisted of four main elements: 1. A preamble that asserted the colonists' loyalty to the British Crown and their commitment to defending their rights as Englishmen. 2. A declaration of the colonists' rights, which included the rights to life, liberty, property, and self-government. This section also asserted that the British Parliament had no authority to legislate for the American colonies, as they were not represented in that body. 3. A list of grievances detailing the ways in which the colonists believed their rights had been violated by British policies, such as the Intolerable Acts (the Coercive Acts and the Quebec Act), the imposition of taxes and duties without colonial consent, and restrictions on colonial trade and manufacturing. 4. A series of resolutions that called for a coordinated response from the colonies, including a boycott of British goods and an agreement not to export American products to Britain until their grievances were addressed. In conclusion, it is partially accurate to say that the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress were similar to the Declaration of Rights and Grievances passed by the Stamp Act Congress a decade earlier, as both documents expressed colonial opposition to British policies and sought to assert the rights of the colonies. However, the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress went further in detailing specific grievances and providing resolutions for a unified colonial response. This more comprehensive document represents a significant evolution in the development of American colonial thought and resistance to British rule."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Demand is identified and then satisfied through a supply chain. Attempts are made to increase demand through advertising. In the 2000s, an increasing amount of retailing began occurring online using electronic payment and delivery via a courier or via postal mail. Retailing as a sector includes subordinated services, such as delivery. The term \\"retailer\\" is also applied where a service provider services the small orders of a large number of individuals, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shops may be on residential streets, streets with few or no houses, or in a shopping mall. Shopping streets may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to create a more comfortable shopping environment  protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or precipitation. Forms of non-shop retailing include online retailing (a type of electronic-commerce used for business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions) and mail order.  - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains.

In this question, the key terms are \\"chief organ\\" and \\"urinary system.\\" Step 2: Recall the basic function of the urinary system. The urinary system's main function is to filter waste products and excess substances from the blood, maintain electrolyte balance, and produce urine as a way to excrete these waste products from the body. Step 3: Evaluate the choices based on their roles in the urinary system. - Liver: The liver plays a role in detoxifying the body, but it is not part of the urinary system. Therefore, the liver is not the right answer. - Bladder: The bladder is part of the urinary system and functions as a temporary storage unit for urine. However, it does not filter waste products from the blood, so it isn't the chief organ. - Lung: The lung is not part of the urinary system. Its primary function is to facilitate gas exchange for respiration. Therefore, it's not the right answer. - Kidney: The kidneys are the primary organs responsible for filtering waste products and excess substances from the blood. They maintain electrolyte balance and produce urine, which is the main function of the urinary system. Step 4: Select the most appropriate option based on your analysis. As the kidneys execute the main function of the urinary system, they are the chief organ.

Following the war, Yugoslavia acquired the Italian territory of Istria as well as the cities of Zadar and Rijeka. Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate Trieste into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies. This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on US transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the west. From 1945 to 1948, at least four US aircraft were shot down.[better source needed] Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when US had operational nuclear weapons whereas USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the Greek Civil War, while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council.

King: Conservatives hit low by politicizing Paris attacks Last week, two college students in Missouri, Hunter Park and Connor Stottlemyre, were arrested for making death threats to black students and staff members at the University of Missouri. “I’m going to stand my ground tomorrow and shoot every black person I see,” read one sickening post. “Some of you are alright,” another ominous message stated. “Don’t go to campus tomorrow.” Yet another said, “Well tomorrow mizzou will really make national news.” Early reports are already revealing that Hunter Park expressed to police his “deep interest” in an earlier school shooting this year in Oregon. Paris is what the real enemies of diversity and freedom look like. It’s not your college presidents, students. THIS is hatred, oppression. Understandably, these threats, combined with the reality that students on campus have a long, documented history of facing racism, caused a sincere panic. The following day, the campus was a ghost town as students decided by the thousands to stay in their dorms or off campus housing. Over 319 days so far in 2015, the United States has had 325 mass shootings, so it’s not quite like students were imagining the possibility of a threat to their lives. Someone wanna tell the Mizzou students what happened in Paris? They could use a lesson in what real oppression and hatred is. Somehow, though, just minutes after the mass shootings in Paris, several popular conservatives decided to use the French tragedy, which was still an active hostage situation at the time, as a starting point to critique students at the University of Missouri. Steve Krakauer, a former producer for CNN and Glenn Beck, weighed in early on how Missouri students weren’t really facing real hatred and oppression, implying that ISIS, and not education officials, were the only true enemies of cultural diversity. \\"Paris is what the real enemies of diversity and freedom look like. It's not your college presidents, students,\\" Krakauer Tweeted Friday evening just minutes after the first first shots were fired. \\"THIS is hatred, oppression.\\" Four minutes later, as if they were reading from the same talking points, popular conservative conspiracy theorist Mark Dice waded in with the same sentiment. \\"Someone wanna tell the Mizzou students what happened in Paris?\\" wrote Dice. \\"They could use a lesson in what real oppression and hatred is.\\" What’s wild about how Steve Krakauer and Mark Dice handled this is that the shootings were still unfolding and a manhunt was still underway when they quickly began politicizing the terrorist attack for unrelated cultural commentary at home. Not only that, but the notion that students being called racial slurs to their faces and threatened to be shot on sight is not real hatred or oppression is about as outrageous and offensive as it gets. In essence their argument is either that oppression and hatred aren’t real unless you are killed or oppression and hatred aren’t real unless you are French. Obviously, both arguments are ignorant. Hunter Park and Connor Stottlemyre both fully intended to terrorize and induce panic among African Americans at the University of Missouri when they said what they said. When students on campus, including the student body president, have been called racial slurs on campus, if that wasn’t hatred, what was it? While it’s despicable that these conservatives are politicizing this tragedy, it’s equally sick that they are attempting to erase the very real pain and terror experienced by students in our own country. I’m not sure if Steve or Mark are parents, but I wonder if someone threatened to kill their children or if strangers called their kids horrific names to their faces, if they’d simply ignore it and move on. I doubt it.

Review: Election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by Johnnie To. To marvellously casted Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D, as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for Ho Sing society, a 100 year old trial society. While Lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times, Big D is not only impatient, but also thinks that he is on top of everything. Lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years. To have the total control of the gang, the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a Dragon Baton, which represents power and authority. Big D was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members. He ordered his man to get the Baton before it falls onto the hands of Lok. While Big D is getting the Baton, Lok has other plans for him. This is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed. Johnnie To puts the greed of the human beings in the movie, where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one. However, no single bullet is used, hardly any gangfights are involved in Election. It's the battle of the wits that makes Election stands out of the rest.

The reason for this is that both the sandpaper and the gravel have rough surfaces with many small irregularities. When these irregularities are in contact with each other, they experience a higher resistance to motion due to the increased number of contact points between the surfaces. On the other hand, the glass table has a relatively smooth surface.

Pacific War: U.S. submarines, as well as some British and Dutch vessels, operating from bases at Cavite in the Philippines (1941–42); Fremantle and Brisbane, Australia; Pearl Harbor; Trincomalee, Ceylon; Midway; and later Guam, played a major role in defeating Japan, even though submarines made up a small proportion of the Allied navies—less than two percent in the case of the US Navy. Submarines strangled Japan by sinking its merchant fleet, intercepting many troop transports, and cutting off nearly all the oil imports essential to weapons production and military operations.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Amphibians have permeable skin that easily absorbs substances from the environment. This may explain why they seem to be especially sensitive to pollution. Monitoring the health and survival of amphibians may help people detect pollution early, before other organisms are affected.   Choices:  - fish  - mammals  - reptiles  - amphibians   A: The answer is:","output":"amphibians. The paragraph clearly states that amphibians have permeable skin that easily absorbs substances from the environment, making them particularly sensitive to pollution. This unique characteristic of their skin allows substances, including pollutants, to pass through it more easily than other groups of animals. As a result, amphibians serve as valuable bioindicators for environmental health, meaning that monitoring their well-being can help detect pollution early on before it impacts other organisms. In comparison, fish, mammals, and reptiles do not possess the same degree of permeability in their skin, which makes them less vulnerable to pollution than amphibians. Fish typically have scales that offer some protection against chemicals in the water, while mammals and reptiles have less permeable skin, which limits the absorption of environmental substances. Consequently, they do not serve as effective bioindicators for pollution as amphibians do. Amphibians, which include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts, play a crucial role in helping humans understand the health of ecosystems. They occupy various habitats, such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, and even urban settings, and they form an important part of the food chain, being prey and predators to several species. As a consequence, their sensitivity to pollution can signal potential threats to biodiversity, ecosystem balance, and human health, making it essential for researchers and policy-makers to focus on preserving their populations and habitats. In conclusion, the answer to the question is amphibians. Their permeable skin makes them uniquely vulnerable to pollution, enabling them to serve as early warning systems for environmental contamination. By monitoring their health and survival, humans can better understand the state of ecosystems and work towards preserving our shared environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Watford have signed Rennes midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure for an undisclosed fee and immediately sent him to La Liga side Granada on loan. Article:","output":"Title: Watford Secure Signing of Rennes Midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure and Loan Him to Granada English Premier League side Watford FC have announced the signing of Rennes midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure for an undisclosed fee. Doucoure will not be joining the Hornets' squad immediately, as he has been loaned out to Spanish La Liga team Granada for the remainder of the season. Step 1: Research on Doucoure's background and career highlights The 27-year-old French midfielder started his professional career at Rennes in 2012 and has been instrumental in their midfield ever since. He has made over 100 appearances for the Ligue 1 side, contributing goals and assists throughout his tenure at the club. Step 2: Analyze the impact of the signing on Watford Doucoure's signing is a significant acquisition for Watford, highlighting their ambition to strengthen the squad and compete at the highest level in the English Premier League. The midfielder's strengths include his ability to control the pace of the game, accurate passing, and defensive awareness, which will undoubtedly benefit the team once he is integrated into the squad. Step 3: Discuss why Watford is loaning Doucoure to Granada The decision to loan Doucoure to Granada, which is part of Watford's affiliated clubs, appears to be a strategic move. This will allow the player to familiarize himself with the club's playing style and demonstrate his ability to adapt to new environments before ultimately joining Watford in the future. Step 4: Evaluate Granada's need for Doucoure and the benefits of the loan to both teams Granada, currently fighting for a stable position in La Liga, will undoubtedly benefit from Doucoure's presence, as he brings experience and skill to the midfield. Conversely, this loan spell will provide Doucoure the opportunity to gain valuable experience playing competitive football in one of Europe's top leagues, preparing him for his eventual arrival at Watford and his journey in the Premier League. Step 5: Predict Doucoure's future at Watford As the undisclosed fee indicates a considerable investment by Watford, the club will certainly have high expectations for Doucoure. His performances at Granada will likely be closely monitored, and both the fans and the management will be optimistic about the contributions he can make once he rejoins the team. In conclusion, Rennes midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure's signing by Watford and his subsequent loan to Granada seem to present mutual benefits for both clubs, as well as the player. While Doucoure will not be playing in the English Premier League immediately, his time in La Liga will be a valuable learning experience, preparing him to make an impact for Watford upon his return."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals) and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. After signing to EMI in 1991, Radiohead released their debut single \\"Creep\\" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and one of the best albums in popular music. Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), recorded simultaneously, marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from experimental electronic music, 20th-century classical music, krautrock, and jazz. Kid A divided listeners but was named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and The Times. Hail to the Thief (2003) mixed rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have pioneered alternative release platforms such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent; Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling.

Finding himself outside the meeting house where a revival is going, he goes in and undergoes a religious awakening and vows never to get angry at anyone ever again.

Given the question: This article: As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \\"aesthetically pleasing\\", they lack \\"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \\"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \\"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.

The answer is:","output":"The spatial device that Francis Bacon continued to incorporate and used many times throughout his career is the three lines radiating from the central figure. This device can be first seen in his painting Crucifixion, 1933, and was employed by Bacon as a means of creating a sense of space, movement, and tension in his work. The radiating lines help to draw the viewer's attention towards the central figure, while also establishing a dynamic connection between the figure and its surrounding environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What does Mr. Lomax's reanimated corpse need to hear in order to move? from the following article ?  Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd St-Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox. The answer to this question is:","output":"Mr. Lomax's reanimated corpse needs to hear music in order to move. The voodoo ceremony performed by Henry and Charles used a pigeon instead of the intended sacrificial chicken, and this limitation caused Bernie's mobility to be dependent on hearing music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The word \\"slut\\" is a sexual slur used almost exclusively against women. It's a way to say that a girl or woman is a bad person because she has too much sex or too many sexual partners. Sometimes it is used in a bantering way between friends, and other times it is used to bully or put a woman down.  Sometimes girls and women call each other \\"sluts\\" as a way to take back that word from its negative use, in an effort to make light of it and drain it of some of its power. It's a way for girls to take the shame out of enjoying their sexuality. There are many oppressed groups that have \\"reclaimed\\" words once used against them in this way. If you have friends who call you a slut, think about their intent: they may mean it in an endearing way. You can ask them to stop if it bothers you, and since they are your friends, they should understand and do their best to stop. If someone is using the word \\"slut\\" against you in a way that makes you feel belittled, hurt, or harassed, it doesn't matter what her intention is. She is bullying you. Although the term slut is usually associated with someone who has a lot of sex, or who expresses her sexuality in ways that other people don't approve of, in reality it is often used in other ways by girls themselves.  One study of college women found that the word had very little to do with the target's sexual behaviors. Instead, in the study, higher social class women used the term against lower social class women as a way of saying that they didn't want to include them in their social group.  That study found that white, middle-to upper-class college women used the word \\"slut\\" against poorer women and women of color most often, and that the bullies themselves often had more sexual experience than the targets. This might seem silly, especially if you're not a little kid and you think bullying belongs in elementary school. Actually, people of all ages can experience bullying, which really just means that a person is mean to another person over and over again. Calling names like \\"slut\\" is a very common form of girl-on-girl bullying. They may be calling you a slut because gossip has spread about your relationships or sexuality (possibly started by someone who wants to increase his own reputation as a \\"stud\\"), but this word and others like it (such as \\"whore,\\" \\"hoe,\\" or \\"skank\\") may simply be your bullies' way of humiliating you with little or nothing to do with your sexual behavior. Technology makes bullying easier than ever, so if you are active on social networking sites, you may need to take some precautions to keep bullies from having access to your information.  Lock down your privacy settings and ensure that your only friends on social media are people you know and trust in real life. If you are friends with your bully, unfriend her; you might also consider unfriending mutual friends, or at the very least limiting what they can see on your profile. Never post anything — text or photos — that you wouldn't want circulated among your family, friends, workplace, or school. Report any bullying or threatening messages you receive to your parents, teachers, and even the police if the messages happen frequently or contain any threats. You might be tempted to return like-for-like when it comes to bullying behavior, but fighting with your bully by calling her names, spreading rumors about her, or getting into physical fights will not help your situation. In fact, it might result in you getting into trouble, when she's the one who started the whole thing.  If you have one bully, consider approaching her and asking her to stop. Be the bigger person. This can be incredibly hard in the moment, but give your bully a sincere smile, and say something like, \\"I'm not sure why you said that, but I really want you to stop.\\" Then walk away. Sometimes a bully can be so taken back by a genuine response that she won't know what to do.  If you think your bully is an otherwise reasonable person, ask her if she wants to talk. You might say, \\"Is there something I did that made you angry at me? Would you like to have lunch and talk about it?\\" Sitting down and having a conversation can help get at the root of her behavior, if she's willing. She may have heard a rumor about you or may have some other explanation for why she is targeting you.  Even if she doesn't want to sit down and talk, knowing that you're a reasonable person who is open to discussion might make her less upset with you and less likely to target you. Think about the relationship as a balloon that is not fully filled with air. If you don't put any air into the balloon, it will continue to not have substance to it. If you do put air into the balloon, it will get bigger and bigger. Engaging a bully is a lot like this. If you refuse to feed into the bullying dynamic, you refuse to put air into the balloon. Eventually, the bully will pick on someone else in order to \\"inflate her balloon.\\" Girl bullies often travel in groups, working together to pick on other girls to make themselves feel more powerful. It is not usually helpful to confront a group of several girls at once all by yourself.  Avoid the situation as much as possible. Try to avoid running into your bullies if possible, and ask a friend to go with you if you have to go somewhere you know the clique will be.  Don't react. Remember what your parents told you as a child, about how reacting to a bully is just giving them what they want? It turns out your parents were right. Bullies thrive on power, so if you don't respond by getting angry or crying, you'll drain the experience of fun for the bullies and they will hopefully move on. Try to stay calm and focus on something else if it happens again. If you are feeling targeted by girls at school or women at work, you don't have to suffer in silence. Talking about it can help you figure out strategies to overcome it.  Talk to your parents or other trusted adult. Explain the situation and ask them to help you figure out a solution. Sometimes having a parent intervene is the only way to get it to stop. Your parent might contact the bully's parents, the principal, or help you come up with strategies to use in the moment if it happens again. Parents should familiarize themselves with the school's harassment policy. Talk to a counselor or therapist to help you separate the criticisms other people might throw at you from your actual value as a human being. Talk to a teacher, school counselor, or supervisor if you are being bullied or harassed at school or work. That behavior is illegal in a workplace and almost always against the code of conduct in a school or university setting, and should be dealt with at an administrative level to be sure it doesn't keep happening.

Feminists should end their distrust of science Scientists at the universities of Exeter and York have revealed new details about the menopause in killer whales. Studying orcas in the wild has shown that females live unusually far beyond their fertile years because of the benefits their accumulated knowledge bring to the group, as well as the lifelong support they give their sons. Related: The Guardian view on granny orcas: nothing to do with humans | Editorial Evolutionary researchers have been quick to draw comparisons between orcas and humans. Could early human societies also have evolved to rely on the invaluable wisdom and help of female elders? These comparisons, though, have been a little too quick for some. A Guardian leader column, for example, concluded that scientific conundrums like these are “irrelevant” to feminist theory. Human values have nothing to do with what science tells us about how we evolved. And whale research tells us only about whales. Feminism and science have long had an uneasy relationship. That’s hardly surprising. Charles Darwin expressed as scientific theory his opinion that women are the less evolved sex, and other Victorian biologists claimed women could never catch up to men in the evolutionary race to higher intelligence and creativity. Likewise, through the 20th century, male scientists suggested that women had tiny sex drives, that the orgasm was an evolutionary vestige of male anatomy, and that women had smaller brains corresponding to smaller intellects. Scientists have often looked at women as the inferior sex (some still do), threatening the cause of women’s rights with biological determinism. So it makes sense that feminists have returned their gaze with suspicion. The problem is that dismissing science as a body of knowledge means ignoring the best means we have of understanding ourselves. Like all sets of ideas, we need to see science for what it is: an imperfect but promising road to the facts. Correcting itself along the way – and there’s no doubt that corrections are needed – it explains our bodies, minds and place in the universe. Far from irrelevant, then, science should be a useful resource for feminists. When we are told that women are natural homemakers, it can tell us what “natural” really means. When people claim women are intellectually less able, science can expose this as nonsense. The more research, the more we learn just how much the gaps we see are rooted in society and culture, not in biology. Scientists have often looked at women as inferior, threatening the cause of women’s rights with biological determinism Evolutionary biology offers us the long view. Animal data is important because humans didn’t evolve independently. We share common ancestors with other species. When the menopause – practically unknown among other species – happens to orcas as well as to us, we must pay attention. They provide clues that may help explain how we adapted to our ancient environments. They are part of our history. Very distant history, maybe, but history nonetheless. Being as far removed as we are now from how our earliest ancestors lived, we may assume our evolutionary story doesn’t matter. The societies we’ve constructed, which bear testament to humankind’s mastery over nature, have nothing to do with hunting, gathering, or cavewomen crouched over fires. But the story does have the power to answer that dark, niggling question that is still asked: is the sexual inequality we see today rooted in something biological? Is it an essential difference, dating back to the dawn of human life? The old ideas of Darwin’s time are already giving way to more accurate accounts of our evolutionary history. The menopause represents one of the most exciting areas of research about women. Here, we see cruel notions about older women being useless to society, or sexually unwanted, are being superseded by compelling new theories. According to anthropologist Kristen Hawkes at the University of Utah, who has done the most work on this, women evolved to survive so far past menopausal age because, in our past, they were crucial to our survival – much like female orcas. The evidence so far backs her up. Science can help rewrite the story of woman. This is where the final frontier of feminism really lies. As Hawkes says: “If you’re really paying attention to biology, how can you not be a feminist?” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text discuss: 1. The new study on menopause in killer whales (orcas), suggesting that evolutionary researchers draw comparisons between orcas and humans, particularly regarding the wisdom and help of female elders in both species. 2. The uneasy relationship between feminism and science due to historical biases and unscientific claims suggesting women's inferiority. 3. The assertion that feminists should not dismiss science as a whole but utilize it as a resource for understanding human biology and debunking myths about women's natural capabilities. 4.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

Information:  - Madchester is a broad genre label popularized by the British music press in the early 1990s, referring to the music scene that developed in the Manchester area towards the late 1980s and into the early 1990s. The music that emerged from the scene mixed alternative rock, psychedelic rock and electronic dance music. Artists associated with the scene included the Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, the Inspiral Carpets, Northside, 808 State, James and The Charlatans, amongst others. At that time, the Haçienda nightclub, co-owned by members of New Order, was a major catalyst for the distinctive musical ethos in the city that was called the Second Summer of Love. The scene is widely seen as heavily influenced by drugs, especially ecstasy (MDMA).  - The Second Summer of Love is a name given to the period in 198889 in Britain, during the rise of acid house music and the euphoric explosion of unlicensed MDMA-fuelled rave parties. The term generally refers to the summers of both 1988 and 1989 when electronic dance music and the prevalence of the drug MDMA fuelled an explosion in youth culture culminating in mass free parties and the era of the rave. LSD was also widely available and popular again. The music of this era fused dance beats with a psychedelic, 1960s flavour, and the dance culture drew parallels with the hedonism and freedom of the Summer of Love in San Francisco two decades earlier. Similarities with the Sixties included fashions such as Tie-dye. The smiley logo is synonymous with this period in the UK.  - 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy (E), is a psychoactive drug used primarily as a recreational drug. Desired effects include increased empathy, euphoria, and heightened sensations. When taken by mouth, effects begin after 3045 minutes and last 36 hours. It is also sometimes snorted or smoked. , MDMA has no accepted medical uses. Adverse effects of MDMA use include addiction, memory problems, paranoia, difficulty sleeping, teeth grinding, blurred vision, sweating, and a rapid heartbeat. Use may also lead to depression and fatigue. Deaths have been reported due to increased body temperature and dehydration. MDMA increases the release and slows the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in parts of the brain. It has stimulant and psychedelic effects. The initial increase is followed by a short-term decrease in the neurotransmitters. MDMA belongs to the substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine and substituted amphetamine classes of drugs. MDMA was first made in 1912. It was used to improve psychotherapy beginning in the 1970s and became popular as a street drug in the 1980s. MDMA is commonly associated with dance parties, raves, and electronic dance music. It is often sold mixed with other substances such as ephedrine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. In 2014, between 9 and 29 million people between the ages of 15 and 64 used ecstasy (0.2% to 0.6% of the world population). This was broadly similar to the percentage of people who use cocaine, amphetamines, and opioids, but fewer than for cannabis. In the United States, about 0.9 million people used ecstasy in 2010. MDMA is generally illegal in most countries. Limited exceptions are sometimes made for research. Researchers are investigating whether a few low doses of MDMA may assist in treating severe, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In November 2016, phase 3 clinical trials for PTSD were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to assess effectiveness...  - Shaun William George Ryder (born 23 August 1962) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, actor, television personality, author, and newspaper columnist.

The expensive fashion design houses such as Channel, Yves Saint Laurent, and Christian Dior, which earned money by designing and making very expensive custom clothes, had lost many of their wealthy customers. To stay in business, they started selling more reasonably priced ready-to-wear clothing along with a wide range of accessories , that is, related products such as shoes, bags, watches. All of these products needed to blend  with the clothing and with each other so that they made up a brand that everyone would recognize and wanted to buy. Though they did not use that name, each company needed a \\"master designer.\\" Born in Texas and growing up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Ford had a diverse background in the arts. Soon after completing high school, he moved to New York, where he studied art history, trained as an actor, and worked as a model. Following that, Ford completed a program in indoor design, but later decided that he was more interested in designing clothes than in decorating house. He was hired by the firm Cathy Hardwick in 1986, where he began to work as a fashion designer. His talent stood out from the rest and soon he moved to Perry Ellis, where he became design director. Then in 1990 he made an important move by taking a position with the New York branch of Gucci, the famous design house based in Milan, Italy. During his first years at Gucci, the company was going through a very difficult period. Its products were once considered highly desirable, and were worn by famous women such as Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, and Jacqueline Kennedy. However, by the early 1990s they had lost their reputation for quality. Other producers had started making cheap, widely available imitations of the brand, and the sales of Gucci's own products had dropped. Things were so bad at one point that Ford was almost fired. However, some people at the company believed in his talent, and in 1994 they hired him to work in Milan as the creative... Question: Why did the author most likely write this passage?

Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA. HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville. But the garden serves an even greater purpose. The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood. \\"It's a reawakening going on. It's almost like it's a renaissance,\\" says Cashawn Myers, director of HABESHA Inc. \\"There's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa. Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward.

Giant Octopus Movie plot: Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a sharkâs tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao), a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeilâs submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus. MacNeil reflects on the polar ice caps melting due to man-made global warming, and wonders if the creatures are mankindâs âcomeuppanceâ. Meanwhile, a U.S. \\"naval destroyer\\"... The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie \\"Mega Shark Vs. Giant Octopus,\\" Lorenzo Lamas plays the character Allan Baxter. He is a government agent who seeks to hinder the efforts of the oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) and her team as they try to stop the mega shark and giant octopus from wreaking havoc. Baxter is highly skeptical of MacNeil’s theories and methods, and his character consistently acts as an obstacle to their success throughout the film. This clashes with the team's goal to stop the prehistoric creatures, causing tension and conflict among the characters. The character Allan Baxter is adversarial but, at the same time, he indirectly contributes to the development of the plot and the intensity of the story's climax."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Istanbul, the city that bridges Europe and Asia, is a vibrant metropolis with a rich history, including over 800 years as the capital of Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire and Latin Empire. Istanbul has a strong tradition of bazaars and bustling marketplaces that have been trading hubs within the city for centuries. The city is home to numerous famous bazaars, the most notable of which is the Grand Bazaar.  The Grand Bazaar, or Kapalıçarşı, is one of the world's oldest and largest covered markets spanning over 60 streets and hosting over 4,000 shops. Established in 1461, this iconic marketplace has been attracting traders and merchants from around the globe for centuries. Visitors can find an array of authentic Turkish goods such as handwoven carpets, intricate jewelry, spices, ceramics, and textiles, amongst many other treasures. The atmosphere within the bazaar is an experience in itself, with shopkeepers and customers haggling over prices, and the scents of spices and Turkish tea filling the air. Besides the Grand Bazaar, Istanbul boasts a variety of other noteworthy bazaars, such as the Egyptian Bazaar (Spice Bazaar), the Fatih Market, and the nearby Arasta Bazaar. Each of these markets offers a unique shopping experience and a glimpse into traditional Turkish commerce.  Although other options like China (Option A), Arabia (Option D), and India (Option E) also have notable bazaars and markets, the option of attending a bazaar does not directly correspond to an entire nation or geographical region.

Help as much as you can. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: About 97% of the world's water is salty and is found in our oceans and seas. But, as we can't drink seawater, how can it be important? Every part of our seas and oceans contains an amazing number of animals and fish that live at different ocean depths. Most of the different species of animals and fish depend on simple plants for their food. These simple plants called algae   drift near the surface of the ocean and use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen. In fact, algae produce over half of the oxygen people breathe. How important seawater is! Each plant or animal in our seas and oceans is an important link in a food chain. The algae are eaten in large amounts by microscopic animals, which are in turn consumed by larger animals. These food chains are delicately balanced. The bad news about the food chains in the oceans is that they are under threat because of man. People once thought that the oceans were so big that it didn't matter if we dumped rubbish into them or caught huge quantities of fish and whales for food. But we now know this is not true and fish stocks in the oceans have started to drop. Thankfully, the world is taking steps to protect the future of our oceans by introducing international agreements to protect marine habitats. Most countries have introduced fishing restrictions to protect fish stocks in the oceans and new techniques are being pioneered to cope with pollution. Finally, the importance of protecting oceans is being made known to more people. This is just the beginning of a long process to protect the oceans for our future. We depend on the oceans for fish which are an important part of the human diet. How important seawater is! Question: From the passage, we learn that   _  .

Serial sets stage for podcast advertising boom You could almost guarantee that Serial, the popular true crime podcast, would be mentioned early and often at an event focused on podcasts. So it went Thursday at the at the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s first ever Podcast Upfront, an advertising extravaganza for the emerging podcast industry. Serial is largely responsible for a recent wave of interest in digital audio storytelling. With more than 100 million downloads, it is one of the biggest and most impactful things to happen to its cottage industry. As Mark McCrery, CEO of Podtrac, the company that sells ads for Serial, said on stage, “Serial has reset the bar for how big podcasting can be.” With the bar reset, podcasting is moving into the big time. Or trying to, at least. Depending on whom you ask the 17 billion spent annually on radio advertising is up for grabs. On the music side, Pandora, Spotify and other streaming services are eating up billions in ad spending. And now, on the talk side, we have podcasting, which is admittedly measly. One report published before the Serial phenomenon predicted just 34 million in spending on podcast ads in 2016. The Podcast Upfronts featured many of the buzzwords used any advertising event: engaged audience, thought leaders, brand message, and 360 degree brand experience. But beyond that, it was not like other Upfront events. TV networks have thrown Upfront schmooze-fests since 1948 with the goal of dazzling advertisers with stars, booze, and a new slate of TV shows. Recently, digital media outlets joined in by throwing their own “Newfront” parties, even though it makes no logistical sense to sell digital ads a year in advance. Like podcasting itself, the Podcast Upfront was far more modest than the glitzy Midtown affairs thrown by TV networks. For one, playing an audio clip for an audience doesn’t quite have the same “wow” factor as a slick sizzle reel. Neither the audience nor the presenter knows where to look. And two, even though podcasting has attracted and created many stars, from radio personality Ira Glass and comedian Marc Maron to actor Alec Baldwin and reality show star Snooki, they weren’t there rubbing elbows with the ad execs. A small room filled with around 75 executives watched as representatives from companies like Podtrac, Midroll, and AdLarge bragged about the benefits of advertising on their shows. The average podcast listener has likely never heard of these companies, even though they represent some of the most popular podcasts. Podtrac sells ads for Serial and This American Life, the podcast version of the popular NPR radio show. Midroll sells ads for WTF with Marc Maron and Startalk with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. AdLarge sells ads for the AP’s podcasts. Panoply sells ads for Slate’s podcasts. They made a compelling case: Podcast listeners are loyal and passionate. They’re highly educated and have disposable income. McCrery argued they’re more effective than video and display ads, which may be true because most of the ad formats aren’t 30-second radio ads. Rather, they’re endorsements read by the podcast’s hosts, making them inherently more compelling and valuable. At one point, Farnoosh Torabi, the host of a popular personal finance podcast called So Money, concluded, as if it had just occurred to her, “Plain and simple, advertisers should get on board.” Her interviewer, AdLarge CEO Cathy Csukas, followed it up with a hard sell. “It’s an exciting time and important to get in now before it gets even more crowded,” she warned. But podcasters won’t take any ad they can get. In a potentially awkward moment, Leo Laporte, a podcasting pioneer who runs TWiT.tv, a network of technology-focused video and podcast shows, said he he turns down a lot of advertisers that want spots on his show. “Sorry guys,” he said after the audience emitted an audible grimace. Anyone who advertises on his show “has to be someone I consider worthy of our audience,” he explained. “These are hardcore endorsement deals.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Serial, a popular true crime podcast, is one of the biggest and most impactful things to happen to digital audio storytelling with over 100 million downloads. This has led to a wave of interest in podcast advertising and the potential for ad spending in this format. The podcast industry is looking to move into competing with radio advertising, streaming services, and other digital ad platforms. Podcast listeners are seen as loyal, passionate, highly-educated, and possessing disposable income, making them an attractive audience for advertisers. Ad formats in podcasts often come in the form of endorsements read by the podcast's hosts, which can be more compelling and valuable than traditional 30-second radio ads."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: Pirates of Silicon Valley Movie plot: Steve Jobs (Noah Wyle) is speaking with director Ridley Scott (J. G.

Jobs is trying to convey his idea that \\"We're creating a completely new consciousness.\\" Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the commercial. Next in 1997 with Jobs, returning to Apple, and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the 1997 Macworld Expo. His partner, Steve Wozniak or \\"WOZ\\" (Joey Slotnick), is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \\"got from there to here,\\" the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple. The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the U.C. Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti-war movements. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \\"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\\" Wozniak then comments that \\"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he'd see karma or the meaning of the universe. Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University, in the early 1970s, with classmate Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio), and Gatesâ high school friend Paul Allen (Josh Hopkins). As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates' story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts's MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the acronym for the the name of the strike committee?, using the article: On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.Next day, a delegation of KOR intelligentsia, including Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A bibuła news-sheet, Solidarność, produced on the shipyard's printing press with KOR assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, Jacek Kaczmarski's protest song, Mury (Walls), gained popularity with the workers.On August 18, the Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

Summarize this article: The back of your toilet seat is usually connected to the toilet with two long screws that run through the porcelain at the back of the bowl. The screws are secured by two nuts underneath. In the front of the cover, look for a small groove that is designed to help you pry up the cover. Then, use a small screwdriver to pry up both the seat and the cover. In cheap toilets, the screws are made of plastic. Most toilets, however, use steel screws, and more expensive models may even use brass or stainless steel. Be especially careful with plastic screws! If the seat is loose, then it may wobble back and forth, in and out of alignment with the rim of the toilet bowl. Straighten out the seat so that it rests evenly atop the bowl. Consider sitting down to test it out for comfort. Turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten. Remember: \\"righty tighty, lefty loosey.\\" There's usually a nut with a wing attached to prevent the nut from turning. If there isn't,  hold the nut with a rag while you tighten the bolt. Decide which screwdriver is the best fit. Make sure that the screwdriver head is big enough to fit into the notches of the bolt head. If the screwdriver is too small, then the bolt will not turn. The friction from the slipping screwdriver will quickly wear down the bolt and make it unusable. If the bolt keeps turning without tightening up, clamp the nut underneath with a small pair of pliers. Clamp onto the end of the nut, and hold it steady as you screw the bolt. Once you have twisted the bolt several times, the wing on the nut should prevent it from turning anymore. To loosen the nut, spray it with WD 40 and wait 5 minutes. When the bolt feels tight, give it one more quarter rotation so it's extra secure. Once the seat does not wobble back and forth, push down the lid. It should click closed.","output":"This article explains the process of securing a loose toilet seat.

You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

UPDATED:. 11:47 EST, 11 June 2012. Prince Charles is the people's choice to succeed the Queen and take over the throne as King, a poll has revealed. Before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, William was the country's preferred choice to be the next king. But in a dramatic shift of mood, Charles is now considered to be the best person to take over the throne. Popular: Prince Charles is the people's choice to succeed the Queen and take over the throne as King, a poll has revealed. He is pictured paying a moving tribute to 'Mummy' after Monday's Diamond Jubilee concert. Turnaround: A fortnight ago, Prince William was the favoured successor to the Queen. But since the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Prince Charles is now the most popular choice. This could be because of his witty speech in praise of the Queen. The boost in Prince Charles' popularity may have been helped by his witty and emotional speech in praise of his mother at the close of the Diamond Jubilee Concert last Monday. His opening word – ‘Mummy’ – earned him rapturous cheers from the crowd as the Queen looked on delighted. As he drew to a close, he led the audience in giving three cheers for the Queen, before kissing her hand affectionately and adding: ‘So Your Majesty we offer you our humble duty and with it three resounding cheers for our Majesty The Queen!’ Next generation: Just a fortnight ago, 44 per cent of people said they preferred Prince William to be the next king. Another reason could be the way in which he stood in for his father, Prince Philip, who was hospitalised with a bladder infection which caused him to miss a large part of the Jubilee celebrations. The figures a fortnight ago revealed that 44 per cent of people preferred William to be the next king. This was compared with 38 per cent who preferred Charles. But since the successful Jubilee celebrations the figures have exactly reversed, according to a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times. The last time Charles was favoured to be the successor to the Queen was in 2005. Previously, he has struggled to shake off the perception among some members of the public that he is stuffy and pompous. But this has gradually altered over the years, thanks largely to his ideas for reform. He is believed to have been talking privately to aides for a number of years about a stripped-down monarchy - something which was demonstrated last week when the core members of the Royal family appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on the final day of the Jubilee celebrations. The Queen appeared with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Just Prince Philip was missing as he was being treated in hospital for his illness. The poll also revealed that William remains as popular as the Queen with 86 per cent of people considering them to be an asset to the royal family. Prince Philip yesterday celebrated his 91st birthday quietly with his family after spending five nights in hospital. He was discharged from the King Edward VII Hospital in central London on Saturday after being treated for a bladder infection. When asked if he was feeling better, the Duke of Edinburgh replied: ‘I wouldn’t be coming out otherwise.’ Buckingham Palace said he would ‘continue his convalescence’ at home but could not confirm if he would accompany the Queen to a garden party at Sandringham tomorrow. The Duchess of Cambridge polled 81 per cent with Prince Harry slightly behind - but still popular- on 75 per cent. Reflecting the astonishing success of the Jubilee celebrations, 33 per cent of people said they feel more proud to be British following last weekend's events. A total of 29 per cent also said they felt more positive towards the royal family since the Jubilee celebrations. During Charles' popular speech last Monday, he paid tribute to ‘the life and service of a very special person’. He told the Queen: ‘A Diamond Jubilee. is a unique and special event, some of us have had the joy of. celebrating three jubilees with you, and I have the medals to prove it. ‘And we're now celebrating the life and service of a very special person, over the last 60 years. ‘I. was three when my grandfather George VI died and suddenly,. unexpectedly, you and my father's lives were irrevocably changed when. you were only 26. ‘So as a nation this is our opportunity to thank you and my father for always being there for us. ‘For inspiring us with your selfless duty and service and for making us proud to be British.’ Stripped back: Prince Charles is believed to be in favour of a slimmed-down monarchy. Just the core members of the royal family appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on the final day of the Jubilee celebrations. Success: Since the Jubilee celebrations, 33 per cent of people said they feel more proud to be British. Supportive: A total of 29 per cent of people also said they felt more positive towards the royal family since the Jubilee celebrations.

Whether in personal or professional scenarios, social interactions play a crucial role in one's mental and emotional well-being. Building on this foundation, it becomes an individual's responsibility to contribute to a pleasant environment for social interaction. This article provides guidelines to act positively, be supportive, avoid awkwardness, and make everyone feel comfortable during social encounters, ultimately fostering healthy communication. 1. Act Positively Adopting a positive attitude is the first step in setting the tone for meaningful social interactions. Approach every conversation with enthusiasm and genuine interest in the other person. Listen attentively and respond thoughtfully to promote open and active engagement. Staying optimistic not only encourages healthy communication but also elevates the mood of individuals participating in the conversation. 2. Be Supportive Being a supportive friend or colleague involves offering encouragement, understanding, and empathy. Validate people's feelings and acknowledge their opinions even if you might not agree with them. Supporting others does not mean blindly agreeing with them but rather being present, showing respect, and understanding the context of their experiences. 3. Avoid Awkward Situations Nobody enjoys uncomfortable moments during social interactions. Pick up on verbal and non-verbal cues that may indicate when to change the subject or wrap up a conversation. Avoid controversial or deeply personal topics unless you are sure that the person you are talking to is open to discussing them. Furthermore, be mindful of time, as lengthy conversations may lead to awkward silence. Curating a comfortable environment for everyone leads to more enjoyable interactions and stronger bonds. 4. Bring Your Phone but Use it Wisely Having your phone handy may appear contradictory to engaging in a wholesome conversation. However, using it wisely can save everyone from potential awkwardness, like when searching for a shared talking point such as a video or an article. Nevertheless, be mindful of screen time and avoid getting absorbed in your device to maintain a strong connection with the person you are talking to. 5. Let Them Know if You Feel Uncomfortable In the event that you feel uncomfortable or threatened during any social interaction, it is crucial to express your feelings. Politely let the person know that the topic of conversation is causing discomfort and suggest a change of subject. Establishing boundaries and asserting yourself can foster healthier relationships and create an atmosphere of mutual respect. 6. Invite Someone Else to Join the Conversation Should you find yourself in an uncomfortable one-on-one conversation, consider inviting someone else to participate. This tactic not only diffuses the tension but also provides an opportunity to bring fresh perspectives and ideas into the discussion. By doing so, the entire interaction may become more enjoyable as conversation flows with the additional input. 7. Go Somewhere Else Finally, if all else fails or the environment becomes intolerable, politely remove yourself from the situation. Suggesting to move to a different location or pausing the conversation to grab a drink provides a natural exit strategy. Navigating uncomfortable scenarios with grace protects your well-being while maintaining a positive atmosphere for others present.   Conclusion Cultivating a positive environment for social interaction is paramount for healthy relationships and emotional well-being. By adopting these guidelines, one can nurture fulfilling connections with friends, family, and colleagues while effectively managing any awkward or uncomfortable situations that may arise. Fostering pleasant and respectful communication not only improves personal experiences but also contributes to the overall harmony among the people in our lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As he limps through the casino and passes people, their luck immediately goes sour. Roulette wheels, blackjack cards, crap tables and slot machines all stop paying out. Bernie then wanders over to Doris, the barmaid, who pours him a coffee. He asks for cream, but as she starts to pour it the creamer runs dry.A pretty blonde waitress, Natalie Belisario (Maria Bello) brings a drink order to the bar. Bernie tries to chat with her, but she is clearly distracted. She asks Doris if Shelly left word for her; he was supposed to put her at the tables rather than the nickel slots she's been stuck at.

Around 3:00 AM Tuesday morning, Michigan State Police spotted a driver doing 79 mph in a 70 mph zone on I-75 near the Detroit suburb of Woodhaven and initiated a pursuit.      Seconds later the 2005 Dodge Magnum station wagon had accelerated to 153 mph, according to the police car’s moving radar system.      After travelling about 10 miles down the highway, the car exited and pulled into a parking lot behind a building where police apprehended him and charged him with reckless driving, WWJ-TV reports.      The 2005 Magnum was available with a 350 hp V8 engine, but came from the factory with a speed restrictor set at 130 mph and could reportedly reach just 143 mph without it, suggesting the car in this situation had been modified.      Police say the 21-year-old had a clean record and didn’t offer any explanation for his actions, but he now faces up to six points on his license and a maximum of 93 days in jail. ||||| WOODHAVEN (WWJ) – A young man who drove a little too fast and furious on a Downriver freeway could possibly wind up in jail.      Michigan State Police Lt. Mike Shaw said the situation unfolded around 3 a.m. Tuesday as troopers were running traffic detail on northbound I-75 near West Road in Woodhaven.      “They clocked a vehicle preceding 79 in a 70 mile an hour zone,” Shaw told WWJ’s Laura Bonnell. “As the troopers turned around on the vehicle to effect a traffic stop, the vehicle was clocked on their moving radar at approximately a mile down the road from where they first initially saw him, at 153 miles an hour.”      Troopers followed the vehicle until it exited at Eureka Road and pulled behind a business.      “In the parking lot, troopers made contact with the driver, at which time he was arrested for reckless driving,” Shaw said.      The 21-year-old Lincoln Park man, who has no prior driving offenses, was processed at the state police metro post in Taylor and his 2005 Dodge Magnum was impounded. Authorities are now seeking charges from the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office.      “It’s six points on your driving record and it depends, but you could do 93 days in jail and a fine, depending on what the judge sentences,” said Shaw.      The man didn’t give an explanation for why he was driving so fast, but he was traveling more than 2.5 miles per minute. Shaw said there’s absolutely no reason for any driver to reach speeds of that magnitude.      “The roads are not designed for 150 miles an hour and most of our drivers probably aren’t professionally trained to drive at that speed,” said Shaw. “Unfortunately, some of the cars that are out on the roads today can do that speed, but we don’t recommend 150 mile an hour anywhere in Michigan’s road system.” ||||| Summary:","output":"A 21-year-old driver was spotted by Michigan State Police doing 79 mph in a 70 mph zone on I-75 near Woodhaven, which led to a police pursuit.

Given the background: The first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of 'recession velocities', mostly by Vesto Slipher, combined with distances to the 'nebulae' (galaxies) by Edwin Hubble in a  work published in 1929. Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our Milky Way Galaxy. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. Spectra taken of these distant galaxies showed a red shift in their spectral lines presumably caused by the Doppler effect, thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.  and the situation: Bob is an astrophysicist. He was pondering about the beginning of our universe. He pinpointed the time when the universe just began to exist. He labeled it as point A. To compare it with present situation of the universe he labeled the present time as point B.  Answer the following question: In which time the redshift was greater, point A or point B?","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the relevant concepts and think step-by-step: 1. Redshift: Redshift is the phenomenon where the spectral lines of an object are shifted towards the red end of the spectrum due to the Doppler effect. This occurs when an object is moving away from the observer. In the context of the universe, the redshift of a galaxy serves as an indicator of its distance and relative velocity. 2. Expansion of the universe: As mentioned in the background information, the universe is expanding, and the farther away a galaxy is, the greater its redshift, meaning it is moving away faster. 3. Point A and Point B: Point A represents the beginning of the universe, and Point B represents the present time. Now that we've broken down the concepts, we can analyze the situation: At Point A, the universe had just begun, and everything was closer together. As time passed and the universe expanded, galaxies moved away from each other, leading to an increase in redshift. At Point B, the present time, galaxies have continued to move away from each other due to the expansion of the universe. This results in an increase in redshift as well, since farther galaxies have greater redshifts. Comparing both points in time, we can conclude that the redshift is greater at Point B (present time) than it was at Point A (the beginning of the universe). This is because the universe has expanded over time and galaxies have moved further apart."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

PUBLISHED:. 21:07 EST, 30 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 21:08 EST, 30 July 2013. The ongoing spat over national security spending between Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reached a fever pitch on Tuesday, with Paul referring to the plus-sized Christie as 'the king of bacon.' 'This is the king of bacon talking about bacon,' Paul told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Both are considered potential 2016 contenders for the Republican presidential nomination. Paul's remark was in response to Christie's comments earlier in the day that Paul brings millions in 'pork' spending back to his home state of Kentucky. How Rude! Senator Rand Paul called Chris Christie - the plus-sized governor of New Jersey - 'the king of bacon' 'So if Senator Paul wants to start looking at where he's going to cut. spending to afford defense, maybe he should start cutting the pork. barrel spending that he brings home to Kentucky,' Christie told reporters. Christie last week criticized Paul’s opposition to warrantless federal surveillance programs, saying it harmed efforts to prevent terrorism. Paul told reporters after speaking at a fundraiser outside Nashville on Sunday that Christie’s position hurts GOP chances in national elections, and that spending priorities of critics like the governor and Rep. Peter King of New York do more to harm national security. 'They’re precisely the same people who are unwilling to cut the spending, and their \\"Gimme, gimme, gimme — give me all my Sandy money now.’” Paul said, referring to federal funding after the hurricane last year. 'Those are the people who are bankrupting the government and not letting enough money be left over for national defense.' The king: Christie has been struggling with his weight for years and recently underwent gastric band surgery. King in a phone interview late Sunday called Paul’s criticism of Sandy aid 'indefensible.' 'This was absolutely life or death money that was essential to New York and New Jersey,' King said. Christie, at a forum in Colorado on Thursday, pointed to a 'strain of libertarianism' coursing through both parties as a 'very dangerous thought' more than a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. Christie was asked whether he was referring to Paul, a fellow potential Republican presidential candidate who has been at the forefront of the party’s libertarian wing. 'You can name any number of people and he’s one of them,' said Christie. 'These esoteric, intellectual debates — I want them to come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation. And they won’t, because that’s a much tougher conversation to have.' War of words: Christie and Paul have been feuding for weeks about Paul's libertarian leanings. Paul on Sunday rejected arguments that the National Security Agency’s collection of hundreds of millions of U.S. phone and Internet records is necessary to prevent terrorism. 'I don’t mind spying on terrorists,' he said. 'I just don’t like spying on all Americans.' Paul said the issue resonates particularly with young people, a key demographic Republicans need to attract in order to succeed in national elections. 'If you talk about some privacy issues like that, I think you will find youth coming to you,' said Paul, who said his own decision on whether to run for president won’t come until next year. King called that argument misguided. 2016: Both Christie and Paul are considered to be potential presidential candidates for the 2016 election. 'When it comes to national defense, we shouldn’t be pandering to any demographic,' he said. 'We need to do what’s best for the country.' Messages left with Christie’s office late Sunday were not immediately returned. As for the back and forth with Christie, Paul said he wasn’t the one itching for a fight. 'I didn’t start this one, and I don’t plan on starting things by criticizing other Republicans,' he said. 'But if they want to make me the target, they will get it back in spades.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses the ongoing spat over national security spending between Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, both of whom are potential contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

Without any greeting, I had to wait for several minutes at the entrance before I was finally ushered to a table next to a noisy kitchen. The slow service only seemed to get worse from there. After waiting for over 20 minutes to have our orders taken, we started questioning the choice of coming to this restaurant. When the food finally arrived after nearly an hour, there was little to be excited about. My steak was severely overcooked and had a burnt taste, while the vegetables were soggy and flavorless. My dining partner's pasta was swimming in a pool of watery sauce, and the overall presentation was unappetizing. Even the ambiance of the place was unbearable. The lighting was harsh and uninviting, and the constant clanging noises from the kitchen made it impossible to hold a conversation. The only saving grace came in the form of our hardworking server, who did her best to be attentive despite the chaos around her.

Next, we need to solve for \\"w\\". But before that, let's simplify the equation by combining the numbers on the right side: 112153 - 663904 = -551751 So our simplified equation is: -9999*w + 718122 = -551751 3. Now, let's get all the numbers (constants) to one side and the \\"w\\" term to the other side. We'll subtract 718122 from both sides of the equation: -9999*w + 718122 - 718122 = -551751 - 718122 -9999*w = -1269873 4. To find the value of \\"w\\", we have to divide both sides by -9999: w = -1269873 / -9999 w = 127 So the answer is \\"w = 127\\".

Question: What does Matthew try to do when seeing Patty and Crick fighting? Movie title: 100 Girls Movie plot: After leaving a party at a women's dormitory (aka the \\"virgin vault\\"), Matthew (Jonathan Tucker) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark. When Matthew wakes up in the morningâstill in the elevatorâhe finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.[1] On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the virgin vault. After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps. He convinces the panicked women to leave their rooms and then starts to look for a match. When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman. He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as \\"Jane-ites\\", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by Jane Austen. He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women. Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the \\"bra matching the panties\\", and Matthew accuses him of being too machismo. Rod introduces Matthew to the \\"penile power\\", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size. He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from hypospadias. Early on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick (Johnny Green) fight. Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. He wears a pony-tail, a manicured goatee, \\"male make-up\\", and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew's dismay. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 0 = 50*r - 42*r + 88*r + 1056 for r.","output":"To solve the equation 0 = 50*r - 42*r + 88*r + 1056 for r, we first need to simplify the equation by combining the terms with r together. Step 1: Combine like terms The like terms are 50*r, -42*r, and 88*r. To combine them, add or subtract their coefficients. 50*r - 42*r + 88*r = (50 - 42 + 88)*r = 96*r Now, the simplified equation is: 0 = 96*r + 1056 Step 2: Solve for r To solve for r, we need to isolate r by getting it on one side of the equation and the constants on the other side. First, we will move the constant term (1056) to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. This will give us 0 - 1056 = 96*r - 1056 + 1056 => -1056 = 96*r Now, to isolate r, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of r, which is 96. -1056 / 96 = 96*r / 96 => -11 = r So the solution to the equation 0 = 50*r - 42*r + 88*r + 1056 is r = -11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question The basis for classical economics forms Adam Smith's An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. Smith criticized mercantilism, advocating a system of free trade with division of labour. He postulated an \\"invisible hand\\" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. Karl Marx developed an alternative economic theory, called Marxian economics. Marxian economics is based on the labor theory of value and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, capitalism was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The Austrian school responded to Marxian economics by viewing entrepreneurship as driving force of economic development. This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of supply and demand. What idea did Adam Smith propose?","output":"Adam Smith proposed the idea of an \\"invisible hand\\" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest.

Village A displayed traces of a large population that grew larger over the years, while village B had a small and declining population and was more isolated geographically.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which village didn't display an observable Allee effect?  Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

As stated by the rapporteur, Mr Manders, the Commission will also evaluate the link between allergies and chemicals used in textile products. Translate to Finnish Finnish:","output":"Kuten esittelijä, herra Manders totesi, komissio arvioi myös yhteyden allergioiden ja tekstiilituotteissa käytettyjen kemikaalien välillä. Suomeksi: Kuten raportoija, herra Manders mainitsi, komissio tulee myös arvioimaan allergioiden ja tekstiilituotteissa käytettävien kemiallisten aineiden välisen yhteyden. Tämä on tärkeää, sillä kuluttajien terveyden suojeluun liittyvät kysymykset ovat olennainen osa tekstiilialaa ja tuotteiden turvallisuutta. Allergiat ovat yleinen ongelma, ja on tärkeää ymmärtää, miten erilaiset kemikaalit vaikuttavat näihin terveysongelmiin. Arvioitaessa allergioiden ja kemikaalien välistä yhteyttä on otettava huomioon monia tekijöitä. Yksi näistä tekijöistä on se, millaisia kemiallisia aineita tekstiilituotteissa yleensä käytetään, kuten väriaineet, pehmennysaineet, kyllästysaineet ja palonestoaineet. Näillä aineilla voi olla erilaisia vaikutuksia ihmisten terveyteen, minkä vuoksi niiden käyttöä on säänneltävä. Lisäksi tulee ottaa huomioon kemikaalien pitoisuudet ja altistumisen kesto. Joskus matalatkin pitoisuudet voivat pitkäaikaisessa altistumisessa aiheuttaa allergisia reaktioita ihmisillä, jotka ovat herkkiä tietyille aineille. Myös eri yksilöiden väliset geneettiset erot voivat vaikuttaa siihen, miten he reagoivat altistuessaan kemikaaleille. Eri maiden ja alueiden lainsäädäntö voi myös vaikuttaa käytettyjen kemikaalien saantoon ja siten allergiariskeihin. Vaikka Euroopan unionissa on tiukat kemikaalien käyttöä koskevat säädökset esimerkiksi REACH-asetuksen myötä, on tärkeää varmistaa, että myös EU:n ulkopuolelta tuoduissa tuotteissa noudatetaan samoja standardeja. Tämä voi auttaa vähentämään allergioita aiheuttavien kemikaalien riskiä kuluttajille. Tutkimus ja innovaatio ovat myös keskeisessä asemassa allergioiden ja kemikaalien välisen yhteyden ymmärtämisessä. Tekstiilialan kehityksen myötä uusia kemiallisia aineita kehitetään jatkuvasti, ja niitä voidaan hyödyntää tekstiilituotteiden parantamiseksi. Samalla on kuitenkin tärkeää tutkia ja ymmärtää näiden aineiden vaikutuksia ihmisten terveyteen, jotta voidaan kehittää tehokkaita strategioita ja ratkaisuja allergiariskin minimointiin. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että komission suorittaman allergioiden ja tekstiilituotteissa käytettyjen kemikaalien välisen yhteyden arvioinnin on otettava huomioon useita seikkoja, kuten kemikaalien tyypit, pitoisuudet, altistumisen kesto sekä lainsäädännölliset erot ja innovaatio. Tämän arvioinnin avulla voidaan saavuttaa parempi ymmärrys allergiariskeistä ja auttaa kehittämään tehokkaita toimenpiteitä allergioiden ehkäisemiseksi ja kuluttajien terveyden suojelemiseksi."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole.

It is a natural response designed to protect us from potential threats. However, when fear becomes overwhelming, it can have negative effects on our mental health, relationships, and overall well-being. This article will explore the different steps to identify and conquer fear, enabling you to live a more fulfilling life. 1. Notice symptoms of fear The first step in overcoming fear is to recognize its symptoms. These can manifest in physical, emotional, and behavioral changes. Some common indications of fear include: - Rapid heartbeat - Sweating - Nausea or dizziness - Difficulty breathing - Trembling or shaking - Feeling of being trapped - Inability to focus or think clearly - Irritability or mood swings - Avoidance of certain situations or objects By identifying these symptoms, you'll be more equipped to tackle your fear head-on. 2. Figure out what you're afraid of Once you have identified the symptoms of fear, it's essential to understand the source. This can stem from various factors, including past traumatic experiences, irrational beliefs, or genetic tendencies. Asking yourself questions like \\"What experiences have triggered this fear?\\" and \\"Is there an underlying rationale for being fearful?\\" can help you pinpoint the root cause. 3. Brainstorm solutions With a clear understanding of the source of your fear, you can start developing strategies to overcome it. It’s crucial to brainstorm different approaches, as one solution might not fit every individual or situation. Some common strategies include: - Educating yourself on the source of fear to dispel irrational beliefs - Seeking professional help such as therapy or counseling - Adopting a healthier lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet - Practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation - Surrounding yourself with a supportive network of friends and family 4. Cope with your fear Learning how to cope with fear is essential for overcoming it. This means accepting that fear is a part of life and understanding that it's possible to reduce its impact. By implementing your chosen strategies, you can gradually decrease the intensity of your fear and eventually conquer it. 5. Face your fears Exposure to your fears can be highly beneficial in overcoming them. This involves gradually confronting the feared objects, situations, or memories until you become desensitized. Facing your fears might be uncomfortable initially, but it is proven to be an effective way of weakening the hold they have over you. 6. Accept that some fear is healthy It's essential to accept that fear is a natural emotion and is necessary for our survival. A healthy level of fear keeps us aware of potential dangers and assists in making informed decisions. The key is to maintain a balance between healthy fear and irrational fear that hinders your emotional well-being. 7. Determine if your fear is overwhelming you Lastly, it is crucial to understand when fear is becoming overwhelming, potentially leading to anxiety disorders or other mental health issues. If you find that your fear is significantly affecting your daily functioning and causing significant distress, it may be time to seek professional help. An experienced mental health professional can work with you to develop coping strategies and help you regain control over your life. Conclusion Overcoming fear is a process that will require time and effort from your end. By recognizing the symptoms, understanding the source, brainstorming solutions, and gradually facing your fears, you can regain control over your life and be liberated from the constraints of overwhelming fear. Remember, it's essential to maintain a healthy balance of fear, and seeking professional help is always an option for those who find themselves overwhelmed."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Process: - Coal is put in a coal-fired steam station - Water is put in pipes in the coal-fired steam station - The coal is crushed - The coal is moved into a boiler along with hot air - The water is moving through pipes in the boiler - The steam from the water is blown against a turning mechanism - The force of the steam makes the mechanism turn - The mechanism generates electricity.  Question: suppose less electricity needed happens, how will it affect less electricity is produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If less electricity is needed, the demand for electricity decreases. To accommodate this decrease in demand, the coal-fired steam station can reduce the quantity of coal being burnt, leading to less heat production. The steps influenced by this change would be as follows: 1. Coal is put in a coal-fired steam station (less coal is required) 2. Water is put in pipes in the coal-fired steam station (the same amount of water can be used) 3. The coal is crushed (less coal is crushed) 4. The coal is moved into a boiler along with hot air (less coal is moved) 5. The water is moving through pipes in the boiler (the water moves through at the same rate) 6. The steam from the water is blown against a turning mechanism (less steam is produced) 7. The force of the steam makes the mechanism turn (the mechanism turns slower) 8.

I'd like to be at your #openlab, but I have trouble getting there. Can you help with a teleporting device?   Select from:  -negative  -positive","output":"The sentiment of the tweet can be analyzed from various aspects. Overall, the sentiment of the tweet in question can be described as a mixture of positive and negative sentiments. Here, I'll dive into both the aspects and discuss the reasons. Positive Sentiments: 1. The opening of the tweet starts with a friendly and upbeat tone with the word 'Hey!'. 2. The tweet expresses a keen interest in attending David's #openlab, indicating some excitement or enthusiasm towards the event or the person organizing it (David). 3. The use of humor shows that the user is engaging in a lighthearted way by asking for a teleporting device, which could indicate their level of comfort with David and the event. Negative Sentiments: 1. The tweet mentions that the user is having trouble reaching the event location, which implies that they are facing difficulties and maybe mildly frustrated or disappointed. 2. In addition, the request for a teleporting device could be considered as sarcastic, possibly implying the event is too far for the user, or it is difficult for them to deal with the difficulties that come with attending the event. Considering all the points above, it is challenging to definitively classify the tweet's sentiment as entirely positive or negative. The tweet conveys a combination of positive sentiments through the excitement and enthusiasm for the #openlab event as well as the friendly tone and humor. On the other hand, it also contains negative sentiments due to the difficulty in reaching the event and possibly even mild sarcasm. However, if forced to choose between only negative or positive categorization, I would suggest that the tweet leans more toward a positive sentiment. The reason being that although it mentions a difficulty (having trouble reaching the event), the tone remains largely upbeat and enthusiastic.

What is the answer?","output":"The strikes and rioting across France in October 2010 were primarily driven by widespread opposition to proposed pension reforms by then-President Nicolas Sarkozy's government. The comprehensive answer to this issue involves examining various factors, including the French political climate, the nature of the proposed pension reforms, the role of labor unions, and the public's response. 1. Political climate in France: In 2010, France was grappling with economic challenges brought on by the global financial crisis as well as domestic issues such as high unemployment rates, public spending constraints, and concerns over the future sustainability of the French welfare system. President Nicolas Sarkozy, as part of his center-right platform, sought to implement a series of policy changes in response to these challenges. 2. Proposed pension reforms: One of the most controversial policies proposed by Sarkozy's government was the pension reform plan. At the heart of the dispute was the proposal to raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full retirement age, when individuals can claim their full pension, from 65 to 67. The government argued that these changes were necessary to address France's growing fiscal deficit, an aging population, and to ensure the long-term solvency of the pension system. 3. Role of labor unions: Labor unions, such as the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) and the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT) played a crucial role in organizing the strikes and protests against the proposed reforms. They argued that the changes would disproportionately impact low-income workers who rely on pension benefits and have shorter life expectancies. The unions also expressed concerns that the reforms could lead to increased pressure on older workers to continue working despite difficulties finding employment in a challenging job market. 4. Public's response: The broader French public seemed to share the labor unions' concerns and dissatisfaction with the proposed pension reforms. Opinion polls suggested that a majority of the French population opposed the changes, with some polls even indicating that over 70% of respondents were against the proposed increase in retirement age. This widespread disapproval translated into massive street protests, demonstrations, and strikes that spanned various sectors of the workforce, including transport, energy, education, and public services. The strikes and rioting in October 2010 escalated to the point where France experienced fuel shortages, school closures, and disruptions to public transportation. The unrest received international attention and put significant pressure on Sarkozy's government. Despite this fierce opposition, the French parliament ultimately approved the pension reform legislation by the end of October 2010, and it was enacted into law in November of the same year. The strikes and rioting represent a pivotal moment in France's recent social and political history, as they demonstrated the deep-rooted tensions between the government's efforts to respond to economic challenges and a significant portion of the population's resistance to these changes, particularly those directly impacting their social welfare."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: Which letter in the Morse code is represented by a single dot?","output":"In Morse code, the letter that is represented by a single dot is the letter \\"E\\". Morse code is a method of representing letters, numbers, and other characters by using a combination of dots and dashes (also known as dits and dahs). It was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the 1830s and was a crucial communication tool during the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly for telegraph communications. Morse code uses a system of standardized sequences of short and long signals, or marks, to represent each character. The duration of a dot is the basic unit of time measurement, and a dash is three times longer than a dot. The space between parts that make up the same letter is equal to the duration of a single dot, while the space between letters is three times that of a dot. The space between words is equal to the duration of seven dots. The simplicity of a single dot for the letter \\"E\\" in Morse code is likely due to its high frequency in the English language. Morse and Vail intended for the length of the code for each character to be roughly inversely proportional to the frequency of that character in typical messages. As a result, often-used letters such as \\"E\\" and \\"T\\" have shorter codes, while less frequently used characters have more complex codes. Here is a list of the 26 Morse code representations for the letters of the English alphabet: A: .- B: -... C: -.-. D: -.. E: . F: ..-. G: --. H: .... I: .. J: .--- K: -.- L: .-.. M: -- N: -. O: --- P: .--. Q: --.- R: .-. S: ... T: - U: ..- V: ...- W: .-- X: -..- Y: -.--  Z: --.. The invention of the Morse code significantly improved long-distance communication and laid the foundation for modern telecommunication advancements. Although it is no longer used as prominently as it once was, Morse code is still applicable in certain contexts, such as aviation and maritime communication, and is useful for people with disabilities as a means of communication. It endures as an important element in the history of technology and communication."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: While most faux suede fabrics used for clothing, towels, drapery, and other garments, accessories, or decor will be machine washable, always check the labels first to be sure. If the label is missing or too worn to read, err on the side of caution: hand wash the garment with a gentle soap or detergent and hang or lay it to dry.  A care label with a washing basin full of water on it means you can machine wash your item. If there is a number as well, this indicates the temperature at which to wash it.  For a washing basin with a hand on it, wash the garment by hand instead of the washing machine. A square with a circle inside means you can tumble dry your garment as well. A single circle means dry clean only. A triangle means it’s safe to use bleach. If any of these symbols appear on your care label with an X or cross through them, it means you cannot use that method of cleaning. Before washing or cleaning any new fabric, you should always do a spot test on the fabric to ensure that the cleaning product you want to use won’t damage the fabric in any way.  Choose a small spot on the fabric that won’t be seen, and apply a small amount of your desired cleaner to the area. Let it sit for five to 10 minutes, and blot the area with a clean, white cloth. Check to see that no color bleeding, discoloration, or shrinking has occurred. Use a damp cloth to remove the cleaner. For tough stains or hard-to-clean dirt, spot clean the stains with soapy water, a clear alcohol like isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or vodka, or a gentle liquid laundry detergent that’s been diluted in water (use a teaspoon (6 ml) of detergent in one cup (240 ml) of water). To spot clean:  Apply a small bit of cleaner to the fabric with a cloth or clean sponge. Gently rub the area with either the sponge, a lint-free cloth, or a soft-bristled brush, such as a clean toothbrush. If you use a cloth or sponge, make sure it’s white or undyed, as the dye could transfer to the fabric. Sometimes fabrics just don’t want to come clean, but there are methods you can use to remove stubborn stains from your favorite clothes.  To remove deodorant or perspiration stains, rub a small amount of liquid laundry soap into the armpit areas and let it sit for 10 minutes before washing. For oil stains, lay the stain face-down on a clean wash cloth or hand towel. Pour some liquid laundry soap onto the back of the stain and let it sit. As the oil and soap soak through and dry, replace the cloth with a clean one. Rinse the area once it has dried and launder it normally. To get rid of stubborn organic matter (such as food, beverages, grass, and blood), pre-treat the stains by rubbing them with a detergent that contains enzymes, such as OxiClean, Tide Stain Release, and Ultra Plus. Let it sit for 10 minutes and wash normally. For machine-washable items, always wash faux suede items together to prevent the material from collecting lint. Wash larger items, such as curtains and bedding, alone. To machine wash a single faux suede item, place it in a lingerie bag to separate it from the rest of the clothes in the load.  To be on the safe side, always use the delicate or gentle cycle and a mild liquid detergent when washing faux suede. To hand wash your item, fill a large bowl or sink with warm, soapy water. Place your item in the water and let it absorb the water. Gently agitate the fabric with your hands, concentrating on areas that are particularly soiled. If the care label indicates that your item is safe for the dryer, follow the heat settings, or use a low- or no-heat setting to dry your faux suede. You can also hang your items to dry on a clothesline, or lay them flat on a towel to dry. Washing faux suede can make the fabric stiff. Use a soft brush or clean toothbrush to gently brush the fabric and return its softness. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to properly wash and take care of faux suede materials, like clothes and home items. It explains the different symbols on care labels and gives tips on how to remove stubborn stains. It also tells you how to wash faux suede in a washing machine or by hand and the best way to dry it.

Question: Information:  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - An explosive eruption is a volcanic term to describe a violent, explosive type of eruption. Mount St. Helens in 1980 was an example. Such eruptions result when sufficient gas has dissolved under pressure within a viscous magma such that expelled lava violently froths into volcanic ash when pressure is suddenly lowered at the vent. Sometimes a lava plug will block the conduit to the summit, and when this occurs, eruptions are more violent. Explosive eruptions can send rocks, dust, gas and pyroclastic material up to 20 km into the atmosphere at rate of up to 100,000 tonnes per second, traveling at several hundred meters per second. This cloud will then collapse, creating a pyroclastic flow of hot volcanic matter.  - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\".  - An effusive eruption is a type of volcanic eruption in which lava steadily flows out of a volcano onto the ground. Effusive eruption differs from explosive eruption, wherein magma is violently fragmented when expelled from a volcano. The shape of the lava flows created by effusive eruptions is governed by the type of lava, rate and duration of eruption, and slope of the surrounding areas.  - Bristol Bay (\\"Iilgayaq\\" in Central Yup'ik) is the eastern-most arm of the Bering Sea, at 57° to 59° North 157° to 162° West in Southwest Alaska. Bristol Bay is 400 km (250 mi) long and 290 km, (180 mi) wide at its mouth. A number of rivers flow into the bay, including the Cinder, Egegik, Igushik, Kvichak, Meshik, Nushagak, Naknek, Togiak, and Ugashik.  - The Alaska Peninsula is a peninsula extending about to the southwest from the mainland of Alaska and ending in the Aleutian Islands. The peninsula separates the Pacific Ocean from Bristol Bay, an arm of the Bering Sea.   - A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They are named for their low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid lava they erupt, which travels farther than lava erupted from stratovolcanoes. This results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form. The shape of shield volcanoes is due to the low viscosity of their mafic lava.  - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland.  - Andesite (or ) is an extrusive igneous, volcanic rock, of intermediate composition, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between basalt and dacite, and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide (SiO) as illustrated in TAS diagrams. The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals. Alkali feldspar may be present in minor amounts. The quartz-feldspar abundances in andesite and other volcanic rocks are illustrated in QAPF diagrams.  - Mount Dutton is a stratovolcano in the Aleutian Range of the U.S. state of Alaska , on the Alaska Peninsula .  - The Bering Strait (\\"Beringov proliv\\", Yupik: \\"Imakpik\\") is a strait of the Pacific, which borders with the Arctic to north. It is located between Russia and the United States. Named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born explorer in the service of the Russian Empire, it lies slightly south of the Arctic Circle being at about 65° 40' N latitude. The present Russia-US east-west boundary is at 168° 58' 37\\" W.  - Katmai National Park and Preserve is a United States National Park and Preserve in southern Alaska, notable for the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes and for its Alaskan brown bears. The park and preserve covers , being roughly the size of Wales. Most of this is a designated wilderness area in the national park where all hunting is banned, including over of land. The park is named after Mount Katmai, its centerpiece stratovolcano. The park is located on the Alaska Peninsula, across from Kodiak Island, with headquarters in nearby King Salmon, about southwest of Anchorage. The area was first designated a national monument in 1918 to protect the area around the major 1912 volcanic eruption of Novarupta, which formed the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, a , pyroclastic flow. The park includes as many as 18 individual volcanoes, seven of which have been active since 1900.  - The Bering Sea is a marginal sea of the Pacific Ocean. It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity. It may also be defined as: \\"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planetthose last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\\"  - Rhyolite is an igneous, volcanic rock, of felsic (silica-rich) composition (typically > 69% SiOsee the TAS classification). It may have any texture from glassy to aphanitic to porphyritic. The mineral assemblage is usually quartz, sanidine and plagioclase (in a ratio > 2:1see the QAPF diagram). Biotite and hornblende are common accessory minerals. It is the extrusive equivalent to granite.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.  - The Aleutian Range is a major mountain range located in southwest Alaska, and it extends from Chakachamna Lake (80 miles/130 km southwest of Anchorage) to Unimak Island, which is at the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. It includes all of the mountains of the peninsula, and what makes it so special is its large number of active volcanoes, which are also part of the larger Aleutian Arc. The mainland part of the range is about 600 miles (1000 km) long; the Aleutian Islands are (geologically) a partially submerged western extension of the range that stretches for another 1,600 km (1000 mi). However the official designation \\"Aleutian Range\\" includes only the mainland peaks and the peaks on Unimak Island. The range is almost entirely roadless wilderness, and Katmai National Park and Preserve, a large national park within the range, must be reached by boat or plane.  - Unimak Island is the largest island in the Aleutian Islands chain of the U.S. state of Alaska.  - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.  - Yukon (also commonly called the Yukon) is the westernmost and smallest of Canada's three federal territories (the other two are Northwest Territories and Nunavut). The territory is very sparsely populated with its about 35,000 people on almost half a million square kilometres. Whitehorse is the territorial capital and Yukon's only city.  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - In geology, felsic refers to igneous rocks that are relatively rich in elements that form feldspar and quartz. It is contrasted with mafic rocks, which are relatively richer in magnesium and iron. It refers to those rocks rich in silicate minerals, magma, and rocks which are enriched in the lighter elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium.  - Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity. It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation.  - Pumice, called pumicite in its powdered or dust form, is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals. It is typically light colored. Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser.  - The Anchorage Metropolitan Statistical Area , as defined by the United States Census Bureau, is an area consisting of the Municipality of Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough in the south central region of Alaska.  - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains.  British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.  - The Aleutian Arc is a large volcanic arc in the U.S. state of Alaska. It consists of a number of active and dormant volcanoes that have formed as a result of subduction along the Aleutian Trench. Although taking its name from the Aleutian Islands, this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Aleutian Arc extends through the Alaska Peninsula following the Aleutian Range to the Aleutian Islands.  - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as .  - Attu is the westernmost and largest island in the Near Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and the westernmost point of land relative to Alaska, the United States, North America and the Americas. The island became uninhabited in 2010.  - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - Dacite is an igneous, volcanic rock. It has an aphanitic to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite. The word dacite comes from Dacia, a province of the Roman Empire which lay between the Danube River and Carpathian Mountains (now modern Romania and Moldova) where the rock was first described.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the city that was bombed in the Bristol Blitz? is inside the article: Bristol, the largest city in South West England, has an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church. The construction of the city's Floating Harbour, taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome, provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure. Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, but is now closed.The 20th century saw further expansion of the city, the growth of the University of Bristol and the arrival of the aircraft industry. During World War II, the city centre was extensively bombed in the Bristol Blitz. The redevelopment of shopping centres, office buildings, and the harbourside continues to this day., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The name of the city that was bombed in the Bristol Blitz is Bristol, as mentioned in the text: \\"During World War II, the city centre was extensively bombed in the Bristol Blitz.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Objective: Established preclinical disease models are essential for not only studying aetiology and/or pathophysiology of the relevant diseases but more importantly also for testing prevention and/or treatment concept(s). The present study proposed and established a detailed induction and assessment protocol for a unique and cost-effective preclinical steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) in rats with pulsed injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone (MPS). Methods: Sixteen 24-week-old male SpragueeDawley rats were used to induce SAON by one intravenous injection of LPS (0.2 mg/kg) and three intraperitoneal injections of MPS (100 mg/kg) with a time interval of 24 hour, and then, MPS (40 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected three times a week from week 2 until sacrifice. Additional 12 rats were used as normal controls. Two and six weeks after induction, animals were scanned by metabolic dual energy Xray absorptiometry for evaluation of tissue composition; serum was collected for bone turnover markers, Microfil perfusion was performed for angiography, the liver was collected for histopathology and bilateral femora and bilateral tibiae were collected for histological examination. Results: Three rats died after LPS injection, i.e., with 15.8% (3/19) mortality. Histological evaluation showed 100% incidence of SAON at week 2. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed significantly higher fat percent and lower lean mass in SAON group at week 6. Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) showed significant bone degradation at proximal tibia 6 weeks after SAON induction. Angiography illustrated significantly less blood vessels in the Journal of Orthopaedic Translation (2018) 13, 13e24 proximal tibia and significantly more leakage particles in the distal tibia 2 weeks after SAON induction. Serum amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen and osteocalcin were significantly lower at both 2 and 6 weeks after SAON induction, and serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide was significantly lower at 6 weeks after SAON induction. Histomorphometry revealed significantly lower osteoblast surface and higher marrow fat fraction and oedema area in SAON group. Hepatic oedema appeared 2 weeks after SAON induction, and lipid accumulation appeared in the liver of SAON rats 6 weeks after SAON induction. Conclusion: The present study successfully induced SAON in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS, which was well simulating the clinical feature and pathology. Apart from available large animal models, such as bipedal emus or quadrupedal rabbits, our current SAON small model in rats could be a cost-effective preclinical experimental model to study body metabolism, molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention or treatment of SAON. The translational potential of this article: The present study successfully induced SAON in a small animal model in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS. The evaluation protocols with typical histopathologic ON features and advanced evaluation approaches to identify the metabolic disorders of SAON could be used in future rat SAON studies. The SAON rat model is a suitable and cost-effective animal model to study molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention and treatment of SAON.

Article: Carbon monoxide poisoning   causes death and injuries around the world. This gas is a problem in all parts of the world that experience cold weather. A few years ago, America's Centers for Disease Control (C. D. C.) studied deaths linked   with carbon monoxide poisoning. It found that the number of carbon monoxide deaths in the United States was greatest in January. The C.D.C. also found that carbon monoxide kills more than four hundred Americans each year. And, it said more than twenty thousand people are taken to hospital for treatment of health problems linked with the gas. Carbon monoxide is called the silent killer because people do not know it is in the air. The gas has no color, no taste and no smell. It does not cause burning eyes. And it does not cause people to cough. Yet, carbon monoxide gas is very deadly  . It steals the body's ability to use oxygen. Carbon monoxide makes it difficult for the blood to carry oxygen to body tissues  . It does this by linking with the blood. When the gas links with the blood, the blood is no longer able to carry oxygen to the tissues that need it. Damage   to the body can begin very quickly from large amounts   of carbon monoxide. How quickly this can happen depend on how long a person is breathing the gas and how much gas he or she breathes in. Carbon monoxide poisoning has warning signs . But people have to be awake to realize them. Small amounts of the gas will cause a person's head to hurt. He or she may begin to feel tired. Their stomachs may feel sick. The room may appear to be turning around. The person may have trouble thinking clearly. People develop serious headache as the amount of the gas continues to enter their blood. They will begin to feel very tired and sleepy. They may have terrible stomachache. Doctors say carbon monoxide influences people differently. For example a small child will experience health problems or die much sooner than an adult. The general health of the person or his or her age can also be important. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? - Carbon monoxide poisoning seldom happens in cold areas. - Twenty thousand Americans are killed by carbon monoxide each year. - Most people know whether there is carbon monoxide in the air. - Carbon monoxide stops the blood from carrying oxygen to body tissues.

New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Warbringer is an American thrash metal band formed in 2004.

Wladyslaw Gomulka (Polish: [vwa'diswaf go'muwka]; 6 February 1905 - 1 September 1982) was a Polish communist politician. He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \\"Polish way to socialism\\"; and giving rise to the period known as \\"Gomulka's thaw\\". Wladyslaw Gomulka was born on 6 February 1905 in Bialobrzegi Franciszkanskie village on the outskirts of Krosno, into a worker's family living in the Austrian Partition (the Galicia region). His parents had met and married in the United States, where each had emigrated in search of work in the late 19th century, but returned to occupied Poland in the early 20th century because Wladyslaw's father Jan was unable to find gainful employment in America. Jan Gomulka then worked as a laborer in the Subcarpathian oil industry. Wladyslaw's older sister Jozefa, born in the US, returned there upon turning eighteen to join her extended family, most of whom had emigrated, and to preserve her US citizenship. Wladyslaw and his two other siblings experienced a childhood of the proverbial Galician poverty: they lived in a dilapidated hut and ate mostly potatoes. Wladyslaw received only rudimentary education before being employed in the oil industry of the region.  Gomulka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen, when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop. Throughout his life Gomulka was an avid reader and accomplished a great deal of self-education, but remained a subject of jokes because of his lack of formal education and demeanor.  In 1922, Gomulka passed his apprenticeship exams and began working at a local refinery. The re-established Polish state of Gomulka's teen years was a scene of growing political polarization and radicalization. The young worker developed connections with the radical Left, joining the Sila (Power) youth organization in 1922 and the Independent Peasant Party in 1925. Gomulka was known for his activism in the metal workers and, from 1922, chemical industry unions. He was involved in union-organized strikes and in 1924, during a protest gathering in Krosno, participated in a polemical debate with Herman Lieberman. He published radical texts in leftist newspapers. In May 1926 the young Gomulka was for the first time arrested, but soon released because of worker demands. The incident was the subject of a parliamentary intervention by the Peasant Party. In October 1926, Gomulka became a secretary of the managing council in the Chemical Industry Workers Union for the Drohobych District and remained involved with that communist-dominated union until 1930. He around this time learned on his own basic Ukrainian. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Where was he born?","output":"Wladyslaw Gomulka was born on 6 February 1905 in Bialobrzegi Franciszkanskie village on the outskirts of Krosno, in the Austrian Partition (the Galicia region).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Peter Morgan, 54, of Llanellen, Monmouthshire, is accused of strangling Georgina Symonds, 25, in January. The father-of-two denies murder at Newport Crown Court. On Wednesday, her mother Deborah told jurors Georgina Symonds - who was paid up to £10,000-a-month to be his personal escort - knew everything about him and \\"thought she could ruin him\\". The court has previously heard how Mr Morgan lavished Georgina Symonds, from the Allt-yr-yn area of Newport, with expensive gifts including helicopter rides and spa days. He planted a listening device disguised as a white plug socket in a bungalow he owned in Llanmartin, Newport, where he allowed the mother-of-one to live rent-free. He overheard Georgina Symonds tell her new boyfriend Tom Ballinger she planned to leave married Mr Morgan and blackmail him. On Wednesday, her mother told the court she threatened to tell his family how she had met him and had a photograph with him and another escort in his marital home, Beech Hill Farm in Usk. Deborah Symonds said: \\"She threatened to tell everyone about them and thought she could ruin him. \\"She said, 'I know Peter Morgan keeps about £50,000 at home and I'm going to do this warts and all. \\"'He is hiding from the taxman and he has also built property that hasn't met building regulations'.\\" Mr Morgan had promised to sign over the bungalow Georgina Symonds was living in at Pencoed Castle, the court heard, and he had taken out a life insurance policy for £1m which she would receive if he died. Deborah Symonds, a residential services officer, also said her daughter wanted to hurt Mr Morgan following the death of her ex-boyfriend in November 2015, so he would feel pain like she did. The court heard she was left \\"heartbroken\\" but Mr Morgan \\"didn't seem to care\\". \\"She was trying to do things to upset him, to make him feel hurt,\\" Deborah Symonds said. Married Mr Ballinger told the court he met Georgina Symonds at a wake at the bungalow. \\"Whilst we were outside George said to me 'my heart's racing' and I said 'so is mine',\\" he said. \\"She said 'did you feel that? It feels like love to me'.\\" They began texting and had sex days later. Mr Ballinger said: \\"She said she was going to finish with Peter Morgan. \\"She was going to go back to work as an escort. She said quite clearly she was going to leave him after he gave her the bungalow.\\" But he told the court he could not remember what was said during the conversation with Miss Symonds on January 10 that was overheard by Mr Morgan. Miss Symonds' best friend Alexy Butcher told the court Mr Morgan - known as Rich Pete - was \\"smitten\\" with Georgina Symonds but she was \\"only with him for the money\\". She turned to alcohol and drugs and was \\"very depressed\\" over the death of her ex-boyfriend and \\"tried to take her own life\\", Ms Butcher said. \\"Peter Morgan was helping her with her grief as much as he could but she blamed him. She wasn't very nice to him,\\" she added. The trial continues. This article was about:","output":"A man named Peter Morgan is accused of hurting a woman named Georgina Symonds.

Fact 2: Thus swimming is defined as a special kind of moving, namely moving in or through water.  Given the two facts above, a long tail can be used for _ by an animal? The answer is:","output":"Given the two facts above, a long tail can be used for swimming by an animal.  A long tail can serve several vital functions for animals, one of which is enhancing their mobility in the water. These tails come in different shapes and sizes, depending on the species and their specific needs, but they generally act as a propeller or a rudder, enabling animals to move effectively and efficiently through the water. Swimming is a mode of locomotion that enables animals to move through water by generating thrust and maneuvering their bodies. This is distinct from other forms of motion, such as walking or flying, where the animals typically use their limbs or wings to generate lift, balance, and directional control. In water, animals face different challenges because it is a denser and more viscous medium compared to air, and thus they need specialized adaptations to overcome these challenges and function optimally. A long tail is particularly useful for swimming due to several reasons: 1. Propulsion: The tail can create forward thrust by moving it from side to side or in an undulating manner, propelling the animal through the water. Examples of this can be seen in fish and marine mammals like dolphins and whales, where their tails generate most of the propulsive force that moves them through the water. 2. Stability and Maneuverability: A long tail can act as a stabilizer or a rudder, allowing animals to maintain balance, change direction, and performs various acrobatic moves in the water. For instance, crocodiles use their powerful, long tails to help them navigate swiftly in water, while newts and salamanders use their tails for balance and precise movements. 3. Energy Efficiency: A long tail can allow animals to be more energy-efficient when moving through water, as it may generate more thrust by using its length and surface area, minimizing drag, and facilitating smooth movement. This attribute helps animals reduce the effort required to swim, enabling them to cover greater distances or forage for longer periods underwater. 4. Adaptations for Habitat and Lifestyle: For some animals, having a long tail for swimming is essential for survival, as their habitats and lifestyle require them to move through water regularly. For example, the long tail plays a crucial role for semiaquatic mammals like beavers and otters, as they rely on their tails for propulsion and steering while foraging for food and escaping from predators. In conclusion, the answer to the given question is that a long tail can be used for swimming by an animal. A long tail serves various functions, including providing propulsion, stability, and maneuverability, offering energy efficiency, and aiding in adaptations for specific habitats and lifestyles. These characteristics make it an essential evolutionary adaptation for many animals that inhabit aquatic or semiaquatic environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Having both parties sign the contract demonstrates their agreement with the terms and their commitment to fulfilling their respective obligations. Option (a) is incorrect because simply having one party sign the contract does not create a legally binding agreement.

I've found that it can make even the dullest jobs enjoyable and help clear mental blocks to creativity. I first noticed the good effects of music while playing video games. It was a few days before Christmas in 2005 and I was playing online video games. My parents had just given me a new MP3,so I decided to listen to music through the headphones while I played. After a few minutes I noticed a great change in my style of play. I was playing more naturally. The music relaxed me,and,to a certain extent,distracted me from the game,allowing my subconscious talent to come through. The music also helped me block out the outside world. With those headphones on I was like a machine,moving from one task to the next without unnecessary thoughts or actions. Music can also have a great effect on mood. If I'm in a bad mood at work,I'll listen to some of Bob Marley's and get down to business. It always takes my mind off what I'm doing and makes me a happier person. The same is true for classic rock. One summer,I did a boring job collecting bottle openers by hand. Without a radio playing classic rock in the background,I would have hated life.

Q:Information:  - The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, the United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank Jack Fletcher, and Raymond A. Spruance decisively defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto, Chuichi Nagumo, and Nobutake Kondo near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. Military historian John Keegan called it \\"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare.\\"  - Yamamoto held several important posts in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and undertook many of its changes and reorganizations, especially its development of naval aviation. He was the commander-in-chief during the decisive early years of the Pacific War and so was responsible for major battles such as Pearl Harbor and Midway. He died when American codebreakers identified his flight plans and his plane was shot down. His death was a major blow to Japanese military morale during World War II.  - Midway Atoll (also called Midway Island and Midway Islands; Hawaiian: \\"Pihemanu Kauihelani\\") is a atoll in the North Pacific Ocean at . As its name suggests, Midway is roughly equidistant between North America and Asia. Midway Atoll is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States. Midway continues to be the only island in the Hawaiian archipelago that is not part of the state of Hawaii. Unlike the other Hawaiian islands, Midway observes Samoa Time (i.e., eleven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time), which is one hour behind the time in the state of Hawaii. For statistical purposes, Midway is grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands. The Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, encompassing of land and water (mostly water) in the surrounding area, is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The refuge and most of its surrounding area are part of the larger Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument.  - The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the country's seven uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission (with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters) and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its mission set. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. This has happened twice, in 1917, during World War I, and in 1941, during World War II.  - The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought during 48 May 1942, was a major naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. The battle was the first action in which aircraft carriers engaged each other, as well as the first in which neither side's ships sighted or fired directly upon the other.  - The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN; Kyjitai: Shinjitai: \\"\\" or \\"Nippon Kaigun\\", \\"Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire\\") was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 until 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff and the Ministry of the Navy, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) was formed after the dissolution of the IJN.  - The attack on Pearl Harbor, also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, and Operation Z during planning, was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory, on the morning of December 7, 1941. The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II.  - Pearl Harbor is a lagoon harbor on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, west of Honolulu. Much of the harbor and surrounding lands is a United States Navy deep-water naval base. It is also the headquarters of the United States Pacific Fleet. The U.S. government first obtained exclusive use of the inlet and the right to maintain a repair and coaling station for ships here in 1887. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941 was the immediate cause of the United States' entry into World War II.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage.

Write an article based on this summary: – It's being described as a landmark decision in favor of privacy: The Supreme Court ruled Friday that the government in most cases needs a warrant to track a person's location by grabbing data from cellphone towers. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four liberal-leaning justices and wrote the majority opinion, though he added that warrants can be skipped in emergency situations to avert an imminent threat, reports USA Today. The case stems from a series of armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio in 2010 and 2011. Under the Stored Communications Act of 1986, the government obtained cellphone records for suspect Timothy Carpenter that revealed 12,898 location points over 127 days, reports CNET. He was later sentenced to 116 years in prison, per the Guardian. Friday's ruling says obtaining an \\"all-encompassing record\\" of a person's whereabouts without a warrant is a form of unreasonable search and seizure. \\"The Government's position fails to contend with the seismic shifts in digital technology that made possible the tracking of not only Carpenter's location but also everyone else's, not for a short period but for years and years,\\" Roberts writes, noting that people \\"compulsively carry cell phones with them all the time.\\" In a rare move, all four dissenting justices wrote their own opinions. For example, Samuel Alito said the ruling \\"guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.\\"","output":"Landmark Supreme Court Ruling on Privacy and Cellphone Tracking Data In a landmark decision that is being hailed as a victory for privacy rights, the United States Supreme Court ruled that in most cases, the government requires a warrant to track a person's location by acquiring data from cellphone towers. This ruling is expected to have a significant impact on the balance between privacy and security in the digital age. The case under review involved Timothy Carpenter, who was sentenced to 116 years in prison following a string of armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio between 2010 and 2011. As part of the investigation, the government obtained Carpenter's cellphone records under the Stored Communications Act of 1986, revealing 12,898 location points over 127 days. According to Friday's ruling, obtaining such comprehensive records of a person's whereabouts without a warrant is a form of unreasonable search and seizure. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court's four liberal-leaning judges and penned the majority opinion. While he acknowledged that there may be circumstances in which warrants can be skipped to prevent imminent threats, he argued that the government's position fails to take into account the substantial advancements in digital technology which enable the tracking of not only Carpenter's location but also that of everyone else, for extended periods. Roberts noted that many people \\"compulsively carry cell phones with them all the time,\\" and posited that tracking their location without a warrant is an invasion of privacy. This point of view reflects the growing concern among privacy advocates that the current digital landscape offers opportunities for excessive surveillance, with potentially negative consequences for civil liberties. In a rare move, all four dissenting justices wrote their own opinions on the ruling. Justice Samuel Alito, for example, argued that the decision \\"guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely.\\" This perspective is shared by many in the law enforcement community who believe that the ruling may impede their ability to investigate cases and bring perpetrators to justice. This new ruling is expected to spark debate on how to strike the right balance between protecting privacy and ensuring security in a world where technology continues to evolve rapidly. It remains to be seen how this shift in judicial thinking might influence other technology-focused legislation and court rulings in the future. In summary, the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision favoring privacy marks a significant turning point in the ongoing debate between privacy rights and security concerns, especially in the digital age. As technology continues to rapidly advance, it is crucial that the legal system adapts and provides appropriate protections for citizens' privacy, while still enabling the pursuit of justice. This ruling is a clear indication that the highest court in the land acknowledges the importance of reevaluating the balance between these two crucial aspects of modern life."},{"instruction":"In this task you will be given an answer to a question.

As the hitmen walk toward North's upstairs classroom, the teacher receives a phone call from the blind principal's aide, warning him of their arrival. However, a saddened Johnny responds, \\"It's okay.

Lee also notes that from the look on Johnny's face when they entered the classroom is that he wanted them to kill him. It is revealed here that both Charlie and Lee were annoymously sub-contracted by an unseen party to kill Johnny North. It is apparent that the hitmen's business is not to make any direct contact with their paying clients, or know their names, just the name of their hit. Charlie and Lee run through a file they were given of what they knew about the man they have just killed. Johnny was once a champion race car driver whose career ended in a violent crash.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @neillavin300 I did lol we had it on a cd before eurovision ended,  now that is sad. Fairytale -- Alexander Rybak.","output":"To describe the sentiment of this tweet, it is essential to break down its various components and context. The tweet consists of a user mentioning another user, along with comments about a particular song, \\"Fairytale,\\" by Alexander Rybak. The song in question became well-known after winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 2009. In general, the sentiment of this tweet is mixed, with both positive and negative aspects. The tweet can be dissected into different observations and feelings being expressed by the user like nostalgia, amusement, and a slight tinge of self-deprecation or embarrassment. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the tweet: 1. Nostalgia: The user mentions \\"we had it on a cd before eurovision ended.\\" This statement can be interpreted as a fond remembrance of listening to the song in the past and enjoying it before it even became popular. The sentiment here leans towards positive, as they imply that they liked the song enough to have it in their collection at that time. 2. Amusement: The user writes, \\"I did lol.\\" The abbreviation \\"lol\\" (laugh out loud) indicates that the user is amused or entertained by the experience of having listened to the song before it became well-known. This expression adds a light-hearted tone to the tweet, suggesting that the user is sharing a funny experience or story. 3. Self-deprecation/Embarrassment: The phrase \\"now that is sad\\" seems to allude to the idea that being such an early adopter of the song might be considered a bit ridiculous, or \\"sad.\\" The user appears to be poking fun at themselves or expressing mild embarrassment for having been so invested in the song at that time. This part of the sentiment can be characterized as negative, as it involves a critique of the user's own enthusiasm. 4. Appreciation for the song: Mentioning the song title \\"Fairytale\\" and the artist \\"Alexander Rybak\\" shows that the user appreciates and acknowledges the song and the artist, holding them in high regard. This aspect of the tweet is positive, as it demonstrates that the user is a fan of the song and the artist. Thus, the overall sentiment of the tweet is a blend of various emotions, with nostalgic undertones, amusement, appreciation for the song, and a hint of self-deprecation. The tone is primarily light-hearted and conversational, as the user shares a memory and personal reaction to the song and its origins in their life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. If you’re new to doing a 180 on your skateboard or haven’t done the trick in a while it’s a good idea to get your body used to being in the proper position. Practice skating around for a bit by pushing off and then situating your body into the right position. The ollie is the most fundamental skateboard trick and it’s incorporated into pretty much every trick you’ll do. And the 180 is an ollie where you turn your board and body 180-degrees. For the 180 you’ll be turning around either behind you for a backside 180, or in front of you for a frontside 180. Once you have the ollie down, you’re well on your way to doing a 180 skateboard trick!  If you ride “regular” you will have your right foot in the back positioned on the tail of the board. If you ride “goofy” then your left foot will be in back on the tail. You want to position your back foot on the tip of the tail. To do a 180 on the skateboard, you’ll want to position your back foot on the corner of the tail. For a straight ollie your front foot will be centered about halfway up the board or slightly back.  You also want to put more pressure on the outer edge of your foot (the side your pinky toe is on). To help you with turning, plant your front foot so its slightly hanging over the opposite edge of board from your back foot. This may feel awkward but it will help to keep your board balanced when you’re in the air. Your shoulders and your upper body is where most of the work will come from when you perform your 180.  By setting your shoulders correctly you will be able to turn your body quickly enough and this should allow your legs and the board to follow. You might be tempted to try and force the board to turn using mostly your legs, but you won’t get enough torque this way. For a backside 180, position your front shoulder slightly in front of your chest and dip it down so when you pull up you have more momentum to work with. For a frontside 180, you want to position back shoulder in front of your chest and dip it down as well so you can pull up and create momentum. You don’t want too much of a bend so that you end up crouching too low as that won’t allow you to pop high enough. You should stand with relaxed knees like you’re getting ready to hop slightly. If you are bending correctly you should be able to slide your front forward up the board with ease.

The case kept opening by itself because of the box kept in it because the","output":"box seemed to have some sort of powerful magnetic force emanating from it. Curiosity piqued, Alex decided to take a closer look at the peculiar object that had landed in their possession. Step 1: Secure the area. Alex reasoned that, with an unknown object exhibiting such unusual properties, it would be best to make sure there wouldn't be any major disruptions or accidents nearby. They carefully moved any metal objects or electronic devices out of the vicinity to minimize any unwanted interactions. Step 2: Investigate the object. With the area secured, Alex could now examine the box more closely, looking for any markings or symbols that might provide clues to its origin or purpose. They began taking photos of the box from all angles, making sure to capture any symbols or markings that could be important. Step 3: Research the symbols and markings. Alex uploaded the photos to their computer and began an online search for information on any of the symbols they'd found. They combed through historical databases and forums dedicated to arcane knowledge, trying to pinpoint any connections to cultures or time periods that might help reveal the box's true nature. Step 4: Consult an expert. When their initial research did not yield conclusive results, Alex decided to reach out to an expert in the field of ancient mysteries and unusual artifacts – Dr. Helena Vanstone. They sent Dr. Vanstone an email with the photos of the box attached, inquiring whether she had any insights into the mysterious item. Step 5: Awaiting the reply, Alex returned to the box. They observed the magnetic force again, attempting to determine if the box was activated by touch, or if it had any other sort of trigger mechanism. Alex wore gloves to avoid direct contact with the box and used a plastic tool to gently prod the surface to see if it caused any reaction. Step 6: Experiment with materials. Alex thought it useful to know if the box's powerful magnetic force would be negated by certain materials. This could help contain the box and prevent any further unintended effects. They tested different materials as a barrier, such as wood, plastic, and glass, to observe if any of them could diminish the magnetic force. Step 7: Reevaluate the situation. After conducting extensive research and experimenting with the box, Alex still had no concrete explanation for its existence or purpose. They decided to wait for Dr. Vanstone's response before making any decisions on how to proceed. Step 8: The reply from Dr. Vanstone finally arrived. Alex eagerly opened the email, hoping for some answers. Reading through the detailed message, they discovered that the box might have origins in a long-lost civilization known for advanced technology and a powerful magnetic energy source little was known about. Step 9: Collaboration with Dr. Vanstone. Considering the significance of this finding, Alex decided to collaborate with Dr. Vanstone to further investigate the box's properties and origin. They agreed to ship the box to Dr. Vanstone's lab securely, using a non-metallic containment unit to avoid potential accidents during transit. Step 10: Discovery and further research. As Dr. Vanstone's team conducted more tests and analyzed the data provided by Alex, they hoped to unlock the secrets of the mysterious magnetic box. They knew the journey to understanding the true nature of the artifact would be challenging, but with careful study and perseverance, they were confident that they would eventually uncover its secrets, possibly opening doors to an entirely new understanding of history and technologies from a lost civilization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Serpico Context: Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) covered in blood and slumped in the backseat of a police car as it races to a hospital with lights and sirens blaring. He has just been shot in the face. The rest of the movie tells the story of Serpico's career up to this moment, starting with him becoming a police officer in 1960. He is very idealistic and believes in non-brutal methods to catch criminals. Serpico also refuses to join in on police corruption, specifically that which involves shaking down and taking payoffs from gambling and drug dealing organizations. His refusal to take bribes earns him the suspicion of his fellow officers throughout the majority of the precincts to which he is assigned. Additionally, Serpico finds trouble fitting in due to his embrace of the counterculture of the 1960s: He moves to Greenwich Village, grows his hair and beard long to the point where he must maintain a plainclothes appearance, and associates with a more left-wing crowd that is distrusting of the NYPD.At first Serpico tries appealing to his bosses about the corruption, but gets nowhere. He enlists a highly-connected fellow officer, Bob Blair (Tony Roberts) in his fight against corruption, but not even he can crack the city administration's general indifference. His campaign and the resulting complications and harassment within the department take a toll on his mental health and his relationship with fiancee Laurie (Barbara Eda-Young), who ultimately leaves him. After meeting a sympathetic police inspector who agrees to assist him with both disrupting the gambling rackets and later calling attention to the problem by going to the New York Times, he is transferred to narcotics, as he has always wanted. However, he finds himself in an even more corrupt and hostile atmosphere than before, where he has mostly enemies and almost no allies due to the reputation he has garnered. As a result, he is shot in the face during a raid on a heroin lab due to his fellow officers' reluctance to come to his aid. After being left for dead and... The answer to this question is:","output":"A government inquiry into the NYPD refers to an official investigation conducted by a government agency or legislative body to examine the operations, policies, or corruption within the New York Police Department (NYPD).

A government inquiry involving the NYPD may involve examining instances of corruption, abuse of power, or similar issues and recommending reforms or actions to address these problems. In Serpico's case, his struggles led to the creation of the Knapp Commission, which was formed to investigate police corruption in New York City in the 1970s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But also a question for economists, argued Kenneth Boulding, a British economist, in an essay published in 1966. We have run our economies, he warned, like cowboys on the open grassland: taking and using the world's resources, confident that more lies over the horizon. But the Earth is less a grassland than a spaceship--a closed system, alone in space, carrying limited supplies. We need, said Boulding, an economics that takes seriously the idea of environmental limits. In the half century since his essay, a new movement has responded to his challenge. \\"Ecological economists\\", as they call themselves, want to revolutionise its aims and assumptions. What do they say--and will their ideas achieve lift-off? To its advocators, ecological economics is neither ecology nor economics, but a mix of both. Their starting point is to recognise that the human economy is part of the natural world. Our environment, they note, is both a source of resources and a sink for wastes. But it is ignored in conventional textbooks, where neat diagrams trace the flows between firms, households and the government as though nature did not exist. That is a mistake, say ecological economists. There are two ways our economies can grow, ecological economists point out: through technological change, or through more intensive use of resources. Only the former, they say, is worth having. They are suspicious of GDP, a crude measure which does not take account of resource exhaustion, unpaid work, and countless other factors. In its place they advocate moreholistic  approaches, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a composite index  that includes things like the cost of pollution, deforestation and car accidents. While GDP has kept growing, global GPI per person peaked in 1978: by destroying our environment we are making ourselves poorer, not richer.

Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present.  Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

Write the answer: \\"Who said \\"\\"the die is cast\\"\\" as he crossed the Rubicon?\\"","output":"\\"The die is cast\\" is a famous quote attributed to Julius Caesar, a Roman statesman, general, and one of the most well-known historical figures from ancient history. He reportedly said the phrase \\"Alea iacta est\\" (in Latin) as he crossed the Rubicon River, which, at the time, marked the northern boundary of Italy. This event occurred on January 10, 49 B.C. The phrase signifies an irrevocable decision or an action's point of no return. To provide some context, Julius Caesar was born in 100 B.C. into a patrician family. Although from a well-connected background, Caesar faced many challenges in his youth. He steadily rose to prominence through his talents as an orator, general, and politician. During the Gallic Wars from 58 B.C. to 50 B.C., Caesar expanded the Roman territories to include regions like Gaul and Britannia, amassing wealth and power in the process. However, his achievements also earned him adversaries within the ruling establishment in Rome. The First Triumvirate, formed by Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Marcus Licinius Crassus, was an informal alliance that allowed the three men to advance their political aspirations. With Crassus' death in 53 B.C. and the deteriorating personal relationship between Caesar and Pompey, the stage was set for a power struggle between these two prominent figures. The Roman Senate, worried about Caesar's growing influence, ordered him to disband his army and return to Rome. Refusing to comply, Caesar chose to cross the Rubicon River with his legions, initiating a civil war. By crossing the Rubicon River and disobeying the Senate's orders, Caesar committed an act of insubordination and treason that would lead to a series of critical events in the history of Rome. The civil war culminated in the defeat of Pompey's forces, ultimately paving the way for Caesar to become the dictator of Rome. Caesar's reign, though relatively brief, resulted in substantial political, social, and military reforms that shaped the future of the Roman Empire. To sum it up, Julius Caesar, one of ancient Rome's most iconic figures, exclaimed \\"the die is cast\\" as he crossed the Rubicon River—a bold and irreversible decision that altered the course of history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.  Paragraph: Dr. Jones studied 2 groups of people to see the effects of aging on humans. Group A had people under 35 years old in it, while group B had people over 65.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had an increased reflex time? Answer:","output":"Group B, consisting of individuals over 65 years old, experienced an increased reflex time compared to Group A. This increase in reflex time can be attributed to the various physiological changes that occur in the human body during late adulthood. As an individual grows older, their overall physical fitness, strength, and stamina tend to decline, which can inevitably affect their reflexes. Furthermore, the aging process can impair individuals' sensory faculties, potentially making it more challenging for them to react quickly to stimuli in their environment. These factors, combined with other age-related health risks such as weakened immune systems and the development of diseases like arthritis or Alzheimer's, contribute to the decline in reflex time typically observed in older adults, as seen in Group B of Dr. Jones' study."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” Researchers found that writers who don't time-block their writing in advance probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - Get all of their work done - Feel like they're stuck - Are more efficient than those that do time-block Answer:","output":"- Feel like they're stuck"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who designed geometric bowls and bronze vessels?\\" is \\"Homosapiens\\"?  1. no 2. yes","output":"The correct answer is 1. No. According to the passage, the geometric bowls and bronze vessels were designed by the Chinese during the Shang Dynasty, not by Homo sapiens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The president rode bikes with his family for a little less than an hour before breaking off to go play golf. Sasha did not accompany her family to. Martha's Vineyard when they left Washington, D.C. last Saturday. The. White House has said she'll be joining her family for part of their. two-week summer vacation, but she has yet to be seen. Reporters traveling with first family on vacation said the president spent just under half an hour biking with his wife and daughter before breaking away to hit the links. Obama is playing his fifth game of golf today since arriving on the island. He was joined today by 32 Advisors Founder and CEO Robert Wolf. Wolf is a hedge fund and money manager who served on Obama's now-defunct Jobs Council.

John William Carson (October 23, 1925 - January 23, 2005) was an American television host, comedian, writer, and producer. He is best known as the host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962-1992). Carson received six Emmy Awards, the Television Academy's 1980 Governor's Award, and a 1985 Peabody Award. He was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1987. On May 1, 1972, the show was moved from Thirty Rockefeller Plaza, New York, to Burbank, California, because of the studio's proximity to the celebrities. Carson often joked about \\"beautiful downtown Burbank\\" and referred to \\"beautiful downtown Bakersfield\\", which prompted Bakersfield Mayor Mary K. Shell to chide Carson and invite him to her city to see improvements made during the early 1980s.  From July 1971, Carson stopped hosting five shows per week. Instead, Mondays featured a guest host, leaving Carson to host the other four weeknights. Shows were videotaped in Burbank at 5:30 pm, fed from there to the Central and Eastern time zone stations via cross-country television line at 8:30 pm Pacific time (11:30 pm Eastern time), and later sent from Burbank to the Pacific time zone stations at 11:30 pm Pacific time. Since only two feeds originated from Burbank, Central time zone stations received the Eastern feed one hour earlier at 10:30 pm local time, and Mountain time stations received the Pacific time zone feed one hour later at 12:30 am local time.  In 1980, at Carson's request, the show cut its 90-minute format to 60 minutes on September 16; Tom Snyder's Tomorrow added a half-hour to fill the vacant time. Joan Rivers became the \\"permanent\\" guest host from September 1983 until 1986. The Tonight Show returned to using rotating guest hosts, including comic George Carlin. Jay Leno then became the exclusive guest host in fall 1987. Leno joked that although other guest hosts had upped their fees, he had kept his low, assuring himself more bookings. Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for The Best of Carson--rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s.  Although Carson's work schedule became more attenuated, Tonight remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s, he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about 4 million a year (15,008,000 today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses. He refused many offers to appear in films, including title roles in The Thomas Crown Affair and Gene Wilder's role in Blazing Saddles. He also declined director Martin Scorsese's offer to co-star with Robert De Niro in the 1983 film The King of Comedy, the role of a TV talk-show host then going to Jerry Lewis.  In recognition of his 25th anniversary on The Tonight Show, Carson received a personal Peabody Award, the board saying he had \\"become an American institution, a household word, [and] the most widely quoted American.\\" They also said they \\"felt the time had come to recognize the contributions that Johnny has made to television, to humor, and to America.\\"","output":"This text is about John William Carson, an American television host, comedian, writer, and producer who is best known as the host of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the English iterations of the franchise there is another type of Digi-Egg that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a Digimental (デジメンタル, Dejimentaru?) in Japanese. (This type of Digi-Egg was also featured as a major object throughout season 2 as a way of Digivolution available only to certain characters at certain points throughout the season.) They age via a process called \\"Digivolution\\" which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of intelligence and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. In some cases, as in the first series, the DigiDestined (known as the 'Chosen Children' in the original Japanese) had to find some special items such as crests and tags so the Digimon could digivolve into further stages of evolution known as Ultimate and Mega in the dub. Q: What effect does digivolution have on digimon?","output":"Digivolution (デジボルション, Dejiborushon), also known as \\"Digital Evolution\\" or \\"Digivolve,\\" is a core process in the Digimon world, which allows Digimon to change their appearance, increase their powers, and enhance their abilities. This transformative process is crucial for Digimon to adapt, grow, and compete in the Digital World. It is important to note that the effects of digivolution are not permanent, and upon completing a battle or when a Digimon becomes too weak, they often revert to their previous form. However, the experiences and growth they gain during their evolved state contribute to their overall development. When a Digimon digivolves, several changes occur: 1. Appearance: The most noticeable change is in the Digimon's physical appearance, as they transform into a new form that represents their next stage of development. This can include alterations in size, color, shape, and the presence of additional limbs or other features. 2. Power Level: As Digimon digivolve, their power levels increase, which makes them stronger, faster, and more resilient. This improved performance enables them to take on more formidable opponents and overcome greater challenges in the Digital World. 3. Abilities and Attacks: With digivolution comes the acquisition of new abilities and attacks, which serve to expand a Digimon's arsenal and give them more strategies to use in battle. These new abilities may include elemental powers, enhanced senses, or healing skills, among other things. 4. Intelligence and Communication Skills: Most Digimon are capable of intelligence and human speech, allowing them to communicate with their human partners and display a wide range of emotions. As a Digimon digivolves, their cognitive abilities may also develop further, enabling them to think more strategically in battle and interact more deeply with their human partners. 5. Affinity to Human Partners: Digivolution is often made possible through the strong bond between a Digimon and its human partner, facilitated by a device called a Digivice. As the Digimon digivolves, their connection with their human partner may continue to intensify, which can unlock additional forms and powers exclusive to that partnership. In conclusion, digivolution is a transformative process that allows Digimon to adapt to challenges, enhance their powers and abilities, and strengthen their bonds with their human partners. While the effects of digivolution are not permanent, the experience and growth gained during their evolved state contribute to the overall development of the Digimon."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Press the paper towel into the affected area to soak up as much of the wet paint as you can. This will minimize the severity of the stain it leaves behind. Work from the outside of the spot inward, folding the paper towel periodically to make sure you’re using a clean section.  Don’t wipe or scrub the spot, as this will only spread the paint around and enlarge the stain.  An absorbent towel will work even better for soaking up the wet paint. Dig out an old one, however, because it will likely be permanently stained afterwards. Add a few drops of a mild liquid dish soap to a container of warm water and stir. For best results, use a standard detergent or even hand soap—anything stronger may damage the leather.  Avoid soaps and detergents that are advertised as “extra strength” or contain “grease-fighting” agents. These typically contain harsh additives that can strip the color the color from dyed leather and cause cracking or splitting.  Soap and water will be useful for cleaning most water-based paints, including interior color and arts and crafts paint. Dip the brush into the soap solution, then shake off the excess water. Wet the paint spot and begin scrubbing it gently. After a few minutes, wipe the area with a clean towel and resume scrubbing. Repeat until the stain has been removed completely.  An old toothbrush or nylon dish scrubber will work well for this purpose. Use just enough force to coax out the stain. Otherwise, you may leave noticeable scratches or scuffs. Since leather is a natural material, it’s especially susceptible to water damage. You’ll want to make sure that you’ve dried the surface thoroughly once the paint is all gone. If you don’t, the residual moisture can cause the leather to crack, split or blister.  To dry leather safely and effectively, pat it with a microfiber towel or soft kitchen sponge. Consider treating the surface with a specialty conditioner. A good leather conditioner will enhance the color and texture of leather items while protecting them from spills and other accidents in the future.","output":"This article is about how to safely remove wet paint from leather by carefully soaking it up, gently scrubbing it with mild soap and water, then drying and conditioning the leather to prevent damage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

Which topic is this article about? Pick your answer from: (A). World; (B). Sports; (C). Business; (D). Science/Tech;","output":"The given article summary falls under the category of (D). Science/Tech. This article is about NASA's Cassini spacecraft making its first close approach to Titan, Saturn's largest moon, on October 25, 2004. To provide more detailed information, the Cassini mission is a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian Space Agency (ASI). Launched on October 15, 1997, the Cassini spacecraft, along with the Huygens probe, was sent to explore Saturn, its rings, and its myriad of moons. The mission is named in honor of the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who made numerous pioneering discoveries related to the Saturn system in the 17th century. The first close flyby of Titan by Cassini occurred on October 26, 2004, around three months after the spacecraft entered Saturn's orbit on July 1, 2004. Titan, with a diameter of about 5150 kilometers, is the second-largest moon in our solar system and is even larger than the planet Mercury. It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen and methane, with clouds of complex organic molecules and a possibility of a subsurface liquid water ocean. One of the main objectives of the Cassini mission was to study Titan's atmosphere, surface, and potential for supporting life. The flyby allowed the spacecraft to capture high-resolution images and gather data on the moon's atmospheric composition, weather patterns, and geological features. A few weeks after the initial flyby, on December 25, 2004, the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini orbiter and landed on Titan's surface on January 14, 2005, marking the first-ever landing on a moon in the outer solar system. Throughout its mission, Cassini conducted more than 120 flybys of Titan, providing invaluable information about this enigmatic moon and its potential to harbor life. The Cassini mission came to an end on September 15, 2017, when the spacecraft was deliberately plunged into Saturn's atmosphere, ending its two-decade-long journey and avoiding any potential contamination of the planet's moons. The mission revolutionized our understanding of the Saturnian system, leaving behind a rich scientific legacy that will continue to impact space exploration and research for decades to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead singer Ian Astbury's previous band Southern Death Cult. They gained a dedicated following in the UK in the mid-1980s as a post-punk/gothic rock band, with singles such as \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", before breaking mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as \\"Love Removal Machine\\" and \\"Fire Woman\\". According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the band fuse a \\"heavy metal revivalist\\" sound with the \\"pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors [and] the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock\\". Context: With the same line-up still in place, the band released The Cult in October 1994, produced by Bob Rock. The self-titled 'Cult' album is commonly referred to as the 'Black Sheep' album by fans of the group. Astbury referred to the record as \\"very personal and very revealing\\" songs about his life, with the subject matter ranging from sexual abuse at the age of 15, to the death of Nigel Preston, to his directionless years spent in Glasgow in the late 1970s.  The record achieved little success, only reaching No. 69 in the US and No. 21 in the UK. Duffy remarked that he thought that the record wouldn't sell well due to the offensive lyrics. The record went to number one in Portugal also, but quickly dropped out of sight. The single \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" was released with the band going on tour in support of the new album. Only one more single, \\"Star\\", was officially released with a live appearance on UK TV show The Word. \\"Star\\" began life in 1986 as \\"Tom Petty\\" and was recorded at the \\"Sonic Temple\\" demo sessions as \\"Starchild\\", being dropped by the band during rehearsals. In 1993 the song was resurrected and was finally completed for the record in 1994 as, just simply, \\"Star\\".  When the band began the Beauty's On The Streets tour in winter 1994, they augmented the line up with James Stevenson on rhythm guitar. As with the Ceremony record several years earlier, no other official singles were released, but several other songs were released on a strictly limited basis: \\"Sacred Life\\" was released in Spain and the Netherlands, \\"Be Free\\" was issued in Canada and France, \\"Saints Are Down\\" was issued in Greece, but none of the songs gained much commercial success. During this tour, the Cult made their first ever appearance in Norway. Question: Did it release world wide?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, the album called \\"The Cult\\" by the British rock band was released worldwide. But it didn't do very well in most places, only reaching number 69 in the US and number 21 in the UK. It did better in Portugal where it reached number 1, but it didn't stay popular for long. They released some singles from the album in different countries but didn't have much success with them either."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The pilot, Roger Peterson, also lost his life in the accident. Their deaths were a significant loss to the early rock 'n' roll world, and the phrase \\"The Day the Music Died\\" was later popularized by Don McLean's 1971 song \\"American Pie.\\" While this devastating event saw the untimely deaths of these three talented artists, several others in their entourage or related to them were not on the plane and survived. Some of the notable people who survived the day the music died include: 1. Waylon Jennings: Jennings was Buddy Holly's bass player and had been touring with him. Originally, he had a seat on the plane but gave it up to J.P. Richardson, who had the flu. This decision ultimately saved his life. Jennings went on to have a successful career as a country music artist. 2. Tommy Allsup: Allsup was a guitarist in Holly's band. He was supposed to be on the plane but, in an impromptu decision, lost his seat to Ritchie Valens in a coin toss. Following the tragedy, Allsup continued his career as a musician and producer. 3. Carl Bunch: The drummer for Holly's band, Bunch was hospitalized at the time with frostbite and thus was not on the plane. He later went on to work as a postal inspector but continued to play music throughout his life. 4. Dion DiMucci: Known as Dion, he was the frontman for \\"Dion and the Belmonts,\\" one of the prominent acts on the Winter Dance Party tour. Dion was offered a seat on the plane but refused due to the cost, which he felt was too expensive. He rose to fame in the 1960s with several solo hits and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. 5. Maria Elena Holly: Buddy Holly's pregnant wife at the time, Maria Elena, was not on the tour at all. After learning about her husband's tragic passing, she suffered a miscarriage due to the psychological trauma. Maria Elena never remarried, dedicating her life to promoting and preserving Buddy Holly's legacy. These individuals may have survived \\"The Day the Music Died,\\" but the impact of that fateful day was felt throughout the music industry and etched the names of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. \\"The Big Bopper\\" Richardson into the annals of rock 'n' roll history."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Find the form that suits what you are going to say. It could be a haiku or even a limerick. Be true, be forthright, and don’t get caught up in other people’s ideas of what being in love is like, or some inherited ideal of a love poem. Concentrate on the realities of the person that you are dealing with. Don’t disguise them as some kind of ideal – they are going to want to feel that’s my poem, that’s my expression, that’s what we did together. Here are my five rules: 1 Speak from your heart. Poets have in their toolbox every trick of rhetoric and linguistic structuring - from alliteration to zeugma. The toolbox is there to be ransacked, but the strength of your feelings might be diverted if you get too tied up with technical stuff. 2 Simply to say “I love you” or “you’re beautiful” is not interesting. Remember William Carlos Williams’ advice about writing - there is no truth but in things. So be particular. Things have a fascination that abstractions don’t. A reader will be more likely to identify with your poem if there are references to personal situations or particular features - be it their body, attitude or behaviour. 3 A sense of humour is not at odds with passionate intensity. Catching the ridiculousness of a situation doesn’t betray the subject or misrepresent the strength of your feelings. And don’t shy away from flaws. The whole business of being attracted to people is connected to their imperfections. 4 Pay attention to rhymes and rhythms and the sound your words make. The sound of the thing is as important as the dictionary definition of the words. 5 Revise, revise, revise. Our first thoughts are almost never our best. What was this article about?","output":"This article provides advice from poet Andrew Motion on how to write a love poem. He emphasizes the importance of finding a form that matches the message you want to convey and being true to the subject of your affection. Motion shares five rules for writing a love poem: 1. Speak from your heart: While it's essential to use poetic techniques, be careful not to let them distract from the genuine emotion you want to express. 2. Be specific: Avoid generic statements like \\"I love you\\" or \\"you're beautiful.\\" Instead, focus on the unique details of your love or the person that make your feelings special. 3. Embrace humor and flaws: A love poem should encompass the entirety of a relationship, including its imperfections and the humor that comes with it. 4. Consider the auditory aspect: Pay attention to the sound, rhyme, and rhythm of your words, as they can significantly impact how your poem is perceived. 5. Revise, revise, revise: Take time to refine your poem, as our first thoughts are rarely our best. By following these guidelines, you can craft a love poem that truly captures the essence of your feelings and your relationship with your beloved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Police say once they reached Weston, the thieves cut the GPS trackers used to monitor the trailers.      “They stole the whole trailer.

He says he saw them while they were still outside the store.      “When I came here Tuesday and saw them I was like, those things are too easy to disappear,” Welsh told CBS4’s Natalia Zea.      He says he didn’t see the trailers secured with a pin-lock designed to keep the trailers from being driven off…cargo and all.      Even if they were locked up though, he believes the cargo thieves would have succeeded with their plan.      “A lock just going to slow them down, if they knew what they’re doing, they’re desperate, they will take that right off.”      Welsh has had one of his trailers stolen in the past and stepped up security measures to guard against holiday time thieves, including 2 pint sized Jack Russell terriers with a ferocious warning bark, and a full camera system all the way around the truck.

In Greek mythology who slayed the Hydra of Lerna?","output":"In Greek mythology, the Hydra of Lerna, often referred to simply as the Lernaean Hydra or Hydra, was a monstrous serpent-like creature with multiple heads. The exact number of heads varies according to different accounts, but it often ranges from five to nine or even more. The creature was said to have the ability to regenerate its heads when they were severed, with two new heads replacing each head that was cut off. The Hydra was also poisonous, with a deadly venom that could kill humans and animals from a single bite or even from its breath. The slayer of the Hydra of Lerna was the Greek hero Heracles, who is more commonly known by his Roman name Hercules. The feat of killing the Hydra was one of the Twelve Labors that Heracles was ordered to perform by his cousin, King Eurystheus of Tiryns. These tasks were a form of penance and purification for the hero after he was driven mad by the goddess Hera and killed his wife and children in a fit of frenzy. The Twelve Labors were supposed to be impossible tasks, but Heracles managed to complete each one with his incredible strength, resourcefulness, and intelligence. To slay the Hydra, Heracles traveled to the marshes of Lerna, the creature's abode. Upon arriving, Heracles began the battle against the monstrous serpent by attempting to sever its heads using a sickle, club, or sword, depending on the version of the story. However, each time a head was cut off, two new heads would grow back in its place. Frustrated by the monster's seemingly indestructible nature, Heracles sought the help of his nephew Iolaus, who accompanied him on his journey to Lerna. The duo came up with a clever plan to put an end to the Hydra's regenerative abilities. Each time Heracles cut off one of the Hydra's heads, Iolaus used a burning torch, firebrand, or red-hot iron to cauterize the neck wounds, effectively preventing new heads from regrowing. Despite their success with this strategy, Heracles faced other challenges during his battle against the Hydra. According to some accounts, the monster had one immortal head that could not be killed by conventional means. To overcome this obstacle, Heracles severed the immortal head and buried it beneath a heavy rock. In another version of the story, the goddess Hera, who harbored a long-standing grudge against Heracles, sent a giant crab called Carcinus to aid the Hydra in its fight. In response, the hero crushed the crab underfoot and continued his struggle with the multi-headed beast. Finally, after a long and fierce battle, Heracles succeeded in slaying the Hydra of Lerna. The hero then dipped his arrows in the creature's poisonous blood, a decision that would later have significant consequences in both his own life and the wider Greek mythological world. By overcoming the seemingly insurmountable challenge of defeating the Hydra, Heracles further elevated his status as a legendary hero and cemented his reputation for strength, cunning, and determination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Former Houston Texan Star Mario Williams Involved in Legal Battle Over 785,000 Diamond Ring  Introduction:   Former Houston Texans defensive end, Mario Williams, is currently embroiled in a legal dispute with his ex-fiancee, Erin Marzouki, over the return of an expensive engagement ring. The ring, valued at 785,000, has become the center of a heated lawsuit wherein both parties are levying accusations against one another. Background on the Dispute: According to reports, Mario Williams is suing his ex-fiancee Erin Marzouki in an effort to reclaim the diamond engagement ring, alleging that she used him to acquire financial support and never intended to wed. In a surprising turn of events, Marzouki is now counter-suing Williams, accusing him of filing the lawsuit for the primary purpose of harassing her. Marzouki's Counterclaim: Erin Marzouki's legal team has pushed back against Williams' claims, stating that the former NFL star had, in fact, terminated their engagement multiple times but never requested the return of the ring. It remains unclear whether Williams' previous reluctance to ask for the ring back will significantly impact the outcome of the lawsuit. Williams' Allegations: Mario Williams' representation asserts that his ex-fiancee took advantage of his income and never had any real intentions of marrying him. They argue that her actions constitute fraud and necessitate the return of the pricey engagement ring. Legal Implications and Public Interest: As the legal battle between Mario Williams and Erin Marzouki intensifies, the public gaze has been drawn to the details of the case. The high-profile nature of the case combined with the unique circumstances surrounding their engagement and allegations on both sides adds an extra layer of intrigue to the proceedings. Conclusion: With both Mario Williams and Erin Marzouki standing their ground and firmly contesting the allegations against them, the resolution of this lawsuit promises to be far from straightforward. The upcoming legal proceedings will ultimately determine the fate of the 785,000 diamond engagement ring and, potentially, shed further light on the nature of their relationship and its eventual dissolution"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Carlos Tevez scored twice as Argentina beat Mexico 3-1 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to set up a meeting with Germany in the quarterfinals of the World Cup. The Manchester City striker opened the scoring after 25 minutes in controversial fashion when television replays, which were relayed on the giant screens in the stadium, showed he was offside when he received the ball from Lionel Messi and headed into the net. Despite protests from the Mexican players, the goal was allowed to stand. Argentina doubled its lead when Gonzalo Higuain rounded goalkeeper Oscar Perez to score his fourth goal of the tournament. Tevez made certain of the victory with a stunning long-range strike into the top corner early in the second half. Javier Hernandez pulled a goal back for Mexico with a powerful left-footed drive after 70 minutes, but it proved to be little more than a consolation for the Mexicans as Argentina easily claimed the victory. Manager Diego Maradona's men almost scored a fourth goal when Perez had to dive to his right in stoppage-time to tip Messi's shot over the bar. Mexico, who has now gone out in the last 16 at five World Cups in a row, may feel the result could have been different without the error from the officials. After seeing the error on the big screens, Mexican players surrounded the referee and his assistant but the officials decided not to revoke the goal.

The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.

Moscow says its first warplanes to take off from its aircraft carrier now stationed off  the Syrian coast did not target Aleppo itself. But Russia's intensifying intervention could be a game changer in the protracted battle to control this strategic city and the momentum in this brutal war. The timing was expected: in a few months time a new President, with a new Syria policy, takes over in Washington. It was Russia's sudden decision in September 2015 to intervene militarily in Syria which marked the start of a decisive shift in the course of a brutal war which has come to define Syria. When we asked BBC News online readers what they wanted to know about Aleppo, the most popular question asked was, \\"Why is Russia helping the Assad regime?\\". Moscow has long-standing links to Syria, with many Syrian military officers trained and equipped by their Russian friends. But its decision to significantly boost its military, political, and moral support to Damascus did nothing less than rescue depleted Syrian forces from collapse on significant front lines under grinding pressure from an array of opposition forces. On a visit to Damascus shortly after Russia entered the fray, Syrian soldiers and officials hailed their strong cultural affinity with the Russians, as well as their gratitude in their hour of need. Air strikes resume on rebel-held Aleppo Why are people still living in east Aleppo? Life under siege in rebel-held Aleppo Why Assad wants to take Aleppo Aleppo: Key battleground in Syria's war Russian officials often say their intervention \\"stopped the black flags\\" of so-called Islamic State (IS) from being raised in the Syrian capital. The threat posed by Islamic extremists is very real. But strengthening President Assad was a winning move for Moscow on many fronts. It transformed Russia from a minor actor on the Syrian stage to the lead player which continues to resonate across the region. American officials warned a year ago that Russia's gambit would suck it into another Afghanistan quagmire which ended in humiliating and costly defeat during the Cold War. But even Arab allies of the Syrian opposition have at times privately expressed admiration for President Vladimir Putin's muscular backing for an ally, at so far limited cost. Russia's assets in Syria centre on its port at Tartus, its only seaport along the Mediterranean, as well as its newly established Khmeimim air base in the north-west, its only airfield in the Middle East. We asked readers to send in their questions about what is happening in Aleppo. Lyse chose four questions, and we asked you to select your favourite which was: \\"Why is Russia helping the Assad regime?\\" Take a look at some of the other questions you've wanted us to answer In October, Russia's parliament ratified an open-ended agreement to approve the base which revealed what had been a secret pact a year earlier to give Russia carte blanche to move personnel and cargo in and out of Syria, without inspection or interruption by Syrian authorities. Over the past year more troops and considerable firepower, including advanced missile systems, have been moved onto the battlefield. Russian media have also reported the presence of Russian special forces as well as thousands of Russians working for military companies. Russia and its Syrian ally cast their alliance as the winning team in the fight against IS. The capture of the ancient city of Palmyra last March - where Russia has now established a military post - is proof of that. But Western militaries and diplomats repeatedly accuse Moscow of targeting opposition groups backed by the West, as well as attacking schools and hospitals which put civilians in harm's way. Accusations of possible war crimes are now a constant refrain. For Russia, this new projection of military power is about more than just Syria. It's one axis in a broader geopolitical battle to take what it sees as its rightful place at the world's top tables, on equal par with the power and prestige of the United States. Endless talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry about finding a negotiated way out in Syria masked the quest for another prize - military to military co-operation, including intelligence sharing, which the Pentagon balks at. For Russia, the redrawing of the map stretches to Ukraine and beyond in Moscow's new Cold War tensions with Nato nations. Russia and Iran are on the same side in this war, along with Lebanese Hezbollah forces, and a dizzying array of  fighters from far and wide including Iraqis and Afghans. Iran's interests are different but no less essential: preserving its land corridor and access to Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon, protecting Shia shrines, and consolidating its growing geopolitical sway across the region at the expense of powerful Sunni rivals such as Saudi Arabia. Both Iran and Russia have the back as well as the ear of President Assad, but not his complete acquiescence. The Syrian leader has long been a shrewd operator when it comes to playing his foreign friends off each other. When President Putin suddenly announced last March that he was pulling out \\"the main part\\" of Russian forces in Syria, talk in Damascus immediately turned to how Iran would fill any vacuum. There has long been intense speculation over whether President Assad's most crucial allies would eventually try to nudge him aside for another less controversial strong man. But they continue to insist the Syrian leader still commands popular support. For now, it suits them to keep him in charge. And now US President-elect Donald Trump looks set to join this axis, at least in the fight against IS and the group once known as the Nusra Front which has been linked to al-Qaeda. President Assad has already called Mr Trump a \\"natural ally\\". President Putin gambled last year when he entered Syria's great game. Western leaders often say he played a weak hand, and admit he's played it well - at least where it matters to him, and his allies.

(December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Pardes is a story that revolves around Arjun (Shah Rukh Khan) and Ganga (Mahima Chaudhary). Kishorilal (Amrish Puri), a wealthy Indian businessman living in America, visits his old friend Suraj Dev (Alok Nath) in India. During his stay at the conservative, traditional Indian household, he gets to know Suraj's eldest daughter, Ganga, who shares his love for India and Indian culture. Ganga's younger siblings are enchanted by the uncle from America, and because they perceive Western culture and values to be so desirable, they cook up a plan to impress him with an English song. Unimpressed, he sings back a hymn-like song in a more traditional Indian style, \\"I love my India.\\" Ganga joins in this song, expressing her equal love for India. The song emphasises the movie's theme in key moments. Kishorilal asks Suraj to promise Ganga as a bride for his westernised son, Rajiv (Apoorva Agnihotri). He is convinced that Ganga will be not only a perfect bride, but the way treasured Indian values are revived and passed on in his Americanized family and large circle of Indian friends and business acquaintances. Suraj's family accepts the proposal. Kishorilal knows he will have a tough time trying to convince his son to marry or even meet Ganga. Back in America, he asks his foster son, Arjun (Shahrukh Khan) to help his plan along. Arjun, who has been working in Kishorilal's personal garage and making music with his band, is being interviewed as the composer of the new musical hit \\"I Love My India\\". However, when Kishorilal calls to ask for his help, his loyalty to his uncle is so strong that he cuts the interview short.

Context: Abnormalities of lung coagulation and fibrinolysis in sarcoidosis are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.', 'We previously showed that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) D dimer directly correlated with various measures of severity in sarcoidosis. Here, we analyze our observation that BALF D dimer was more frequently found at higher levels in African-American patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.', 'BALF D dimer was measured in 55 subjects with pulmonary sarcoidosis and 31 healthy volunteers by enzyme immunoassay. The healthy group established a normal range of BALF D dimer with 71 ng/ml as the highest measured level. This was the cut point for comparisons among the patients with sarcoidosis.', 'High BALF D dimer levels (>71 ng/ml) were found in younger patients with sarcoidosis and were associated with a significantly lower percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s and greater numbers of BAL lymphocytes. Black patients with sarcoidosis had higher BALF D dimer levels (median 131, range 0-2,040 ng/ml) than white patients (median 18, range 0-605 ng/ml; p = 0.011). Higher than normal BALF D dimer levels were found in 61% of the black subjects with sarcoidosis, but in only 20% of the white individuals (chi(2) = 5.539, p = 0.019). BALF D dimer was the only disease measure that discriminated black from white individuals with sarcoidosis. Answer: BALF D dimer is an indicator of lung fibrin formation and degradation in sarcoidosis. The relationship of high D dimer levels with greater BAL lymphocytosis and worse lung function may be a marker of active sarcoidosis, especially in African-Americans who tend to suffer a more serious form of the disease.

In fact, the paragraph suggests the opposite. The passage mentions that \\"mold can sometimes creep in where you least expect or want it to, all around the home.” This statement indicates that mold can grow and spread in various places where it is not desired or expected. Furthermore, the paragraph highlights that mold comes in different colors, such as green, pink, and black, which can be alarming and potentially pose health concerns. Mold growth is typically a result of excess moisture or humidity, and it can thrive in hidden or poorly ventilated areas, such as kitchens, bathrooms, or basements. The presence of mold can not only affect the appearance of your surroundings but also cause unpleasant odors and lead to potential health problems, particularly for individuals who are sensitive to mold or suffer from allergies and respiratory issues. To maintain a fresh and environmentally sound home, it is essential to take preventive measures against mold growth. Some effective strategies include controlling the moisture level in your house, ensuring proper ventilation, and regularly cleaning and inspecting vulnerable areas. By adopting such practices, one can reduce the risk of mold growth and create a healthier living environment. In summary, the paragraph suggests that mold is not only found where you want it, but it can also appear in unwanted and unexpected places in your home.

He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts. He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck, and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs. He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior. One day, Melvin's apartment neighbor, a gay artist named Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery. Melvin is intimidated by Simon's agent, Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), into caring for Simon's dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it. He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol.

Context: I had seen it before, those fuzzy, furry leaves and stalks, with the pretty, star-pointed purple flowers, but up until that moment that I saw them sitting in a basket at the market stalls, I admit I had never taken notice of it as a food. It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones. Or you can simply deep fry the clusters of buds that haven’t yet burst open like these deep-fried robinia flowers. borage and ricotta crepes The problem, I was thinking, as I took home my bag of borage, is that I can’t decide what to make. There’s simply too much choice. I consulted two of my favourite books that also happen to be cookbooks. Patience Gray’s Honey from a Weed and Luigi Ballerini’s A Feast of Weeds. Both had wonderful ideas for borage (and indeed many other edible, foraged plants). Question: Who bought the flowers?

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The story takes place in the fertile, eastern lands bordered by the Mediterranean Sea and kept by the gods. Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built, wars fought, alliances forged, and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox), king of Mycenae, has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly, hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles, but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill, Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon, preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius, sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation, and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However, young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus' beautiful wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy, stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone, Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother, Agamemnon, who is only too happy to oblige, though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean), king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon, goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the...

Continue writing the following text. Sarah learned how to ride a skateboard recently and wanted Megan to learn also, so","output":"they could skate together and explore the city on their boards. Megan, who was always up for trying something new, decided to give it a shot even though she had never been on a skateboard before. Sarah was excited to share her newfound passion with her best friend, and they planned a day at the local park to get started. The day finally came, and Sarah brought along her own skateboard as well as a spare one she borrowed from her older brother, just for Megan. Before they started, Sarah thought it was essential to go over the basic safety rules and equipment. She emphasized the importance of wearing a helmet, knee and elbow pads, and proper footwear to minimize the risk of injury. Once Megan was all geared up, they found a flat, open area in the park to practice. The first thing Sarah taught Megan was how to stand on a skateboard correctly. She showed her how to align her feet with the width of her shoulders, placing her front foot just behind the front trucks and her back foot over the rear trucks. They practiced their stance for a few minutes, adjusting their feet and maintaining balance. Next, Sarah demonstrated the correct way to push off on a skateboard. Megan watched as Sarah started with her back foot on the tail of the board, pushed off with her front foot, and then placed it back on the board to balance. Megan tried it a few times and, after a few shaky starts, she began to get the hang of it. Sarah then explained how to steer the skateboard. \\"Leaning is the key,\\" she said. \\"If you want to go left, just lean to the left. The same goes for the right. If you shift your weight, the trucks and wheels will follow.\\" Megan followed Sarah's instructions and gradually started to steer with more confidence. Working on their balance, Sarah suggested practicing bending their knees while riding. This helped Megan maintain her balance on the board and absorb bumps or uneven surfaces they encountered. They practiced for a while, gradually increasing their speed, and Megan began to feel more comfortable on the skateboard. As Megan's confidence grew, Sarah decided it was time to learn some basic tricks. They started with a manual, which is balancing on the rear wheels while keeping the nose of the skateboard off the ground. After several attempts, Megan managed to pull off a short manual, much to her delight. Seeing Megan's progress, Sarah decided to show her how to do an ollie, a basic trick that involves jumping with the skateboard. Sarah demonstrated the process of sliding her front foot forward while pulling up on the back end of the board to lift it into the air. Megan found this trick a bit trickier than the manual but was determined to learn it. After many attempts and a few falls, Megan finally landed her first ollie. As the sun began to set, Sarah and Megan decided to call it a day, both exhilarated by their progress and the fun they had skateboarding together. They made a pact to meet regularly to practice their newfound skills and explore new skate spots around the city. Weeks went by, and the two friends continued practicing and learning new tricks together, gradually getting better and more confident on their boards. They even started joining other skateboarders at the local skatepark, learning from more experienced riders and making new friends within the skateboarding community. Sarah was proud to see Megan develop into a skilled skateboarder, and they both cherished the bonding experience. As they cruised together through city sidewalks and empty parking lots, they felt the freedom of the wind in their hair and the joy of sharing a passion that would forever connect them as friends."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

However independent you are,it is good to have a roommate during your first year. Living with someone helps ease your loneliness. Sure it may seem appealing to be able to play your music and turn up your TV as loud as you want, but coming home to an empty room every day can be depressing. If you have a bad day, you may want to talk to someone. Friends are great sources of venting  , but friends can't always be there. Even worse, they may be selfcentered and show no interest in your problem. It's not that roommates aren't like this, but even just small talk can help you feel better. Having a roommate teaches you how to get along with people and settle conflict. You two should set up rules immediately and discuss what to do when there is conflict. If you two don't like each other,you still study,relax,and sleep in the same room. You must find a way to get along. Finally,having a roommate exposes   you to different ways of living. Your roommate may come from a different city,and have different living habits. He or she also has different interests and personalities. You don't have to end up liking the same things your roommate does,but try to learn something different.

Beer was priced from 12.00 to 14.00. Twitter users, including sportscasters, blasted the astonishingly high prices on their pages. Article:","output":"Title: Skyrocketing Concession Prices at MetLife Stadium Leave Fans and Sportscasters Outraged MetLife Stadium, the sprawling state-of-the-art facility in New Jersey known for hosting NFL events and world-class concerts, recently came under fire for its soaring concession prices. Fans attending various events at the stadium, including football games and live performances, have been left aghast at the eye-watering cost of food and beverages, with some items reaching staggering highs of 20.00. Twitter users, including influential sportscasters, subsequently took to the social media platform to express their disdain. One of the most notable examples of exorbitant pricing at the stadium was hot chocolate, served in a souvenir mug. Costing an astounding 20.00, fans were left incredulous at the mammoth difference that the souvenir mug made to the overall price; without the mug, the hot chocolate's cost stood at a still alarming 11.00. The considerable markup on a seemingly simple beverage fueled widespread backlash from event-goers. Additionally, the price of beer at MetLife Stadium skyrocketed, ranging from 12.00 to 14.00. The surge begged the question: have concession prices reached a tipping point? Fans accustomed to inflated prices at sporting events and concerts were still left reeling at the spike, as many had never encountered costs this high for a standard concession item. In response to the mounting criticism, several sportscasters joined the discussion, lambasting the concession prices on their Twitter accounts. The added exposure from these influential figures only served to stimulate further backlash, as their followers echoed their disgruntlement and astonishment at the levies. The situation has since escalated from isolated complaints to a full-fledged debate on the affordability and accessibility of attending live events. While it's common knowledge that food and drink at stadiums or arenas often come with substantial markups to cover the associated costs, the staggering prices at MetLife Stadium certainly raise concerns about the ethics behind such profit margins. Critics argue that such price hikes not only alienate fans but also tarnish the overall experience of attending events at these venues. This incident has opened up a wider dialogue on the pricing strategy employed by stadiums and concert venues, with many questioning the value of attending events at these settings. Balancing the responsibility of covering operational costs while providing an enjoyable environment for fans emerges as a crucial consideration for venue management.  In conclusion, the controversy surrounding the concession prices at MetLife Stadium has undeniably highlighted how the accessibility of live events can be compromised by unreasonable price hikes. Reaffirming the need to strike a balance between economic considerations and fan satisfaction, venue owners and operators must take stock of the weight this issue holds on their customer base that, if left unaddressed, may lead to long-term damage to their brand and reputation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a question about the following article: During the 1920s, specifically In 1928, the components of the Dow were increased to 30 stocks near the economic height of that decade, which was nicknamed the Roaring Twenties. This period downplayed the influence of an early Depression of 1920–21 plus certain international conflicts such as the Polish-Soviet war, the Irish Civil War, the Turkish War of Independence and the initial phase of the Chinese Civil War. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression over the next several years returned the average to its starting point, almost 90% below its peak. By July 8, 1932, following its intra-day low of 40.56, the Dow would end up closing the session at 41.22. The high of 381.17 on September 3, 1929, would not be surpassed until 1954, in inflation-adjusted numbers. However, the bottom of the 1929 Crash came just 2½ months later on November 13, 1929, when intra-day it was at the 195.35 level, closing slightly higher at 198.69. For the decade, the Dow would end off with a healthy 131.7% gain, from 107.23 points at the beginning of 1920, to a level of 248.48 points at the end of 1929, just before the Crash of 1929.

Make this lower case.","output":"one very effective and productive procedure that they developed was to use the bulldozers in teams of three rather than having them work separately. This approach of utilizing the bulldozers in teams has demonstrated various benefits in terms of efficiency, coordination, and overall productivity. By working collaboratively in teams of three, these heavy machinery units can tackle more significant obstacles and challenges than they would if they were to operate individually. This teamwork-oriented method has proven itself to be an innovative and advantageous approach in the construction and excavation industry. Some of the key benefits of having the bulldozers work in teams of three include: 1. Improved efficiency: Working in teams enables the bulldozers to increase their speed and accomplish tasks with greater precision. The synchronization of their movements results in better allocation of resources and time, leading to quicker project completion. 2. Enhanced communication: When bulldozers work in teams, operators can effectively communicate with each other to ensure that they're working in harmony. This clear communication helps to prevent any misunderstandings or errors that might arise if the bulldozers were working independently. 3. Streamlined processes: Teams of bulldozers can systematically break down tasks to streamline work processes, making the overall project more efficient. This reduces the chances of delays and bottlenecks, ensuring the project runs smoothly and stays on schedule. 4. Mutual support: When bulldozers operate in teams, they can provide crucial backup support for each other in challenging situations. This mutual assistance can help increase overall safety, prevent accidents, and limit the potential for damage to equipment and construction sites. 5. Task specialization: Within a team of bulldozers, each unit can be assigned specific roles based on its strengths and capabilities. By focusing on their areas of expertise, the bulldozers can perform optimally, contributing their unique skills to enhance the team's overall performance. 6. Reduced downtime: In case one bulldozer encounters a malfunction or requires maintenance, the team can continue working with the remaining units, reducing the negative impact of downtime on the project. 7. Shared learning: When bulldozers work together in a team, the operators have the opportunity to learn from each other's experiences and expertise. This shared learning fosters an environment of continuous improvement, ensuring optimal performance and overcoming obstacles more effectively. In conclusion, employing bulldozers in teams of three rather than having them work separately has yielded numerous advantages in terms of efficiency, communication, and mutual support. By embracing a teamwork-oriented approach, construction and excavation projects can reap the benefits of improved productivity and reduced timeframes, making this a key strategy for continued success in the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Other drugs on the market, approved to treat mild to moderate Alzheimer's, are believed to work by inhibiting cholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine which is a chemical used by nerves to communicate with each other. Can we infer the following? Inhibiting cholinesterase can help nerves communicate with each other","output":"Yes, we can infer that inhibiting cholinesterase can help nerves communicate with each other in the context of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. By understanding the mechanism and role of cholinesterase inhibitors, we can see how these drugs have the potential to improve communication between nerve cells, which is typically affected in Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and behavioral changes. One of the major changes observed in AD brains is a decrease in the function of neurotransmitter systems, including the cholinergic system. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter that plays essential roles in several brain functions such as learning, memory, and attention. In AD, the cholinergic system is impaired due to the loss of cholinergic neurons, which results in reduced acetylcholine levels. Cholinesterase, which includes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), is an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft (the space between two neurons). When acetylcholine is broken down, its signal is terminated, and the communication between neurons stops. Under normal conditions, this process is tightly regulated. However, in Alzheimer's disease, as the number of cholinergic neurons decreases and the production of acetylcholine becomes insufficient, the communications between neurons are further weakened. In this scenario, the use of cholinesterase inhibitors can provide a therapeutic benefit. By inhibiting the activity of cholinesterase enzymes, these drugs effectively slow down the breakdown of acetylcholine. This results in an increase in the concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, allowing for improved communication between neurons. Currently, there are several cholinesterase inhibitors approved for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. Clinical trials have shown that these drugs can help improve cognitive function and slow down the progression of the disease to some extent. However, it's important to note that cholinesterase inhibitors are not a cure for Alzheimer's, but rather a means to manage some of its symptoms. In conclusion, inhibiting cholinesterase can help nerves communicate with each other in the context of mild to moderate Alzheimer's, where the cholinergic system is impaired and the communication between neurons is compromised. Cholinesterase inhibitors work by slowing down the enzymatic breakdown of acetylcholine, increasing its availability in the synaptic cleft and subsequently enhancing neuronal communication. While these drugs can provide symptomatic improvements in cognitive function, they are not a definitive cure for Alzheimer's disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Joseph welcomed him inside, his charismatic smile beaming as he shook Kevin's hand and beckoned him into his living room. \\"Kevin, it's so good to see you! I'm thrilled you've finally decided to come over,\\" Joseph expressed, leading him towards a large, leather couch. \\"I promise you won't regret this.\\" Joseph's house was updated, modern, and elegant. The white walls were adorned with minimalist paintings, each piece projecting an aura of tranquility that seemed to mirror Joseph's personality. As Kevin sank into the leather, he could not help but feel a sense of calm wash over him. Joseph perched on the adjacent armchair and began his discussion with a few questions about Kevin's current skincare routine, his diet, and his overall lifestyle habits. As Kevin provided detailed descriptions, Joseph's face reflected thoughtful consideration. After hearing Kevin out, Joseph leaned forward and said: \\"First, let me share a valuable piece of advice with you: there is no one-size-fits-all answer to skincare, as each person's skin is unique. However, there are certain cornerstone principles that can help you tailor your routine to achieve the best possible results.\\" Joseph then proceeded to shed light onto his own skincare regimen, starting with the importance of a consistent routine. He pointed out that by diligently sticking to his twice-daily cleansing, moisturizing, and applying sunscreen, he had been able to dramatically improve his skin's overall health. Joseph also stressed the importance of being patient and gentle with your skin, advising Kevin to avoid picking or scratching at it as this could lead to scarring. When the conversation turned to diet, Joseph revealed that he paid special attention to the nutrients he consumed and the effect they had on his skin. He followed a balanced diet consisting of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Most notably, Joseph attributed his flawless complexion to his diligent water intake, hydrating his skin from within. Discussing lifestyle choices, Joseph advised Kevin on the importance of getting proper rest, as sleep played a critical role in the skin's natural rejuvenation and repair processes. Additionally, Joseph shared his dedication to exercise, stating that regular physical activity increased blood circulation, which subsequently helped nourish skin cells and cleanse them from the inside. As much as these personal tips and tricks were enlightening, Joseph knew it was essential that Kevin see a dermatologist to get a professional diagnosis and personalized treatment plan for his specific skin conditions. He recommended an esteemed doctor in their city and assured Kevin that the combination of his own guidance and the doctor's expert opinion would eventually lead him to healthy, vibrant skin. As Kevin left Joseph's house that evening, he felt a renewed sense of hope. He realized that achieving his desired complexion would require patience, discipline, and active engagement in his skincare journey. And as he turned towards his reflection, he saw the beginning of a promising transformation, one that would be reflected not just on his skin, but in the newfound confidence that he would soon begin to experience from within."},{"instruction":"Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't.  Which country will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas?  Hint: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.  With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] Answer:","output":"Niger will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas. This is because their focus on developing infrastructure and communications technology reduces the effects of distance decay. By improving connectivity and communication, the country can foster increased cultural and economic interactions, both within its borders and with other countries.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: Who saves the drifter from the real Lyle in the graveyard? , can you please find it?   Michael Williams is a drifter living out of his car after being discharged from the Marine Corps. A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne mistakes him for a hit man, \\"Lyle from Dallas\\", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash—\\"half now, half later\\"—and Michael plays along by taking the money. Michael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real Lyle from Dallas. Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her. The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Wayne's neck. Michael and Lyle fight, with Lyle ending up being impaled on a grave marker. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead. Michael and Suzanne escape onto a nearby train, but when Suzanne tries to betray Michael, he throws the money out of the speeding train and then throws Suzanne off to be arrested by the police accompanied by a wounded Wayne. Michael's train continues its journey into a new town. A:","output":"In the article, it is mentioned that Michael and Lyle engage in a fight at a remote graveyard.

The film opens with the mirroring of a gloomy sky on the placid Baltic Sea waters at the Faro Island shores, near Gotland's northernmost tip. Four bathers, all in a jovial mood, splashing and joking, are returning from a swim in the cold sea. As they reach the jetty, the youngest members of the quartet, Karin (Harriet Andersson) and her teenage brother, Fredrik, known as Minus (Lars Passgard), are sent off to get some milk at a nearby farm, while Karin's physician husband, Martin (Max von Sydow), and her father, David (Gunnar Bjorstrand), a writer, go and set up their fishing nets. David has just returned from Switzerland, where he was finishing writing his latest novel, and their task gives them a private opportunity to discuss Karin's status, whose schizophrenia has been diagnosed as most likely incurable.On the way to the farm, Minus expresses his hope that their father will be successful with his latest novel's publication. On the way back, Minus confides in his sister his sexual apprehensions, which eventually degenerates into his admonishment of Karin for the (maybe) too intimate attention she keeps showing toward him. But most importantly, he confesses how much he wishes he could communicate with his father.The quartet is reunited for the evening dinner around a table in front of their cottage.

The girl had to go to the mental hospital while the boy didn't because the","output":"girl had been struggling with severe mental health issues for quite some time, while the boy seemed to be coping reasonably well with the stresses and challenges in his life. As the girl's mental state continued to deteriorate, her behavior became increasingly erratic and dangerous, both to herself and to those around her. Her parents, fearing for her safety and well-being, finally made the difficult decision to have her admitted to the mental hospital. The boy, on the other hand, had a strong support system in place and was able to find ways to work through his problems without resorting to self-destructive behaviors or becoming a danger to himself or others. Despite the challenges they both faced, the boy's resilience and the reliable network of friends, family, and professional support he had access to meant that in this case, the boy didn't need to go to the mental hospital the same way the girl did. At the mental hospital, the girl underwent a full psychological and medical evaluation by a team of dedicated mental health professionals. They diagnosed her with a combination of disorders, including major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder. These disorders severely impacted her ability to function in everyday life, engage in healthy interpersonal relationships and make well-balanced decisions. After the diagnosis, the girl began a comprehensive treatment program specifically tailored to her unique needs. This involved a combination of evidence-based treatments like individual psychotherapy, group therapy, and medication management, as well as adjunct therapies such as art therapy and mindfulness-based interventions. The girl’s treatment team worked closely with her and her family to develop an understanding of her disorders, establish treatment goals, and implement a plan for recovery while simultaneously providing constant support, guidance, and encouragement. Throughout her stay at the mental hospital, the girl learned valuable coping skills and tools to help her navigate through her emotional struggles and develop a more adaptive way of handling her thoughts and emotions. As she progressed through her treatment, she gradually began to gain a better understanding of herself and her mental health issues, and started to regain control over her life. Meanwhile, the boy continued to face his own challenges but managed to keep moving forward, thanks to his support system and the coping strategies he had developed. He made a conscious effort to educate himself about mental health in an attempt to understand the girl’s situation better and empathize with her struggles. Between school, work, and his social life, the boy took the time to visit the girl at the mental hospital whenever he could, offering her encouragement and empathy. He also attended support groups, such as NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), where he received guidance and fellowship from people who had experienced similar situations with their loved ones. As time passed, the girl made significant improvements in her mental health, and her treatment team deemed her stable enough to be discharged from the mental hospital. With the love and support of her family, friends, and the boy, the girl re-entered society and began the long journey toward creating a healthier and happier life for herself. Through this experience, both the girl and the boy gained a newfound appreciation for the importance of mental health and the power of understanding, acceptance, and empathy for those suffering from mental illnesses. Together, they became advocates for mental health awareness and sought to break the stigma surrounding mental illness, helping others recognize the courage and resilience it takes to face these challenges head-on."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Rich in history and nature, the park covers a vast expanse of land, featuring magnificent gardens, lush greenery, and exquisite architecture. Complementing our frequent visits to the park, we were also avid at honing our horse riding skills and often partook in training sessions at Rideskolen, a reputable and nearby riding school. It wasn't just about improving our equestrian abilities; it was about bonding with such noble and majestic creatures while cultivating a sense of discipline and camaraderie. My friendship with Helle was genuinely a bond that held strong, weathering the storms that life occasionally throws our way. Truthfully, we were inseparable.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - DVD (an abbreviation of \\"digital versatile disc\\" or \\"digital video disc\\") is a digital optical disc storage format invented and developed by Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Panasonic in 1995. The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions.  - Nolan Kay Bushnell (born February 5, 1943) is an American electrical engineer and businessman. He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza-Time Theaters chain. Bushnell has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News Innovator of the Year award, and was named one of \\"Newsweek\\"s \\"50 Men Who Changed America.\\" Bushnell has started more than twenty companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry. He is currently on the board of Anti-Aging Games, but his latest venture is an educational software company called Brainrush that is using video game technology in educational software, incorporating real brain science, in a way that Bushnell believes will fundamentally change education. Nolan, who is co-founder and chairman of Brainrush, believes that Brainrush will be his biggest success.  - A ROM cartridge, sometimes referred to simply as a cartridge or cart, is a removable enclosure containing ROM designed to be connected to a consumer electronics device such as a home computer, video game console and to a lesser extent, electronic musical instruments. ROM cartridges can be used to load software such as video games or other application programs.  - Activision Publishing , Inc. is an American video game publisher . It was founded on October 1 , 1979 and was the world 's first independent developer and distributor of video games for gaming consoles . Its first products were cartridges for the Atari 2600 video console system published from July 1980 for the US market and from August 1981 for the international market ( UK ) . Activision is now one of the largest third party video game publishers in the world and was also the top publisher for 2007 in the United States . On January 18 , 2008 , Activision announced they were the top US publisher in 2007 , according to the NPD Group . Its former CEO is Robert Kotick , who was the Chief Executive Officer of Activision , Inc. since February 1991 until Activision and Vivendi Games merged on July 9 , 2008 to create the newly formed company known as Activision Blizzard . On July 25 , 2013 , Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi , valuing US  2.34 billion . As a result , Activision Blizzard became an independent company .  - Market research is any organized effort to gather information about target markets or customers. It is a very important component of business strategy. The term is commonly interchanged with marketing research; however, expert practitioners may wish to draw a distinction, in that \\"marketing\\" research is concerned specifically about marketing processes, while \\"market\\" research is concerned specifically with markets.  - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.  - Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Marketing is the study and management of exchange relationships. The American Marketing Association has defined marketing as \\"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\\"   - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview.  - A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by a video game developer. As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising.  - The Fairchild Channel F is a home video game console released by Fairchild Semiconductor in November 1976 across North America at the retail price of 169.95. It was also released in Japan in October the following year. It has the distinction of being the first programmable ROM cartridgebased video game console, and the first console to use a microprocessor. It was launched as the Video Entertainment System, or VES, but when Atari released its VCS the next year, Fairchild renamed its machine. By 1977, the Fairchild Channel F had sold 250,000 units, trailing behind sales of the VCS.  - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\".  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Atari Interactive is a name used by several separate groups and corporations since the mid-1990s. In 1996, it was the name of Atari Corporation's PC publishing division, bringing games like the Atari Jaguar's \\"Tempest 2000\\" to the PC platform. From 1998 to 2001, Atari Interactive, Inc. was the name of the corporate entity that held the Atari properties purchased from JTS by Hasbro in 1998, and functioned as the retro publishing subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive. It is currently the name of a wholly owned subsidiary of Atari, SA (formerly Infogrames), who is the current owner of the Atari brand and various other properties formerly belonging to Hasbro Interactive. It was formed in 2001, when IESA acquired Hasbro Interactive and proceeded to rename it to Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive, Inc. as part of its worldwide reorganization to focus on use of the Atari brand.  - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the North American video game crash of 1983.  - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.  - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development  the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games.  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.

Answer:","output":"Frederick Varley, born Frederick Horsman Varley on January 2, 1881, in Sheffield, England, was a renowned painter known for his association with the Group of Seven. The Group of Seven was a collective of Canadian landscape painters established in the early 20th century who were dedicated to capturing the natural beauty of the Canadian wilderness. As a child, Varley showed an interest in art, which led him to study at various art schools in England. In 1912, he immigrated to Canada, settling initially in Toronto, Ontario. There, he worked as both a commercial artist and an art teacher, inspiring generations of Canadian artists. His passion for painting fueled his artistic pursuits, and he quickly established himself as a talented landscape painter. Varley's illustrious career as a painter took a turn in 1920 when he joined the Group of Seven. Alongside his fellow artists, he embraced the bold use of color and expressive brushstrokes to capture the unique character of Canadian landscapes. Varley's work within the Group of Seven contributed significantly to the development of the Canadian art scene, and he eventually gained international recognition for his evocative paintings. Throughout his life, Varley continued to paint and teach, contributing to the expansion of the Canadian art scene. His work has since become synonymous with the country's artistic identity. After a life dedicated to the arts, Frederick Horsman Varley passed away in Toronto, Ontario, on September 8, 1969. Overall, Frederick Varley's life is best remembered for his exceptional painting skills and his impact on Canadian art through his involvement in the Group of Seven. His dedication to capturing the essence of Canadian landscapes has left a lasting impression on the country's artistic identity, and his influence continues to be felt in today's art world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. They were looking for human remains. But all they found were some shoes and a pile of black ash. It was hot in the basement. The fire was still smouldering. Warm, scummy water dripped from the ceiling. Outside, hundreds of people had gathered. Being there was a form of defiance. In the Iraqi capital, any crowded, dark street is a potential target for a suicide bomber. Perhaps sharing infinite sadness makes it easier to bear. Many people cried, or prayed. I saw a Christian clergyman lighting candles and making the sign of the cross as well as young people chanting a Shia Muslim anthem for the dead. Just because so many Iraqi civilians have been massacred does not make senseless killing any easier to bear for the survivors. It is doubtful whether Iraqis who are so caught up in the pain of daily life will take much interest in the long-delayed publication of the UK's official inquiry into its part in the invasion of 2003. Many people I have spoken to have already made up their minds about the impact of the invasion on Iraq. One of these is Kadhim al-Jabbouri, a man who became a symbol of the Iraqi peoples' rejection and hatred of Saddam Hussein. On 9 April 2003, the American spearhead reached central Baghdad. Hours before they arrived, Kadhim, who was a champion weightlifter, decided to bring down the big bronze statue of Saddam Hussein that stood on a plinth in Firdous Square. Kadhim owned a popular motorcycle shop and was a Harley-Davidson expert. For a while he fixed Saddam's bikes, but after the regime executed 14 members of his family he refused any more work. The regime's response to his effrontery was to put him in jail for two years on trumped-up charges. Kadhim is a survivor. In prison, he started a gym and a weight-lifting club, and was eventually released in one of Saddam's periodic amnesties. But on the morning of 9 April, Kadhim wanted his own personal moment of liberation and revenge. He took his sledgehammer and began to swing it at the plinth beneath the towering bronze dictator. Journalists came out of the Palestine Hotel on the square and started broadcasting and taking pictures. Kadhim says their presence protected him from Saddam's secret policemen, who melted away as the sound of American guns came closer. When the Americans arrived they looped a steel cable round the bronze Saddam's head and used a winch to help Kadhim finish the job. It all happened live on international TV. The image of furious and delighted Iraqis slapping the fallen statue with their shoes went around the world. Kadhim said his story was told to President George W Bush in the Oval Office. But he now wishes he had left his sledgehammer at home. Kadhim, like many Iraqis, blames the invaders for starting a chain of events that destroyed the country. He longs for the certainties and stability of Saddam's time. First, he says, he realised it was not going to be liberation, but occupation. Then he hated the corruption, mismanagement and violence in the new Iraq. Most of all he despises Iraq's new leaders. \\"Saddam has gone, and we have one thousand Saddams now,\\" he says. \\"It wasn't like this under Saddam. There was a system. There were ways.  We didn't like him, but he was better than those people.\\" \\"Saddam never executed people without a reason.  He was as solid as a wall. There was no corruption or looting, it was safe. You could be safe.\\" Many Iraqis echo that. Saddam's regime was harsh, and it could be murderous. He led the country into a series of disastrous wars and brought crippling international sanctions down on their heads. But with the benefit of 13 years of hindsight, the world that existed before 9 April 2003 seems to be a calmer, more secure place. They have not had a proper day of peace since the old regime fell. As for democracy, many I have spoken to believe the hopelessly sectarian political system is broken. At least, they say, law and order existed under Saddam. Some hoped things might get better after the army's victory over IS in Falluja. The devastating bomb attack in Baghdad in the early hours of Sunday has blasted that hope away. I asked Kadhim he would do if he could meet Tony Blair. \\"I would say to him you are a criminal, and I'd spit in his face.\\" And what would he say to George Bush? \\"I'd say you're criminal too. You killed the children of Iraq.  You killed the women and you killed the innocent.  I would say the same to Blair.  And to the coalition that invaded Iraq.  I will say to them you are criminals and you should be brought to justice.\\" A chain of consequences that leads back to the invasion of 2003 caused Iraq's perpetual war. The Americans and Britain removed a hated dictator, and dissolved his army and state. But they had no real plan to rebuild the country they had broken. They improvised - and made matters worse. Jihadists were not in Iraq before the invasion.  Shia and Sunni Muslims, whose sectarian civil war started during the occupation, could co-exist. The invaders did not have enough troops to control Iraq. Jihadists poured across open borders. Al-Qaeda established itself here, and eventually was reborn as so-called Islamic State. Iraqis have often made matters worse for themselves, but it was mistakes by the US and Britain that pushed Iraq down the road to catastrophe.

Kadhim, a man from Iraq, helped to knock down a statue of Saddam Hussein when the invasion happened. But now, he feels that things might have been better before.

As the robber becomes increasingly agitated, Cole approaches him, calls him a coward, and dares the robber to shoot him.  Michael intercedes and attempts to wrestle the gun away from the robber, only to be shot in the gut.  After Cole calls an ambulance, he receives a phone call from a friend who invites him out to drinks.  Cole accepts on the condition that it is not a house party.

Should I validate this answer? Options: 1). No; 2). Yes; Answer:","output":"1). No; The suggested answer does not directly address the question about the location of the first canal in Panama. It instead focuses on the functioning of the current Panama Canal with its locks and Gatun Lake.  Allow me to provide you with a more suitable answer: The first canal in the Panama region was actually the failed French attempt to build an interoceanic canal, known as the Panama Canal. This French effort, which began in 1881 under the direction of Ferdinand de Lesseps, was located in the same general area as the current Panama Canal, running from the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts of the Isthmus of Panama. However, the French project failed due to a variety of factors, including tropical diseases, engineering challenges, and financial difficulties. In 1904, the United States took over the project and redesigned the French canal, which led to the construction of the current Panama Canal that opened in 1914. The Panama Canal, as it exists now, runs 50 miles (80 kilometers) across the Isthmus of Panama, connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. It comprises a complex system of locks, including those situated at the Miraflores Locks on the Pacific side and the Gatun Locks on the Atlantic side, which lift and then lower ships to and from the artificial Gatun Lake, elevated 85 feet (26 meters) above sea level. In conclusion, while the provided answer mentioned locks and Gatun Lake, it failed to directly answer the question about the location of the first canal in Panama. The first canal project in Panama was in the same location as the current Panama Canal, but it was not completed and was later replaced by the present-day canal built by the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to clean a pot after cooking rice?","output":"To clean a pot after cooking rice, follow these step-by-step instructions to ensure the pot is thoroughly cleaned and ready for its next use. 1. Allow the pot to cool: Before attempting to clean the pot, give it some time to cool down to avoid burning yourself. Wait until the pot has reached a safe temperature to handle. 2. Remove leftover rice: Use a spatula or wooden spoon to scrape out any leftover rice from the pot. This will make the cleaning process easier and prevent food waste. Step 3: Soak the pot in water: Fill the pot with warm water, ensuring that the water covers the bottom and sides where any rice residue may be present. Add a drop or two of mild dish soap for added cleaning power. Allow the pot to soak for about 10 to 15 minutes. This will help to loosen any stuck-on rice and make it easier to remove. Step 4: Use a soft sponge or cloth: Start by gently scrubbing the sides and bottom of the pot with a sponge or cloth. Be careful not to use abrasive materials, such as steel wool, which may scratch the surface. Step 5: Focus on problem areas: If any rice remains stuck to the pot, focus your scrubbing on those areas. Apply a little extra pressure with the sponge or cloth if necessary. If there is still some stubborn residue, you can use a nylon brush or scraper to gently remove it. Step 6: Rinse the pot: Once you have removed all of the rice residue, rinse the pot thoroughly under warm running water. Make sure to remove all soap residue, as it could affect the taste of future dishes. Step 7: Dry the pot: Use a clean, dry towel to dry the pot, or allow it to air dry on a drying rack. Step 8: Inspect the pot: Double-check the pot to make sure there is no remaining rice residue or soap. If any areas still need attention, repeat the appropriate cleaning steps.

A: Aiming to reduce NATO power in the Mediterranean, in 1971 Libya requested that Malta cease to allow NATO to use its land for a military base, in turn offering them foreign aid.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: I apologize for my previous response as it does not correctly answer the question. To address your query, let me provide you with the correct information. Before discussing the number of Italians living in Libya prior to October 1970, it is important to understand the historical context. Italy colonized Libya in 1911 and held control until the end of World War II. During this period, a significant number of Italians moved to Libya as part of the Fascist regime's colonial plans, which included agricultural and infrastructural development. Many Italians ended up settling in Libya, forming an Italian population within the country. The Italian presence in Libya reached its peak during the mid-1930s under Italian leader Benito Mussolini. The number of Italians living in Libya varied during the years, and estimates are not exact. However, it is estimated that around 110,000 to 150,000 Italians lived in Libya by the end of the 1930s, constituting about 12-15% of the total population at the time. After World War II, the situation changed significantly. Italy lost its possessions in North Africa, and by 1951, Libya gained independence under UN administration. Despite this political shift, many Italians remained in Libya, and according to the 1954 Italo-Libyan Treaty, Italians had the right to stay and work there. The Italian population in Libya continued to decline, though, due to several factors, including political and social changes in the newly independent country. By the late 1960s, the number of Italians in Libya was relatively low. However, the specific number of Italians living in Libya right before October 1970 is difficult to determine due to limited data and regional complexities. We can estimate that the Italian population in Libya at that time would have been significantly lower compared to its peak in the 1930s, possibly ranging between 20,000 to 30,000. In 1970, under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime, the Libyan government ordered the expulsion of the remaining Italian population, and their properties were confiscated. This marks the end of the significant Italian presence in Libya."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The Real Mess Behind Mariagate Forgive me for asking, but I was out of the country last week and on the road a day or two back here at home. Do I have this right– Citigroup Chairman Charles Prince Charles Prince , riding hard astride the financial colossus with 140 billion in annual revenue and 1.5 trillion in assets, has just fired a high-roller lieutenant for allegedly having an illicit affair with the Money Honey from CNBC? Of course it doesn’t read quite that way in some financial media, which devoted abundant space to the flap–that would be way too specific and far too difficult to prove–even as they feasted on it on their front pages. But that is precisely what they and the rest of the media are hinting at, in weasly words of innuendo and wimpy off-the-record insinuation. This gossipfest for a pimped-out press likely comes from Citigroup sympathizers–maybe even from in-house leakers. And so publications devote precious column inches in tacit pursuit of trivial trysting that may never have happened–and get diverted from the real story, the far bigger one that actually matters: Citigroup is faltering, Chuck Prince’s power and his reign are at risk, and he has just fired a hitter who was loyal to the man Prince succeeded: the behemoth’s patriarch and architect, Sanford I. Weill. Come to think of it, this sounds like a shrewd crisis-PR strategy. Shame on all of you. In case you missed it: Last week Todd Thomson Todd Thomson , chief of Citigroup’s wealth management unit, got whacked by Prince, officially for excessive spending and such, but unofficially for what one financial newspaper genteely described as “the way that Mr. Thomson managed his friendship with” CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo. “Managed his friendship”? Cue video of the old Monty Python sketch with Eric Idle elbowing the fellow next to him and asking about sex: “Nudge nudge, snap snap, grin grin, wink wink, say no more?” Never mind that the stock of this financial services laggard has gone up only 12% in three years (while the S&P 500 is up 28%), that Citi ranks a lowly 28th of 42 banks in our own Platinum List performance rankings, and that it routinely trails Bank of America in return on assets. And never mind whether Citigroup, to unlock better value, should undergo a smashup and break itself up entirely or peddle some businesses to private equity buyers. (Sell the credit-card biz! Bail out of consumer banking!) Instead, let’s get the media machine going ’round and ’round over whether Thomson might have scored on the corporate jet. But Citigroup shareholders dont care whether a Citigroup executive might have cheated on his wife, and Citigroup leakers shouldn’t, either. None of this has any bearing on business: It just doesnt matter. What Citigroup shareholders do care about is the stock price and what Prince is doing to lift it–and how he manages the company. And there’s plenty here to warrant concern. We are told Prince sacked his second as a cost-crackdown move because Thomson had a palatial fireplace installed in his office, but one wonders where the chairman was when the jackhammers were grinding away at the start. We are told Prince had warned Thomson to cut back on Maria-time at client functions–yet she adds star power that can make Citi look good in exchange for her access to the bigs in the room. We are told Prince was “jolted” (in the lead of The Wall Street Journal‘s Page One exposé on Jan. 24) by Thomson’s temerity in putting 5 million into a short-run TV series on the Sundance Channel to be hosted by Robert Redford and–omidgod!–the dreaded Bartiromo. Yet five million bucks in a 140 billion company? That is 1.3% of the revenue that Citi brings in–in a single, 24-hour day. Moreover, its a cheap way to align Citi with the greenie movement and host super-rich private banking clients on the film festival circuit. And we are told, as the Journal intoned, with an upraised eyebrow, that Maria Bartiromo and Todd Thomson were “spotted” at the plush eatery Daniel in New York in late 2005, dining alone. “Word of the sighting spread through Citigroup the next day.” Sure it did–the foreign currency traders must have gone wild. Let’s get this right: A journalist working her sources goes out to dinner with a source who runs a big business for a huge company she covers. Isn’t that what journos do all the time? Something odious and sexist and archaic drives these artfully veiled accounts. Bartiromo, who plays it straight and is fiercely committed to her job, would not have been made a target if she weighed 200 pounds and looked like Winston Churchill. And Thomson wouldn’t have gotten pilloried in the press if there weren’t enemies inside or close to Citi feeding off-the-record invective to the writers. Let us get back to business: Citi has 1,000 banking branches in the U.S., while Bank of America has six times as many; it has failed to reap billions in private equity bets the way Goldman Sachs routinely does; and it runs third in credit cards. If the numbers suck when the company reports earnings in coming weeks and quarters, we’ll know the real reason for this brouhaha: Mariagate was a way to distract attention from the real screw-ups at Citigroup itself. Comments are turned off for this post. Summary:","output":"The article discusses the dismissal of Todd Thomson, chief of Citigroup's wealth management unit by Citigroup Chairman Charles Prince. The dismissal is unofficially linked to Thomson's relationship with CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo, though officially claimed to be for excessive spending. The author argues that the media focus on this potential scandal diverts attention from the real issue: Citigroup's poor performance, with a stock increase of only 12% in three years and a low ranking on the Platinum List performance rankings.

Options: - stupid - inhumane - human - dangerous - strange  The answer is \\"human\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"human\\" because, despite our various behaviors and quirks, we are all part of the human species. This means that we share common attributes and characteristics that make us unique from other life forms. People might sometimes seem like robots due to their repetitive actions, routines, or adherence to certain societal norms and expectations. However, it's essential to remember that humans are complex beings with a wide range of emotions, thoughts, and experiences that set us apart from robots or machines. In comparison to the other options provided, \\"human\\" is the most accurate description for the following reasons: 1. \\"Stupid\\" implies a lack of intelligence, which is not true for everyone. Each person has their own set of skills, knowledge, and abilities that contribute to their intelligence in various ways. 2. \\"Inhumane\\" suggests that people are devoid of compassion or empathy, which is also not accurate. While some individuals may exhibit inhumane behavior, many people have the capacity to empathize with, care for, and help others. 3. \\"Dangerous\\" could apply to some individuals, but it is not a defining characteristic of humans as a whole. Although there are people in the world who pose a threat to others, the majority of humans are not inherently dangerous. 4. \\"Strange\\" indicates that people are bizarre or unusual, which might be true for some individuals but does not describe the entire human population. Human behavior can be diverse and intricate, but categorizing everyone as strange would be an oversimplification. In conclusion, while humans may exhibit a wide range of behaviors, we are all part of the same species, which sets us apart from robots or other life forms. Recognizing our shared humanity can help us better appreciate and understand one another's individual differences, broadening our perspective on the world around us."},{"instruction":"Q: I have waited tables, but before that, our friend group were regulars at several local “open all night” establishments.

Answer choices: - water conservation  - Veins and arteries.  - hydrogen and oxygen  - Animal survival  - to move people  - heat energy  - heating liquids  - sailplanes to fly The answer to this question is:","output":"Sailplanes to fly. High pressure systems play a crucial role in allowing sailplanes to soar. A high pressure system is an area where the atmospheric pressure is higher than the surrounding area. This generally leads to stable atmospheric conditions with little turbulence or strong weather disturbances. In turn, this creates a conducive environment for uplift and thermals, which are essential for sailplane flights. Thermals are columns of rising warm air that form when the sun heats the ground, causing localized heating of the air near the surface. This warm air then rises vertically, creating an updraft that sailplanes can use to gain altitude without the need for an engine. The presence of high pressure systems increases the likelihood of thermals forming, as the stable atmosphere helps to preserve and enhance these rising air columns. Not only do high pressure systems provide the necessary uplift for sailplanes, but they also contribute to clear and sunny weather conditions. Visibility is critically important for glider pilots, as it enables them to identify thermals and navigate effectively. Therefore, high pressure systems support sailplane flights by providing flight-friendly weather conditions that include thermals, reduced turbulence, and clear skies. While the presence of a high pressure system mainly benefits sailplanes in terms of flight, other options mentioned in the question are not directly influenced by high pressure systems. For instance, water conservation, veins and arteries, hydrogen and oxygen, animal survival, moving people, heat energy, and heating liquids are related to different aspects of nature and science, but they do not play a significant role in allowing sailplanes to fly. In summary, high pressure systems allow sailplanes to fly by providing optimal weather conditions that include stable atmospheric conditions, uplift support from thermals, and clear visibility for navigation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: almost every day i uh this spring has been uh a little hard to keep up the pace because uh we've had a lot of family activities my wife has taken up skiing Hypothesis: This spring was difficult to keep pace with everything going on. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The statement provided - \\"almost every day this spring has been a little hard to keep up the pace because we've had a lot of family activities\\" - indicates that the individual has found it challenging to maintain their usual pace and stay on top of things during this spring season. This difficulty in keeping up with daily life is primarily attributed to the significant number of family activities taking place, further supported by the subsequent mention of the wife taking up skiing. The hypothesis - \\"This spring was difficult to keep pace with everything going on\\" - is essentially a rephrasing of the premise, with slight modifications, but it still conveys the same idea. Both statements imply that the person has found it tough to manage their time and personal life due to the increase in family activities and responsibilities during this spring. Hence, the assertion can be made that the premise does entail the hypothesis, as both statements are conveying the same core idea: the challenge of keeping pace this spring due to numerous family activities and obligations."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"If there are more plant roots growing near or on rocks, it will have a more significant impact on soil erosion. This is due to the interconnected nature of the processes involved in soil erosion and the role that plant roots play in these processes. The supposed perturbation in this scenario is directly impacting a step of the process. When plant roots grow near or on rocks, they exert pressure on the rock, causing it to break apart. Simultaneously, the roots release acids that dissolve parts of the rock, further breaking it down. Over time, the rocks are broken into smaller and smaller pieces, which then become more susceptible to erosion. Erosion occurs when wind, water, or other forces remove and transport these tiny rock fragments away from their original location.  As more plant roots grow on and near rocks, they will have a direct impact on the first step and second steps of the processes mentioned above, which lead to soil erosion. These steps include the breaking apart of rocks and dissolving parts of the rock through the release of plant acids. Since the roots are directly affecting these steps, they are accelerating the rate at which rocks break down, creating more soil and rock particles that are vulnerable to erosion.  An indirect impact on the process might include factors such as climate changes that influence plant growth or forces like wind or water that influence erosion by transporting particles away. However, the direct impact of more plant roots on the process is increasing the rate of rock breakdown and dissolution, thereby accelerating the natural process of soil erosion. In conclusion, the presence of more plant roots directly impacts the steps in the process that lead to soil erosion, specifically the initial breaking apart of rocks and the dissolution of rock material by plant acids. This direct impact increases the chances of soil erosion, as more broken rocks and soil materials become exposed and susceptible to forces like wind, water, and other elements responsible for erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He treated his wife for an electrical burn and luckily had gauze not just a band-aid as the  Select from: [1]. band-aid was preferred for this kind of injury.. [2]. gauze was preferred for this kind of injury.. Answer:","output":"2. gauze was preferred for this kind of injury. He treated his wife for an electrical burn and luckily had gauze not just a band-aid as the gauze was preferred for this kind of injury. In cases of electrical burns, using gauze provides a more comprehensive solution for wound management and promotes a better healing environment. It is crucial to handle such burns with utmost care to prevent complications and ensure a healthy recovery. To begin the treatment process, the husband first needed to separate his wife from the source of the electric current or shut off the power supply to avoid further injury. Once the victim was no longer in contact with the electrical source, he carefully assessed the severity of the burn and took vital signs such as pulse, heart rate, and temperature. As electrical burns often cause both external and internal injuries, it was essential for the husband to remain vigilant and provide a thorough examination. Having established that immediate medical attention was not required, he gently cleansed the wound with mild soap and warm water to remove dirt and bacteria. The husband then carefully patted the area dry using a sterile cloth or gauze to avoid aggravating the injury further. Gauze is the preferred choice for treating electrical burns, as it offers several advantages over traditional adhesive bandages like band-aids. Gauze is thinner and more flexible, which allows it to provide more substantial coverage on irregularly shaped burns. Additionally, gauze can be layered and wrapped freely around the affected area, creating a snug yet nonrestrictive fit that is less likely to interfere with circulation as the wound heals. Before applying the sterile gauze to the electrical burn, the husband applied a soothing burn ointment which acted as a protective barrier, reducing the risk of infection and aiding in the healing process. Next, he carefully wrapped the gauze around the burned area, ensuring that it fully covered the wound without being too tight or causing discomfort. To further protect the wound from possible infections, the husband secured the gauze with medical tape, taking care not to place the tape directly on the burn as it could cause irritation. The gauze would need to be changed daily, and the wound site monitored closely for any signs of infection or complications. In treating electrical burns, gauze provides both an effective barrier against contaminants and a gentle means of securing the burn ointment to the affected area. Thanks to the husband's quick thinking and appropriate choice of wound care materials, his wife's wound could now begin the healing process, overall reducing the risk of subsequent complications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bartlett's decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as \\"Shipwreck Camp\\", was more or less established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, 38 miles (61 km) from their intended destination.

Write an article based on this summary: – Sorry to burst your bubble, but whatever bargain you scored on Black Friday pales in comparison to the deal a man got when he purchased a storage unit in Southern California in October. It's a tale conveyed by Dan Dotson of A&E's Storage Wars, who was the one who actually sold the unit for 500 through his company American Auctioneers, and who learned what happened next when a woman came up to him at a Nov. 1 charity event. \\"She said, 'I just gotta tell you this story, my husband works for a guy that bought a unit from you and there was a safe in there,'\\" Dotson recounts to the Desert Sun. Inside the safe was cash—7.5 million of it. In a YouTube video in which he explains the story (the original auction wasn't recorded for A&E), he says that when the storage unit's original owners found out it had been sold they reached out to the new owners via a lawyer to make a deal to get their money back, making an initial offer of 600,000. They ended up letting the new owner keep 1.2 million. People does the simple math: that's 1,199,500 \\"in profit on a measly 500 investment.\\" (Another couple recently made a million-dollar discovery.)","output":"Title: The Ultimate Storage Unit Find: A Treasure Worth Millions Introduction Imagine paying 500 for a storage unit, only to find that it holds a safe containing a whopping 7.5 million in cash. That's exactly what happened to a lucky man in Southern California in October. Often, Black Friday is talked about as a day when shoppers can score the best deals. However, nothing can surpass this ultimate deal discovered during a storage unit auction. The story unfolds as Dan Dotson, a prominent figure from A&E's Storage Wars, narrates the jaw-dropping series of events. Purchase of the Storage Unit and the Discovery In October, a man purchased a storage unit in Southern California for 500, a transaction facilitated through Dan Dotson's company, American Auctioneers. Little did he know, his life was about to change dramatically. Inside the unit, he discovered a safe containing an astonishing sum of 7.5 million in cold hard cash.  It wasn't until a charity event on November 1st that the incredible story reached Dan Dotson. A woman approached him, eager to share the tale as her husband worked for the man who had made the life-altering purchase. Dan Dotson, understandably, was just as surprised by the news as the lucky buyer must have been. He proceeded to share the story in a YouTube video, as it hadn't been captured on camera for the A&E show. The Original Owners' Offer for the Money When the original owners of the storage unit realized that they had lost access to the safe and the millions of dollars inside, panic set in. They contacted a lawyer who reached out to the new owner, hoping to strike a deal and recover their lost money. Initially, they offered 600,000 to the new owner as compensation. However, after negotiations, it was ultimately settled that the new owner could keep a staggering 1.2 million, while the original owners received the remaining 6.3 million.  A Profitable Deal, Indeed This million-dollar luck by the man only proves that it undoubtedly was one of the most profitable investments one could make. People magazine did the math: a profit of 1,199,500 on a mere 500 investment. It's a lucky break most of us can only dream about. Conclusion In the world of storage unit auctions, there's always the potential for discovering hidden treasures. The Southern California man's life-changing find of 7.5 million in cash certainly sets the bar high for what can be considered a great deal. This remarkable story not only enthralls those involved in the storage unit auctions world but also drives home that, sometimes, reality can truly be stranger – and infinitely more fascinating – than fiction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump is sending a 4.4 trillion budget request to Congress that includes money for a southern border wall and building up the military, but is projected to increase the federal deficit by more than 1 trillion. White House officials all but acknowledged the proposal unveiled Monday has little chance of becoming law — Congress alone controls federal government spending. But the White House insisted the budget proposal still sends an important message about Trump's priorities. \\"This is a messaging document,\\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing Monday. The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. But the plan would still not balance the federal budget, in part because of reduced federal revenue due to tax cuts passed last year. Democrats widely rejected the plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposal a \\"brutal collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.\\" The proposal's failure to eliminate debt is also likely to upset some Republicans, who have traditionally opposed budget deficits. \\"It's simply adjusting to the Washington, D.C., we live in,\\" Mulvaney said, stressing that the new budget plan would help \\"turn the tide\\" on national debt. The White House proposal builds on the massive, two-year spending bill passed last week by Congress and signed by the president. That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs. Mulvaney, a former lawmaker and long-time opponent of federal debt, has acknowledged he likely would not have supported the bill were he still in Congress. But he said the new White House proposal does not mean that all of the money approved by Congress must be spent. \\"These are spending caps, these are not spending floors,\\" he said. Under the two-year budget deal reached last week by Congress, the Pentagon will get a record-high 700 billion for 2018 — fulfilling a Trump campaign pledge. \\"We took care of the military like it's never...

Background: Brock Edward Lesnar was born on July 12, 1977 in Webster, South Dakota, the son of Stephanie and Richard Lesnar, and grew up on his parents' dairy farm in Webster. He is of German descent. He has two older brothers, Troy and Chad, and a younger sister, Brandi. At age 17, Lesnar joined the Army National Guard, where he was assigned to an office job after his red-green colorblindness was deemed hazardous to his desire to work with explosives. Context: After his match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, Lesnar sidelined his career in WWE to pursue a career in the National Football League (NFL) despite not playing American football since high school. The WWE issued this statement on their official website, WWE.com, following his departure:  Brock Lesnar has made a personal decision to put his WWE career on hold to prepare to tryout for the National Football League this season. Brock has wrestled his entire professional career in the WWE and we are proud of his accomplishments and wish him the best in his new endeavor.  Lesnar later told a Minnesota radio show that he had \\"three wonderful years\\" in WWE, but had grown unhappy and always wanted to play professional football, adding that he did not want to be 40 years old and wondering if he could have \\"made it\\" in football. In an interview about the NFL, he stated:  This is no load of bull; it's no WWE stunt. I am dead serious about this. I ain't afraid of anything and I ain't afraid of anybody. I've been an underdog in athletics since I was five. I got zero college offers for wrestling. Now people say I can't play football, that it's a joke. I say I can. I'm as good an athlete as a lot of guys in the NFL, if not better. I've always had to fight for everything. I wasn't the best technician in amateur wrestling but I was strong, had great conditioning, and a hard head. Nobody could break me. As long as I have that, I don't give a damn what anybody else thinks.  Lesnar had a great showing at the NFL Combine, but on April 17 a minivan collided with his motorbike and he suffered a broken jaw and left hand, a bruised pelvis and a pulled groin. Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching Lesnar work out. The Minnesota Vikings worked out Lesnar on June 11, but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident. On July 24 it was reported that he was nearly recovered from his groin injury. He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team. He was released by the Vikings on August 30. Lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa, but declined due to his desire to stay in the United States with his family. He had several football cards produced of him during his time with the Vikings. Question: What did he do after the accident?

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Alvin York (Gary Cooper), a poor young Tennessee hillbilly, is an exceptional marksman, but a ne'er-do-well prone to drinking and fighting, which does not make things any easier for his patient mother (Margaret Wycherly). He changes when he meets winsome Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie), and works night and day at strenuous odd jobs to accumulate the payment for a certain good farm so she'll marry him. On the very day payment is due, he wins the final needed amount at a target-shooting contest, but on being told that the farm has just been sold to his romantic rival, he returns to his dissolute ways. Late that night, he is struck by lightning during a rainstorm while en route to attack the man who had cheated him. Finding himself outside the meeting house where a revival is going, he goes in and undergoes a religious awakening and vows never to get angry at anyone ever again. He makes amends with the men who cheated him out of the land, and tries to with Gracie. When the U.S. declares war in World War I, York tries to avoid induction into the Army as a conscientious objector because of his religious beliefs, but is drafted nonetheless. His status as a conscientious objector is rejected since his church has no official standing, and he reluctantly reports to Camp Gordon for basic training. His superiors discover that he is a phenomenal marksman and decide to promote him to corporal. York still wants nothing to do with the Army and killing. Major Buxton (Stanley Ridges), his sympathetic commanding officer, tries to change York's mind, citing sacrifices made by others all throughout the history of the United States. He gives York a leave to go home and think it over. He promises York a recommendation for his exemption as a conscientious objector if York remains unconvinced. While York is fasting and pondering, the wind blows his Bible open to the verse \\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.\\" York reports back for duty and tells his superiors that he can... A:","output":"In the movie plot, \\"Alvin York\\" portrays several significant developments within the protagonist's character and his relationship with others and his beliefs. It also provides an intriguing blend of a romantic story, spiritual transformation, and heroic acts during World War I. Given this information, a suitable question could be: \\"How does the transformation of Alvin York from a ne'er-do-well Tennessee hillbilly into a national hero during World War I reflect on his relationships, personal beliefs, and life choices, and how does this transformation impact his personal life, especially his relationship with Gracie Williams, and his stance on religious beliefs and war? Moreover, what role does Major Buxton play in York's change of heart about taking part in the war, and how does the verse \\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's\\" influence York's decision to serve his country?\\"    This question encapsulates the plot's different facets and challenges the respondent to deeply consider how the protagonist evolves throughout the story. It delves into each notable aspect of the plot, from York's initial disposition and his love interest to his spiritual awakening and eventual participation in the war. It also probes how his interactions with different characters, particularly Major Buxton, impact his perspective and choices, and how a specific Bible verse comes to bear on his perceived duty towards his country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If it only had one then it wouldve been perfect.But yeah overall i have used this for computer as well and it works swell.I played Socom,star wars and listened to my music and it handles everything.The slight bad part of it is that if someone were to pull the wires out of the computer or what ever you have the headset hooked up to,the wire would mess up in the inside,like with what happened to mine,Siblings pulled it out of my psp and it easily broke.Mic still worked for some time but it went out a couple weeks later. Over all its a good item,just be careful when unplugging it. Answer: Answer:","output":"To determine if this product review is positive, let's analyze it step-by-step and justify each step: 1. Look for positive statements: - \\"Its great for the price\\" - \\"overall I have used this for computer as well and it works swell\\" - \\"it handles everything\\" - \\"Over all its a good item\\" These statements show that the reviewer finds value in the product and has had a good experience with it, which indicates a positive review element. 2. Look for negative statements or issues: - \\"sad part about this is it has 2 chords, one for mic and one for headphones\\" - \\"if someone were to pull the wires out of the computer... the wire would mess up in the inside\\" - \\"Mic still worked for some time but it went out a couple weeks later.\\" These statements show that the reviewer encountered some problems or found some aspects of the product less than ideal, which indicates a negative review element. 3. Evaluate the overall sentiment of the review: The review contains both positive and negative statements. However, despite mentioning the wire issue and design with two cords, the reviewer still concludes that \\"it's a good item.\\" They even provide a warning on how to prevent the issue with wires. Based on the analysis, although there are some negative points mentioned, the overall sentiment of the product review leans more towards positive. The reviewer has largely had a good experience with the product, and the negative aspects do not outweigh the positive statements.

What is the name for the branch of astronomy that relates to precise measurements and explanations of the positions and movements of celestial bodies? What is the answer?","output":"The branch of astronomy that relates to precise measurements and explanations of the positions and movements of celestial bodies is called Astrometry. Astrometry is a critical field in astronomy, as it provides essential information for various astronomical studies. Astrometry is an ancient discipline that has been practiced for thousands of years, with early observations recorded by ancient civilizations such as the Babylonians, the Chinese, and the Maya. Modern astrometry, however, started in the 17th century with the introduction of telescopic observations and more precise measurements. The primary goals of astrometry are to accurately measure the positions, distances, and movements of celestial objects such as stars, planets, and other astronomical phenomena. These measurements are essential for increasing our understanding of the universe's structure, the behaviors of celestial objects, and the underpinning physical laws that drive their motions. There are several important techniques in astrometry, including: 1. Positional astrometry: This involves the precise measurement of the angular positions of celestial objects on the celestial sphere. The data obtained from these measurements are often used to create stellar catalogs, which list positions and other properties of stars. 2. Parallax measurements: Parallax is the apparent change in the position of an object due to a change in the observer's position. By observing the parallax of stars, astronomers can calculate their distances from Earth, which helps in understanding the scale and structure of the universe. 3. Proper motion measurements: Proper motion is the apparent motion of a celestial object across the sky over time relative to distant background stars. By measuring the proper motion of stars, astronomers can study the kinematics and dynamics of our galaxy and determine the orbits of stars and other celestial bodies. 4. Radial velocity measurements: Radial velocity is the change in distance of a celestial object along the line of sight of the observer. By measuring the radial velocities of stars and other celestial objects, astronomers can investigate the motion of objects within the galaxy and the presence of exoplanets around other stars. Astrometry also plays a critical role in other astronomical studies, such as the determination of the celestial reference frame, which is a coordinate system for precisely defining the positions of celestial objects. Additionally, it contributes to fields like celestial mechanics, the study of the motion of celestial objects influenced by gravity and other forces, and astrodynamics, which is the application of celestial mechanics to the practical problems of space travel, spacecraft navigation, and mission planning. In summary, astrometry is the branch of astronomy that focuses on the precise measurements and explanations of the positions and movements of celestial bodies. It is a fundamental branch of astronomy that provides essential data and knowledge for a variety of astronomical studies, enabling a deeper understanding of our universe's composition, structure, and behaviors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Background: Stanley Donen ( DAWN-@n; born April 13, 1924) is an American film director and choreographer whose most celebrated works are Singin' in the Rain and On the Town, both of which he co-directed with actor and dancer Gene Kelly. Other noteworthy films include Royal Wedding, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face, Indiscreet, Damn Yankees!, Charade, and Two for the Road. He began his career in the chorus line on Broadway for director George Abbott, where he befriended Kelly. Context: After the success of Take Me Out to the Ball Game, Freed gave Donen and Kelly the chance to direct On the Town, released in 1949. The film was an adaptation of the Betty Comden and Adolph Green Broadway musical about sailors on leave in New York City and was the first musical to be filmed on location. Donen and Kelly had wanted to shoot the entire film in New York, but Freed would only allow them to spend one week away from the studio.  That week produced the film's famous opening number New York, New York. Away from both studio interference and sound stage constrictions, Donen and cinematographer Harold Rosson shot a scene on the streets of New York City that pioneered many cinematic techniques that would not be used again until they were popularized by the French New Wave ten years later. These techniques included spatial jump cuts, 360-degree pans, hidden cameras, abrupt changes of screen direction and non-professional actors. Donen's biographer Joseph A. Casper stated that the scene avoids being gratuitous or amateurish, while still \\"developing plot, describing the setting while conveying its galvanizing atmosphere and manic mood, introducing and delineating character.\\" Casper also said that \\"Today the film is regarded as a turning point: the first bona fide musical that moved dance, as well as the musical genre, out of the theater and captured it with and for film rather than on film; the first to make the city an important character; and the first to abandon the chorus.\\"  On the Town starred Kelly, Sinatra and Munshin as three sailors on a 24-hour shore leave in New York whose romantic pursuits lead them to Ann Miller, Betty Garrett and Vera-Ellen. The film was a success both financially and critically. It won the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and screenwriters Comden and Green won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. Like Orson Welles, Donen made his directorial debut at 25. Donen stated that Kelly was \\"responsible for most of the dance movements. I was behind the camera in the dramatic and musical sequences.\\" Kelly believed that he and Donen \\"were a good team. I thought we complemented each other very well.\\" Question: What happens to the sailors in the movie?. Whats the answer?","output":"In the movie On the Town, the three sailors - played by Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin - embark on a 24-hour shore leave in New York City. During their short time in the city, they pursue romantic interests, which leads them to meet Ann Miller, Betty Garrett, and Vera-Ellen. The film follows their adventures and experiences in New York as they balance their desires for love and exploration with the limited time they have on shore leave."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you're given a pair of sentences in the Persian Language written in the Persian alphabet.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: What is the first name of the oldest Darling child? john A:","output":"Title: \\"The Enigmatic Adventures of John Darling\\" In the quiet, idyllic town of Everdale, John Darling is the oldest among the three Darling children. He leads a rather ordinary life with his siblings, Michael and Wendy, and their loving parents, Mary and George. However, as John approaches his 18th birthday, he discovers a hidden, cryptic letter in the attic written by his long-lost great-grandfather. The letter is filled with mysterious clues and hints, which spark a burning curiosity in John. Fueled by the desire to know the truth, he embarks on an incredible journey to uncover his family's secret past with the help of his siblings and their childhood friend Lily. The quartet's journey takes them to the farthest corners of the world, filled with unforgettable encounters and close calls with dangerous adversaries who are seemingly aware of their quest and try to stop them. As they experience a whirlwind of emotion— from excitement and fear to love and self-discovery— John deciphers the complex web of riddles, which holds the key to his family's extraordinary legacy. As the adventure unfolds, John learns that his great-grandfather was a legendary explorer who discovered an ancient, hidden world filled with mystical treasures and powerful artifacts. The letters and clues were intentionally left behind as a test to see if John is worthy of inheriting this long-forgotten world and carrying on his great-grandfather's legacy. In a breathtaking finale, John and his friends overcome the final challenges that stand in their way, including confronting a shadowy organization that wants the ancient world for themselves. They eventually claim the hidden world as their own, promising to protect and preserve it for future generations. In the end, John Darling emerges not just as the oldest Darling child, but as a true hero. The experiences he gained throughout his journey have transformed him into a mature, wise, and fearless guardian of his great-grandfather's legacy, ready to face whatever other adventures life may have in store. The story serves as a beautiful testament to the power of family, friendship, and the human spirit to conquer the unknown."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Born on December 17, 1944, in Manchester, England, Hill has had a prolific acting career spanning several decades. He has appeared in numerous film, television, and theater productions, showcasing his versatility and talent. Before gaining worldwide recognition for his role in Titanic, Hill was already an accomplished actor. He started his career in the late 1970s with appearances in various British television series, including I Claudius (1976), Fox (1980), and Boys from the Blackstuff (1982). In the latter series, he played Yosser Hughes, which remains a critically acclaimed portrayal. Hill's film career began with Gandhi in 1982, followed by roles in other films, such as No Surrender (1985), Drowning by Numbers (1988), and The Ghost and the Darkness (1996). In Titanic, Bernard Hill's performance as Captain Smith garnered much attention and praise as he effectively captured the character's sense of duty, responsibility, and ultimately, the tragedy that unfolded. Hill's portrayal of Captain Smith highlighted the moral dilemmas and internal conflicts faced by the captain as he grapples with the impending disaster and the fate of the passengers and crew. This role contributed significantly to Hill's international recognition. Hill's career continued to flourish after Titanic, with notable performances in several successful films. A few of these projects include The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001-2003), where he portrayed King Théoden of Rohan; The Scorpion King (2002); and Valkyrie (2008), starring Tom Cruise. Bernard Hill's continued success and dedication to his craft have established him as a respected and admired actor within the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what ion drives the membrane potential back to resting membrane potential (repolarization)?? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the context of the question The question is about the ion that drives the membrane potential back to its resting state, also known as repolarization. This process occurs in the context of nerve cells (neurons) and electric signals (action potentials) that they transmit. Step 2: Recall relevant concepts In order to answer the question, we need to recall the key concepts related to membrane potential, depolarization, and repolarization. These concepts are: 1. Resting membrane potential: The difference in voltage across the plasma membrane of a neuron when it is at rest (not transmitting signals). It is typically around -70 mV. 2. Depolarization: The temporary increase in membrane potential, making the neuron less polarized or more positive, due to an influx of positively charged ions (mainly sodium ions, Na+) through voltage-gated ion channels. 3. Repolarization: The process whereby the membrane potential returns to its resting state after depolarization, due to the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels. Step 3: Identify the ion responsible for repolarization With the knowledge of the concepts mentioned in step 2, we can now identify the ion responsible for repolarization. Since repolarization is driven by the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels, it is the potassium ion (K+) that drives the membrane potential back to the resting membrane potential. Answer: The ion that drives the membrane potential back to resting membrane potential (repolarization) is the potassium ion (K+)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which farm likely has higher milk yields, farm A or B? A:","output":"To answer this question, we need to consider the differences in production methods between organic and non-organic dairy farms. Step 1: Understand the differences in production methods Organic dairy farms, like farm A, avoid the use of synthetic chemicals, antibiotics, GMOs, and growth hormones. They also have stricter animal welfare regulations and often require the cows to have more access to pasture. Non-organic dairy farms, like farm B, may use antibiotics, growth hormones, GMOs, and more conventional feed sources to optimize milk production. Step 2: Determine how these production methods might affect milk yields Antibiotics and growth hormones potentially can lead to increased milk yields in non-organic dairy farms. Non-organic farms may be more likely to optimize their feed and overall cow management for milk production. Organic farms, with their focus on natural practices, might prioritize cow health and welfare more than maximizing milk yields. Step 3: Make a conclusion based on the information provided Based on the differences in production methods and practices, it is likely that farm B, the non-organic dairy farm, would have higher milk yields than farm A, the organic dairy farm. This is because the techniques and management practices used in non-organic farming can lead to increased milk production compared to the more natural and restricted practices in organic farming."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is a news article: What man that you have heard or read about, living today in any part of the world, do you admire most? And who is your second choice? ||||| Sixth year in a row for Obama, 12th straight year for Clinton      PRINCETON, NJ -- For the sixth consecutive year, Barack Obama ranks as the Most Admired Man among Americans, and Hillary Clinton is again the Most Admired Woman. Both won by comfortable margins. Sixteen percent named Obama, compared with 4% each for former President George W. Bush and Pope Francis; Clinton (15%) finished ahead of television personality Oprah Winfrey (6%), first lady Michelle Obama (5%), and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (5%).      Each year, Gallup asks Americans to name, in an open-ended format, the man and woman living anywhere in the world they admire most. This year's poll was conducted Dec. 5-8.      Obama has won Gallup's Most Admired Man designation each year since 2008, the year he was elected president. However, similar to his declining job approval rating this year, the percentage naming him fell to 16% from 30% in 2012.      The remainder of the top 10 Most Admired men includes three former presidents (Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter) and two religious leaders (the Rev. Billy Graham and Pope Francis). The sitting pope has finished in the top 10 each year since 1977. In addition to Pope Francis, actor, director, and political activist Clint Eastwood and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz finished in the top 10 for the first time.      This year's poll was conducted at the time of South African human rights leader Nelson Mandela's death. The widespread news coverage of his death helped make him top of mind for many Americans, and 7% named him as Most Admired Man. However, because the question wording specifically asks for the name of a living man or woman, Gallup does not rank deceased figures who are mentioned.      Hillary Clinton has been named Most Admired Woman a total of 18 times, more than any other woman in Gallup's history, including each of the last 12 years. Clinton first won the distinction in 1993, when she was first lady, and has continued to rank at or near the top of the list while serving in a variety of public roles including as U.S. senator and as secretary of state. The 15% naming her this year is down from 21% last year and is the lowest figure for her since 2006.      The top 10 Most Admired Woman list includes several political leaders such as Clinton, Palin, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as humanitarian activists such as Winfrey, Malala Yousafzai (the Pakistani girl shot for trying to attend school), and Angelina Jolie. The queen of England and her granddaughter-in-law, Duchess Kate, also finished among the leading women. All of the women ranking in the top 10 have previously appeared on the list.      Graham, Queen Elizabeth II Extend Records for Top 10 Finishes      Graham has appeared in the top 10 list far more often than any other man, making his 57th appearance this year. He has never finished first, a spot typically taken by the sitting president, but has finished second on numerous occasions. Ronald Reagan has the second most top 10 finishes, but his 31 such finishes are 26 fewer than Graham's.      Carter's 28th top 10 finish this year moved him ahead of former Pope John Paul II for the third most top 10 appearances. Bill Clinton's 22nd top 10 spot ranks him fifth, now ahead of Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. Mandela frequently finished among the top 10, making his 20th and final top 10 appearance last year.      Gallup first asked Americans to name the Most Admired Woman in 1948. That year, Princess Elizabeth of England finished seventh. More than 60 years later, the now queen of England has finished in the top 10 a total of 46 times. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who died earlier this year, has the second most top 10 finishes among women, with 34. Former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis ranks third, followed by Winfrey and Clinton.      Implications      Clinton was named the Most Admired Woman this year for the 18th time. Unlike this year, each prior time she won she held an official government role. Her public service may not be complete, though, as she is frequently mentioned as a possible contender for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, and likely would be the clear front-runner if she decided to pursue it. She has dominated the Most Admired Woman list since becoming first lady in 1993, failing to finish first only in 1995 and 1996 to Mother Teresa, and in 2001 to Laura Bush.      It would not be surprising for Obama to continue to rank as the Most Admired Man for the duration of his presidency, as the sitting president has won the distinction 57 times in the 67 years the question has been asked, including the last 33 in a row. Given his relative youth at age 52, the esteem in which Americans hold former presidents, and his historical significance as the first African-American president, should he live a long life he likely will also rank among the men with the most top 10 appearances for all time. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were named the Most Admired Man and Woman among Americans for the sixth consecutive year according to a Gallup poll conducted in December 2013. Obama received 16% of the votes, while Clinton had 15%. The sitting US president typically takes the top position for Most Admired Man. Clinton has won the Most Admired Woman title 18 times, which is the most for any woman in the Gallup poll's history. Factors such as public roles and possible future political pursuits contribute to their continued admiration among Americans."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

It tells us that there is a significant gathering of people at a swap meet, and this particular event is taking place in a parking lot.

Although science has made big steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that 80 percent of all human illness are connected with diet and 40 percent of cancer is connected with the diet. Therefore, that food is connected with illness is not a new discovery. In 1940's scientists realized that nitrates , which are often used to keep color1 of meat, and other additives caused cancer. However these additives remain in our food and it becomes more difficult to know which additives are helpful or harmful. Farmers sometimes give drugs to animals not because the animals are ill but because they want to sell the animals at higher prices. For example, farmers try hard to make animals grow big so that they can sell the big animals for more money. Although the Food and Drug Administration has tried again and again to control farmers to do so, farmers go on doing this.

Trivia question: In Norse mythology what is the name of the hall to which the Valkyrie take their chosen warriors? And the answer is?","output":"In Norse mythology, the hall to which the Valkyries bring their chosen warriors is called Valhalla. Valhalla, meaning \\"hall of the slain,\\" is an enormous and majestic hall located in Asgard, the realm of the gods. It is primarily associated with the Norse god Odin, the All-Father, who rules over Asgard and is known for his wisdom, war abilities, and interest in the souls of heroic warriors who perish in battle. The Valkyries, a group of fierce female warriors, serve Odin and are responsible for selecting the bravest fallen warriors, known as the Einherjar. Upon their arrival in Valhalla, the chosen warriors are welcomed with great feasts and can partake in battle during the day if they so choose. They continue the cycle of fighting and feasting until the onset of Ragnarök, the end of the world, according to Norse mythology. When Ragnarök occurs, these legendary warriors will be summoned by Odin to join the gods in the final battle against the destructive forces and monstrous creatures determined to destroy the cosmos. As a central aspect of the Norse afterlife for warriors, Valhalla is held in high esteem. It is a symbol of honor and courage, as only exceptionally brave and skilled warriors are considered worthy of joining Odin and the Einherjar in this glorious afterworld. By selecting only the greatest warriors for Valhalla, Odin demonstrates his commitment to rewarding valor in battle and ensuring that this essential component of Norse culture remains alive beyond the mortal world. This belief in an extraordinary afterlife continues to captivate historians, scholars, and enthusiasts of Norse mythology, and it serves as a testament to the importance placed on the warrior ethos within this mesmerizing ancient society."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I was sold on the life-time warranty-after all, if a company is willing to replace a hose years after purchase it's got to be good, right? Wrong. The moment i connected the hose and turned the water on i got sprayed from head to toe with a rather strong stream of water coming from a sizable hole in the welded (or shall i say unwelded?) part of the connector. After i mopped myself up i examined the hose and found that the connector had 4 small pinholes along the seam.After having to empty a 100-ft hose, roll it up and ship it back to Amazon i e-mailed Gilmour to express my disappointment. Not surprisingly my e-mail was completely ignored. I have a 7-dollar hose bought on clearance at Rite Aid that's held up great for the last 6 years withou the need for life-time warranty. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? The answer to this question is:","output":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment. The review starts with a clear statement of dissatisfaction: \\"Very disappointing experience with a poor quality product.\\" The customer was initially attracted by the lifetime warranty but found the promise misleading once they encountered the faulty product. The two main issues which led to the negative sentiment were the product's quality and the company's customer service, both of which let the reviewer down. Firstly, the hose was of poor quality. Upon first use, the reviewer was sprayed with water from a sizable hole in the connector. Further inspection found 4 additional pinholes, heavily implying the product was not checked for defects before shipping. This clearly left the customer frustrated, especially considering they had to go through the hassle of emptying the hose, rolling it up and returning it. Secondly, their dissatisfaction was exacerbated by the company's lack of customer service. The customer's email expressing their disappointment was ignored by Gilmour, the company responsible for the product. This inaction further harmed the company's reputation in the eyes of the reviewer. Their dissatisfaction is further emphasized by comparing the defective hose to a 7 hose bought on clearance which has served them well for the past 6 years. The reviewer ends on a further negative note by casting doubt on the reality of the \\"lifetime warranty.\\" Considering the multiple glaring issues cited by the customer, both regarding the tangible product and intangible service, it is safe to conclude that this product review is heavily negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose third Benhardt play was La Tosca? from the following article ?  The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti.  Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini.  One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand... Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose third Bernhardt play was La Tosca is Sardou. Victorien Sardou was a French playwright who wrote a series of historical melodramas, including La Tosca, in collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt. La Tosca, which premiered on 24 November 1887, achieved outstanding success and was eventually adapted into Puccini's opera."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: (I) negative (II) positive","output":"The sentiment of the given tweet can be described as a subtle blend of positive and negative emotions, making it difficult to categorize in either option I (negative) or option II (positive) exclusively. The context of the tweet seems to be the differences in the weather or the atmosphere related to the geographical location of the person. Such a response to someone who might be expressing enjoyment of warm summer weather suggests that the speaker isn't experiencing that pleasant warmth in their location, which gives the tweet a slightly negative undertone. However, the tone of the tweet also presents some positive aspects. By using a casual, conversational tone and an exclamation mark, the tweet signifies a light-hearted, friendly rapport. The use of \\"yeah\\" and \\"maybe\\" in the message may also imply that the speaker isn't rejecting the other person's statement outright but is instead acknowledging its subjectivity. In conclusion, the sentiment of the tweet cannot be definitively categorized as either negative or positive based on the presented options.

Question: What preposition do you use if you want to combine two words? Options:  A. article  B. adjective  C. interjection  D. conjunction  E. pronoun Answer:","output":"The correct option to pick if you want to combine two words using a preposition is D. conjunction.  A conjunction is a part of speech that connects words, phrases, or clauses. It is used to coordinate and connect sentences or words smoothly, making the overall structure more comprehensible. Common examples of conjunctions include 'and', 'but', 'or', 'so', and 'yet'. They provide a relationship between ideas, making the text more coherent. Here's a brief description of the other options mentioned: A. Article: An article is a word used to modify or specify a noun. There are definite articles, such as \\"the\\", and indefinite articles, such as \\"a\\" or \\"an\\". Articles do not combine words; instead, they enable the reader to identify specific or unspecific nouns. B. Adjective: An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun. It provides additional information, such as color, size, or quantity, about the noun. Adjectives do not combine words; instead, they add details to make descriptions richer and more vivid. C. Interjection: An interjection is a short exclamation or utterance used to express emotion or reaction. These words usually stand alone and are not used to combine words or phrases. Examples include \\"Wow!\\", \\"Oh no!\\", and \\"Ugh!\\". E. Pronoun: A pronoun is a part of speech that replaces a noun in a sentence to prevent repetition of the noun and to simplify language. Examples of pronouns include 'he', 'she', 'it', 'they', 'we', and 'I'. While pronouns make sentences clearer and less repetitive, they do not function to combine words. In summary, the best option for combining two words using a preposition would be the conjunction, which enables a smooth connection between words, phrases, or clauses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Why wearable technology is the future of sex The network connects toys by accessing their existing technology (machine feedback, pressure sensors, clench and ripple attachments, vibration motors, etc) to give a simulated version of intimate acts from a distance. The founder (known only as Seth) claims the technology can ”honestly, no joke, change the world. It feels like the act of sex,” he told the Daily Mail. “While you're thrusting, I'm being penetrated. You're pushing back. I'm feeling the resistance.\\" And if that doesn't get you jumping straight in to a cold shower, check this out: Frixion should soon be hosting live mass cyber sessions, led by one ringmaster controlling thousands of people's devices with their movements. You could soon be having pseudo-sex with a porn star, if that's what toots your horn. Google Glass it aint. But then again, Google's optical head-mounted device has implications for your sex life, too, in the form of Glance, an app which allows users to experience sex from their partner's point of view. Yep, you'll soon be able to watch yourself having sex, in real-time. And you thought a “selfie stick” was bad. Elsewhere, hardware company Ravijour has deployed wearable sex tech for it's \\"True Love Tester.\\" Touted as “A revolutionary bra that knows how women truly feel,\\" the garment is fitted with a device that registers heart rate and send it via Bluetooth to an app which calculates to what degree your pulse starts racing when you spot a certain someone. Sure, for the emotionally incognisant, this could totally work. Particularly because when your pulse leads the device to declare you sufficiently loved-up, the bra pops open (because nothing inspires “true love” in a potential partner like an incapacitated underwire). At the more exoteric end of the spectrum is the wearable sex tech from Je Joue. Their G-spot and clitoral-focused Dua toy comes complete with its own discreet ballpoint pen-shaped remote for “partner-play” and an app to give your other half long-distance control over what your device is doing to you. Will Ranscombe, MD of Je Joue, explained, “We designed the Dua with couples in mind. We wanted to break away from the stereotype of sex toys for singletons by developing a toy that encouraged partner play. For us the obvious route was to create a toy that is controlled by your partner, allowing the other half to completely let go.” So what would he say to the argument that these days we pay more attention to our devices than our partners anyway, and surely this sort of app-based playing with wearable tech will push people further apart and increase our propensity to substitute technology for tangible intimacy? “The app is just a facilitator for encouraging interaction between couples,\\" Ranscombe says. \\"It's so simple to use, with swiping up and down and left and right to control, you need not even look at your iPhone whilst you're using it, you can focus purely on your partner and their reaction.” There's an historical precedence for all this, too. Sex has always been a crucial driver of technological innovation, from VHS players and camcorders to home answerphones (prostitutes were early adopters of home answering machines in the 1950s, argues historian David Morton). The younger generation are already on board. A survey conducted by the Center for Generational Kinetics and Wearables.com and published last month found that a quarter of millennials (individuals born between 1977 and 1995) were willing to wear some sort of wearable technology during sex. So if you're still not convinced, perhaps you're just too old for this sort of thing. Will Ranscombe is in no doubt that we'll continue to see a slew of technologies that connect people sexually and remotely. “You should see the weird and wacky ideas that are pitched to us involving cameras, vibrators, lasers, and robots on a daily basis,\\" he says. \\"But for us it has been, and always will be, about you and your partner sharing intimacy that is borne out of human experiences and not technology. If we can use technology to help this, then great, but for us technology will never replace it.”","output":"Wearable technology has been recognized as the future of sex, with innovative devices and apps offering new and interactive experiences for users. Products like Frixion are allowing users to simulate intimacy and even participate in mass cyber sessions with one person controlling thousands of devices, while apps like Glance for Google Glass enable couples to experience sex from their partner's perspective. Wearable tech for sex also comes in the form of Ravijour's \\"True Love Tester\\" bra, which is equipped with a heart rate monitor and a Bluetooth-enabled device that sends data to an app, gauging the wearer's attraction level. Je Joue's Dua toy, designed for couples, allows partners to control G-spot and clitoral stimulation devices from a distance via a discreet remote and accompanying app. A familiar argument against such technology is that it may push people apart and substitute technology for tangible intimacy, but the creators assert that these devices simply facilitate increased interaction between couples.

Background: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov (; Russian: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, pronounced [vla'djimjIr na'bok@f] ( listen), also known by the pen name Vladimir Sirin; 22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1899 - 2 July 1977) was a Russian-American novelist, translator and entomologist. Context: Nabokov was a classical liberal, in the tradition of his father, a liberal statesman who served in the Provisional Government following the February Revolution of 1917. Nabokov was a self-proclaimed \\"White Russian\\", and was, from its inception, a strong opponent of the Soviet government that came to power following the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. In a poem he wrote as a teenager in 1917, he described Lenin's Bolsheviks as \\"grey rag-tag people\\".  Throughout his life, Nabokov would remain committed to the classical liberal political philosophy of his father, and equally opposed Tsarist autocracy, communism and fascism.  Nabokov's father Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov was the most outspoken defender of Jewish rights in the Russian Empire, continuing in a family tradition that had been led by his own father, Dmitry Nabokov, who as Justice Minister under Tsar Alexander II had successfully blocked anti-semitic measures from being passed by the Interior Minister. That family strain would continue in Vladimir Nabokov, who fiercely denounced anti-semitism in his writings, and in the 1930s Nabokov was able to escape Hitler's Germany only with the help of Russian Jewish emigres who still had grateful memories of his family's defense of Jews in Tsarist times.  When asked, in 1969, whether he would like to revisit the land he had fled in 1918, now the Soviet Union, he replied: \\"There's nothing to look at. New tenement houses and old churches do not interest me. The hotels there are terrible. I detest the Soviet theater. Any palace in Italy is superior to the repainted abodes of the Tsars. The village huts in the forbidden hinterland are as dismally poor as ever, and the wretched peasant flogs his wretched cart horse with the same wretched zest. As to my special northern landscape and the haunts of my childhood - well, I would not wish to contaminate their images preserved in my mind.\\" Question: What else was interesting about his political views?. Whats the answer?","output":"Vladimir Nabokov's political views are interesting due to his firm stance as a classical liberal, which he maintained throughout his life, following in the footsteps of his father. As a self-proclaimed \\"White Russian,\\" he opposed not only the Soviet government and communism but also Tsarist autocracy and fascism, demonstrating his commitment to a balanced political philosophy. Furthermore, his family's strong tradition of advocating for Jewish rights, which started with his grandfather and continued through his father, also persisted in Nabokov's own vocal condemnation of anti-semitism in his writings. These various aspects of his political beliefs, particularly in the context of the historical events he lived through, make Nabokov's views compelling and distinct."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach - The stomach churns the food - With the aid of stomach acids - The food becomes a thick liquid - Is then passed to the small intestine.  Question: suppose food stays in stomach longer happens, how will it affect MORE digestion occuring.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"If the food stays in the stomach longer than it typically should, the impact on the digestion process can vary, but it will generally lead to more digestion occurring within the stomach. This would represent option A: more. To understand this effect, we need to explore the different aspects of the digestive process and how a prolonged stay in the stomach might influence them. 1. Gastric Acid Secretion: The stomach's primary function is to secrete gastric juices, including hydrochloric acid and enzymes like pepsin, to break down proteins and other food components. If food remains in the stomach for an extended period, more gastric juices are produced, which could lead to increased digestion of proteins and other macronutrients within the stomach. 2. Churning and Mixing: The stomach's muscular walls also aid in digestion by churning and mixing the food with gastric juices. By staying in the stomach longer, the food receives additional mixing and exposure to these digestive enzymes and acids, leading to further disintegration and digestion. 3. pH Balance: Different parts of the digestive system have unique pH levels to optimize digestive processes. In the stomach, a lower pH (higher acidity) is optimal for breaking down proteins. If food remains in the stomach for an extended period, it may lead to a more acidic environment, which could facilitate more digestion. On the other hand, one must also consider potential negative effects of prolonged food retention in the stomach: 1. Delayed Nutrient Absorption: The majority of nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine. A delay in the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine might lead to delayed nutrient absorption, which can cause nutritional deficiencies over time. 2. Reduced Appetite and Satiety: When food remains in the stomach for a longer duration, it can decrease appetite and cause a sensation of fullness, which might lead to reduced food intake and impact an individual's nutritional status. 3. Potential GI Issues: Prolonged food retention in the stomach may result from underlying gastrointestinal issues, such as gastroparesis, which could further compromise digestive functioning and overall health. In conclusion, if food stays in the stomach longer than usual, it will most likely result in more digestion occurring within the stomach due to increased gastric acid secretion and additional churning and mixing. However, this scenario could also have negative consequences, such as delayed nutrient absorption and potential gastrointestinal issues, thus emphasizing the importance of maintaining healthy digestion and addressing any underlying issues that may be causing prolonged food retention in the stomach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Afterward, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn that the June 12 summit in Singapore between him and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, was back on. Trump, however, sought to quell some of the high expectations, saying the summit would \\"be a beginning\\" and subsequent discussions were likely to be needed to get Pyongyang to agree to denuclearization. \\"We're not going to go in and sign something on June 12th, and we never were,\\" he said. \\"We're going to start a process.\\" Trump declared he \\"never said it happens in one meeting,\\" but that it \\"will ultimately be a successful process.\\" Asked by VOA News whether the North Koreans had committed to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization, Trump replied only that \\"we talked about a lot of things.\\" 'Take your time' The president said he told Kim Yong Chol, the former head of North Korean military intelligence, \\"Take your time. We can go fast. We can go slowly.\\" The president made clear that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted, however, until the country agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal. As the negotiations over the Singapore summit play out in public, there is a sense among some observers that Trump and Kim Jong Un each have a clear sense of the deal they ultimately want to strike. Less clear is whether the U.S. and North Korean visions can match up in any meaningful way. \\"Singapore might be the first time people will have to put their cards on the table,\\" a U.S. official said on the condition of anonymity. Upon his arrival Friday at the White House, Kim Yong Chol, who is under U.S. sanctions for links to cyberattacks against American companies, delivered a letter from Kim Jong Un. While Trump did not reveal the contents, he described the gesture as \\"very nice.\\" Why did Pres Trump say nothing would be signed on June 12th?

The stepmother of a 13-year-old boy who died after he was beaten and kept in a dog cage has been sentenced to 35 years in jail. Kimberly Kubina, 47, pleaded guilty to felony neglect over teenager Christian Choate’s death, whose severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana shortly after he was reported missing in May 2011. Kubina’s former husband Riley Choate, 40, of Hammond, Indiana was also sentenced to 80 years in prison last month. Kept in a dog cage: Kimberly Kubina (right) was sentenced to 35 years for the death of stepson Christian Choate (left) who was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died. Investigators said the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009. His disappearance went unreported until Lake County police unearthed his body in May, 2011 from a shallow grave. The Lake County Coroner's Office determined he died of blunt force trauma injuries and a skull fracture. Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson. She said that Choate was intimidating and violent and that she feared that the other children, including several nephews and nieces, she was looking after would be taken away by the welfare authorities. Father's son: Christian's father and Kubina's former husband Riley Choate was sentenced to 80 years in jail last month over his involvement in the boy's death. She said in court, according to the Chicago Sun-Times: ‘In our house, whatever Riley said was law.’ The woman told the judge that she. suffered nightmares about what had happened and that the other children,. who had seen the abuse, were emotionally scarred. Christian was kept in a dog cage and. Kubina told the court in May that she told his sister to only feed him. Asian noodles while locked up as punishment for 'molesting' his younger. step-brother. The. unidentified sister was not the only one to know about the horrible. suffering that the boy endured, and up to 13 people are thought to have. known about the torture without alerting the police. Court. records state that the father, Riley Choate, has admitted burying. Christian's body under a storage shed with a Bible across his chest but. denied causing the boy's death. Kubina, the stepmother, repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing, court and Indiana Department of Child Services records show. Originally, she told police she thought Christian had gone to live with his biological mother. Only. one person claims to have taken her concerns to the authorities,. according to the state's Department of Child Services records. Investigators. say the boy was beaten for several years and kept in a cage for as long. as a year before he died at the age of 13 in early 2009. Both Choate and Kubina had pleaded not guilty to all charges surrounding Christian’s death originally. Intimidating and violent: Kubina told the court: 'In our house, whatever Riley said was law,' after Christian's severely malnourished body was found in a shallow grave at a mobile home park in Gary, Indiana. Choate made a deal with prosecutors. to plead guilty to some charges in return for a lessened sentence and to. avoid a jury trial. He pleaded guilty to felony charges including. moving a body after death and neglect of a dependent causing death. In return for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped charges of murder, battery, criminal confinement and obstruction of justice. Choate. himself addressed the judge before learning his fate in January,. saying: 'All my actions will haunt me forever. I loved my son.' Kubina was given a similar deal for testifying against her former husband. Kubina's sister, Belinda Bradburn, told The Times she witnessed abuse once while visiting her sister and the children when they lived in Merrillville. She said she saw Riley Choate hit Christian in the arm. 'When that happened, I just said, \\"Kim, I'm leaving. This is kind of ridiculous that he would just hit a kid, and you need to do something about this\\",' Bradburn recalled. Body placement: Choate has admitted burying Christian's body under a storage shed. Kubina told the Lake Superior Court that she was remorseful for not stopping the abuse involving her stepson. In December MailOnline reported that Christian wrote letters from his squalid prison about how he wanted his life to end. He wrote: ‘I want to die’ on the paper given to him by his stepmother to scribble down how he felt. In the handwritten notes, he said he simply wanted to be liked by his family  - even if they were ‘abusing’ him. Christian writes how he had to steal food when he was hungry because his family allegedly would not feed him. He would only be let out to clean the house and was almost never allowed outside. ‘Christian wrote of why nobody liked him and how he just wanted to be liked by his family,’ DCS records state. ‘Christian stated that he wanted to die because nobody liked the way he 'acted.' The records continue: 'Christian's writings detail a very sad, depressed child who often wondered when someone, anyone, was going to come check on him and give him food or liquid. Christian often stated he was hungry or thirsty.’","output":"A tragic case involving the death of a 13-year-old boy has led to the sentencing of his stepmother and father.

A:","output":"The last Land Rover Defender, retaining its iconic design that had stayed recognizable for decades, rolled off the production line on January 29, 2016 at the Solihull plant in West Midlands, UK. This event marked the end of an era as the Defender has been an influential part of the automotive industry with its uniquely rugged and robust design. The Defender's journey began 67 years earlier, as a post-war project at the Rover Company, with the launch of the \\"Land Rover\\" concept at the Amsterdam Motor Show in 1948. The concept was envisioned as a utility vehicle for farmers, perfectly incarnating strength and durability. Over the years, this vehicle became popular worldwide as the \\"Land Rover Series\\", and it was widely known for its versatile capabilities including agricultural purposes, exploration tours, military utilization and even in royal households. In 1983 however, the Land Rover Series was renamed the 'Defender' to represent its abilities robustly. This rugged off-roader seemed immune to the passage of time and maintained its production, although with various upgrades and tweaks, largely due to its go-anywhere competency and durability. Across the UK and abroad, it was frequently seen as police cars, ambulances, expedition vehicles, and even school buses. However, tightening emission and safety regulations worldwide made it increasingly difficult for Land Rover to comply with these standards without altering the Defender’s trademark design and functionality. As a result, Land Rover decided to make a profound decision by ending its production after almost seven decades, in 2016. This iconic 4x4 vehicle was commemorated by Land Rover by creating three limited editions called Autobiography, Heritage, and Adventure. The final production model was a Defender 90 Heritage Soft Top, painted in a distinctive 'Grasmere Green' and having a soft-top design. Although the original Defender production ceased in 2016, Land Rover introduced a completely redesigned version of the Defender in 2020 that combines modern aesthetics with the rugged functionality of the original, marking a new chapter in the Defender's history. The new model incorporates advanced technology and redesigned features, while still retaining a sense of nostalgia and cultural heritage closely associated with the iconic Defender lineage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is unique in that it is a sport where able and disabled persons, and people as young as 5 years and as old as 80 years of age can participate alongside each other. It is a sport that involves more than one person, and is a wonderful family activity that gathers members together for a day of fun at a favorite waterway. Anyone who has put on water skis can attest to its health benefits--it is a sport that demands and develops strength, agility and endurance. The sport includes several disciplines  including slalom, tricks, cable, jump, ski racing, kneeboard, wakeboard, and barefoot, with each of these practiced for either recreational or competitive enjoyment. Safety Tips for Water-Skiers Don't take unnecessary risks while water-skiing. The following tips will help you safely enjoy this thrilling sport: ALWAYS have an observer in the boat. This is a legal requirement in many states. The boat driver cannot watch the skier and operate the boat safely at the same time. ALWAYS wear a Coast Guard approved Personal Flotation Device (PFD) designed for water skiing. Ski belts are NOT recommended. Your approved PFD will help keep you afloat. NEVER ski in rough water. High waves or a choppy sea will prevent the tow boat from maintaining a steady course and speed. NEVER ski after dark. It is dangerous AND illegal. Any boat traveling fast enough to tow a skier is traveling too fast to navigate safely at night. NEVER water-ski while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Such activity is extremely dangerous because of the impairment to your judgment and ability to respond. A recent study conducted with expert skiers who were purposely drunk indicated that even their ability to ski was dramatically reduced. Use hand signals between the skier and observer. Agree before you start what each signal means so there is no confusion at a critical moment. Question: The purpose of the article is to  _  .

Context: As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship. As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more. And like every great ride, Julie was beautiful, fast, and could turn on a dime in the blink of an eye. \\"I don't understand, Dingo.\\" I couldn't tell if it was the 12 stitches over my eye giving me the headache or Julie's prattling. I bit off a stretch of red tape and put it over the empty socket where my taillight should have been while I balanced the phone between my shoulder and swollen cheek. \\"Julie, I told you. Darby took the box.\\" \\"I get that, but--.\\" \\"The box my dad hand-carved just before he died.\\" I could feel the two edges of skin stitched together pull at each other every time my jaw moved. \\"Yes, yes, and the box protects your family's dirty little secret or your mother's pride and joy or whatever the hell it is you're calling it this week.\\" \\"Hey, I told you not to go digging--. \\" \\"I don't care what it is, Dingo! I couldn't give a shit about that damn box or what's inside. The only thing I want to know is what the fuck your ex-wife was doing there.\\" So there it was. And I thought she was jealous just because somebody else got to beat the living crap out of me for a change. \\"Julie, I didn't even know she was in town until after I was in the hospital.\\" Question: Who character thought to be annoing? Answer: Answer:","output":"In this context, the character perceived to be annoying is Julie. The speaker, presumably Dingo, finds her barrage of questions to be irritating and headache-inducing. This is evident from his thoughts and feelings expressed throughout the narrative, describing their relationship primarily based on physical attraction with a distinct lack of emotional or intellectual connection, especially evidenced when he calls their conversations \\"prattling\\". Furthermore, his exasperation is highlighted when he mentions trying to maintain a conversation while juggling other tasks, suggesting that Julie's incessant inquiries add to his stress.  Dingo even goes so far as to express a desire for a \\"normal, healthy relationship\\", emphasizing the element of dissatisfaction he experiences with the current dynamics with Julie. At multiple instances, he attempts to shut down the conversation or deflect Julie's queries, indicating his frustration and annoyance. Moreover, while Julie's desire to understand the situation and her concerns about Dingo's ex-wife's presence are legitimate, her approach and timing, as described in this story, are perceived as bothersome by Dingo. Finally, there is a thematic indicator of annoyance in the narrative; Dingo experiences physical discomfort or pain as he communicates with Julie, implying that her constant questions are an irritant. His annoyance at Julie is compounded by his physical state, with the '12 stitches over his eye' and the 'pull at each other every time his jaw moved,' indirectly associating the pain he's suffering with his interactions with her. In sum, within this context, Julie is depicted as the character that Dingo perceives as annoying."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: Designer and TV host Nate Berkus is a member of the American Red Cross Celebrity Cabinet, which helps to highlight the organization's initiatives and response efforts. Founded in 1881, the American Red Cross is part of a worldwide movement that offers humanitarian care to victims of war and natural disasters. Berkus recently spoke with CNN's Allie Torgan about his personal connection to the Red Cross and how he is giving back. Below are excerpts from that interview. Allie Torgan: Why are you involved with the Red Cross? Nate Berkus: I have a very personal connection to the Red Cross because when I survived the tsunami -- the Indian Ocean tsunami, which was seven years ago now -- the Swiss Red Cross was the first sign of help that I saw with my own eyes. The sad part for me was that my partner, who I was traveling with to a tiny surfing village in Sri Lanka, didn't survive ... like many, many other people. And it was really an eye-opening experience for me ... and a soul-opening experience for me because I think we really don't know who we are until we don't have the resources that we need. Torgan: How did that experience affect you? Berkus: For me, having survived a natural disaster of that magnitude, there are things that happen that you don't even think about. Sometimes you just need a pair of flip-flops so that your feet aren't cut as you're walking around in the debris. Sometimes you need the equivalent of 5 in foreign currency to make a phone call to tell the people that love you you're OK or that somebody you love is not OK. And sometimes you need somebody just to give you a pencil and a piece of paper so that you can write down important details ... things that are flying through your mind like your passport number. I went through a very long period of grief and also sort of re-acclimating myself to what the reality of my life was. Torgan: What is your role as a member of the Celebrity Cabinet? Berkus: The main goal for me is to raise awareness of what the Red Cross does. I think especially at this time of the year, we all have so many holiday traditions. ... And if one of those traditions as families could be to volunteer or donate blood to the Red Cross as part of everything that we take for granted in this season, it would be really amazing. That kind of thinking is what being on the Celebrity Cabinet is all about. And obviously with the visibility that I'm lucky enough to have -- having a daily talk show and being able to meet people all across the country -- it's a way for me to give back to an organization that gave me something when I didn't have anything. Torgan: Why are you involved in the CNN Heroes campaign? Berkus: I think the Heroes campaign is really great because it highlights everyday people that we relate to, and it brings them to a place where they're getting recognition. But even as you're watching, you know that the recognition is not what they are after. What they're after was the deed that they chose to do. There's so much on TV ... so much passive, yucky stuff that just fills our brain with things that don't inspire us at all. And to watch somebody doing something for somebody else -- completely selflessly, having no idea that they would be chosen by CNN to be a Hero -- is something that's worthwhile for everyone to watch. Highlights:","output":"1. Nate Berkus is a member of the American Red Cross Celebrity Cabinet, which helps the organization. 2. He has a personal connection because the Swiss Red Cross helped him when he survived the tsunami in the Indian Ocean. 3. Nate wants to raise awareness about the Red Cross and inspire people to help, like donating blood or volunteering. 4.

He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all.

Given the context: What will happen to Jan? Answer:","output":"Without knowing the specific movie title or plot, I can only provide a general analysis based on the provided information. Throughout the movie, it seems that Carson, a significant character, has been leading Jan through various life experiences. The relationship between Carson and Jan seems to play a critical role in Jan's personal development, and the class that watched the movie likely did so with a particular lesson or moral in mind. Given this context, several different outcomes are possible for Jan, depending on the nature of their relationship with Carson, the overall premise of the movie, and the intended takeaway for the class: 1. Positive outcome: If the movie aims to convey a message about the importance of mentorship or guidance, Jan may find great success and happiness due to Carson's influence. Carson might play the role of a role model or life coach, providing valuable support and wisdom at crucial points in Jan's life. In this case, the students would learn about the transformative power of friendship, mentorship, or guidance in overcoming life's challenges. 2. Lessons through adversity: In contrast, if the movie's focus is on self-discovery or personal growth, Jan might ultimately realize that they cannot rely solely upon Carson's guidance to lead them through life. Jan may face a turning point where they need to make a difficult decision or confront a challenge independently in order to truly grow and mature. In this case, the students would learn about the importance of self-reliance, autonomy, and the value of learning from mistakes or hardships. 3. Bittersweet outcome: The movie could also explore themes of loss or change, with Jan having to navigate life without Carson due to a tragic event, separation, or other circumstances. In this scenario, Jan would need to learn to apply what they have learned from their relationship with Carson to their own life, as they now embark on a journey of self-discovery and growth. This outcome would teach students about resilience, adaptability, and the power of memories in shaping one's identity. 4. Unexpected or open-ended outcome: The movie could leave Jan's fate uncertain or open-ended, allowing the viewers to interpret the story and the lessons learned in their own way. This type of ending could invite class discussion and debate about the implications of the story, allowing students to draw from their own experiences and perspectives when making meaning of the film. Regardless of the movie's specific outcome, the fact that the class students watched it implies that there is a valuable lesson or message for them to explore, discuss, and learn from. By examining Jan's experiences and the role that Carson plays in their life, students can gain a deeper understanding of human relationships, personal development, and the various challenges and triumphs that one might encounter throughout life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film flashes back years earlier. As the alcoholic and abusive farmer, Mr. Jones (Pete Postlethwaite), struggles with debt to neighbor farmer Mr. Pilkington, Old Major (Peter Ustinov), the oldest pig at Manor Farm, holds a meeting with the animals in the barn. Old Major tells the animals that mankind is their enemy, for they serve and provide for mankind without reward. Old Major teaches the animals the song, \\"Beasts of the World,\\" which proclaims that animals must overthrow man in order to be free and equal. The meeting is interrupted when Jones stumbles outside the barn and accidentally fires his gun, killing Old Major. When Jones neglects to feed the animals, Boxer (Paul Scofield), the work horse, leads the animals to the food shed, and the pigs lead a revolution against Jones, his wife, and the farm workers, forcing them off the property. Under the rule of animals, Manor Farm is renamed Animal Farm by Snowball (Kelsey Grammer), a pig who has learned to read and write. Snowball paints on the barn doors what he calls the seven commandments of Animalism, which, in accordance with Old Major's views, forbid animals from behaving like humans or killing other animals. The final commandment reads, \\"All animals are equal.\\" Snowball teaches the animals to chant, \\"Four legs good, two legs bad\\" and also reveals the \\"Hoof and Horn,\\" a flag that represents Animal Farm.

Don’t look for a boyfriend or a relationship to make you feel wanted or valued—it’s a recipe for disaster. The more confident you are in yourself, the more compelling you’ll be to your boyfriend and to other people in general. Humans are quite good at sensing when people are insecure or inauthentic, and it tends to be a universal detractor. It will inevitably leave you unsatisfied because no one else can truly make you feel valued—that’s something only you can do. If you place a significant amount of your self-worth in a relationship, you’re entrusting your value to something that isn’t about you—relationships are about two people learning to be, yes, in a relationship with each other. It not only doesn’t make sense to see a relationship as a reflection of your own worth, it will ultimately backfire and leave you irrationally dependent on another person for your sense of self. Though he can and hopefully will provide supplemental love and support, he can’t—and shouldn’t—carry the weight of all your physical and emotional needs.

Information:  - A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other. The first powered, controlled aeroplane to fly, the Wright Flyer, used a biplane wing arrangement, as did many aircraft in the early years of aviation. While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more drag than a similar unbraced or cantilever monoplane wing. Improved structural techniques, better materials and the quest for greater speed made the biplane configuration obsolete for most purposes by the late 1930s.  - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX.  - Hawker Aircraft Limited was a British aircraft manufacturer responsible for some of the most famous products in British aviation history.  - Sir Sydney Camm, CBE, FRAeS (5 August 189312 March 1966) was an English aeronautical engineer who contributed to many Hawker aircraft designs, from the biplanes of the 1920s to jet fighters. One particularly notable aircraft he designed is the Hawker Hurricane fighter.  - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - The Hawker Hart was a British two-seater biplane light bomber aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was designed during the 1920s by Sydney Camm and manufactured by Hawker Aircraft. The Hart was a prominent British aircraft in the inter-war period, but was obsolete and already side-lined for newer monoplane aircraft designs by the start of the Second World War, playing only minor roles in the conflict before being retired.  - The Hawker Fury was a British biplane fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air Force in the 1930s . It was a fast , agile aircraft , and holds the distinction of being the first interceptor in RAF service to be capable of more than 200 MPH . The Fury is the fighter counterpart to the Hawker Hart light bomber .  - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.

The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).

When Transportation Security Administration officials don't follow the agency's rules, getting through the airport with the gear -- and a baby -- gets more difficult. A breast-feeding incident that has had TSA critics buzzing since last week was addressed in an apologetic blog post Thursday from the agency's \\"Blogger Bob\\" Burns. The controversy started when an agent at Kauai's Lihue Airport in Hawaii wouldn't allow passenger Amy Strand to board a plane February 29 with her breast pump because the milk bottles were empty, CNN affiliate KITV-TV in Honolulu reported. As a result Strand used her electric breast pump in a public airport restroom to fill the bottles and get them through security. She was traveling with her 9-month-old daughter, Eva. \\"I had to stand in front of the mirrors and the sinks and pump my breast, in front of every tourist that walked into that bathroom,\\" Strand told KITV. TSA admitted its agent made a mistake shortly afterward, saying in a statement: \\"We accept responsibility for the apparent misunderstanding and any inconvenience or embarrassment this incident may have caused her. The officer in question is receiving remedial training.\\" Burns, the TSA blogger, announced Thursday that the agency has updated its website \\"to help clarify the procedures for traveling with ice packs, breast milk, juice, and water.\\" The policy explained on the site now explicitly says that ice packs and empty bottles are permitted through security. \\"Mistakes such as this happen from time to time and for that we are truly sorry,\\" Burns wrote. \\"However, we can and have learned from mistakes in the past, so please be sure to let us know when you think or know something could have been handled differently.\\" Burns advised passengers to ask for a supervisor in uncomfortable situations or to call TSA customer service numbers listed in his post -- 866-289-9673 and 855-787-2227. Commenters on Burns' post weren't all satisfied with his advice. One said: \\"1) It has been frequently reported that TSA staff do not care whether or not something has been clearly stated on the website when they are imposing their own understanding of the rules; 2) It has been frequently reported that polite requests to speak with supervisors are treated as defiant behavior.\\" Those comments may refer to a 2010 incident involving a breast-feeding mother that resulted in a lawsuit against the TSA and Department of Homeland Security. According to the suit, Stacey Armato was traveling with breast milk for her 7-month-old son and requested alternate screening for the milk at a Phoenix International Airport checkpoint to avoid X-ray exposure. The suit says the same TSA agents she had encountered in the security line at the airport the week before retaliated against her for filing a complaint when her request for alternate screening for her breast milk in that instance met with resistance. The suit alleges that on her second encounter with the agents, Armato was directed to a \\"special inspection\\" area, where her requests to speak to a manager were refused. A uniformed police officer was also called in, according to court filings. Armato is suing on grounds of intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and false imprisonment. The suit alleges that screeners initially refused to review a printout that Armato provided of TSA guidelines pertaining to breast milk. The TSA said it sent a letter of apology to Armato shortly afterward. Despite some less-than-smooth incidents, many breast-feeding mothers pass through security with no trouble. One woman who said she's a nursing mother and hasn't had any trouble with security commented on the Strand incident: \\"Like several have said, this is not representative of TSA as an agency, but the stupidity of that particular agent.\\" Breast-feeding moms, what are your experiences of traveling while nursing? Please share your comments below. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Traveling while breastfeeding can pose challenges, especially when faced with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) rules at airports.

Translate to English","output":"The sentence, \\"Nehýbej se, Anno,\\" is in Czech, and its English translation is \\"Don't move, Anna.\\" This sentence is a directive or an instruction given to a person named Anna, indicating that she should not change her position or remain still. The Czech language is a Slavic language primarily spoken in the Czech Republic. As with other translations, it is essential to consider possible cultural, contextual, and idiomatic differences to convey the intended meaning accurately. For example, this sentence could be heard in a variety of situations: 1. In a game of hide-and-seek, where a player named Anna tries to remain unseen, and someone else suggests that she stay still to avoid being found. 2. During a medical examination or a procedure where staying still is of importance, the healthcare professional may ask Anna not to move for safety and accuracy in the process. 3. When a photographer wants a person named Anna to hold a particular pose for a picture, the photographer might instruct her to not move. Translating and understanding the phrase in different contexts allows English speakers to have a clearer comprehension of the situation and the speaker's intention.

He ruled the Principality of Halych from 1188 until 1189/1190, and again between 1208/1209 and 1210. He was the younger son of Béla III of Hungary, who entrusted him with the administration of the newly conquered Principality of Halych in 1188. Andrew's rule was unpopular, and the boyars expelled him. Béla III willed property and money to Andrew, obliging him to lead a crusade to the Holy Land. Instead, Andrew forced his elder brother, King Emeric of Hungary, to cede Croatia and Dalmatia as an appanage to him in 1197. The following year, Andrew occupied Hum.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - Barcelona is the capital city of the autonomous community of Catalonia in the Kingdom of Spain, as well as the country's second most populous municipality, with a population of 1.6 million within city limits. Its urban area extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 4.7 million people, being the sixth-most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, London, Madrid, the Ruhr area and Milan. It is the largest metropolis on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is high.  - San Marino, officially the Republic of San Marino, also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, is an enclaved microstate surrounded by Italy, situated on the Italian Peninsula on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains. Its size is just over , with a population of 33,562. Its capital is the City of San Marino and its largest city is Dogana.

Because of the recent conquest of Sicily by Peter, the Pope declared a crusade against him and officially deposed him as king, on the grounds that Sicily was a papal fief: Peter's grandfather and namesake, Peter II, had surrendered the kingdom as a fief to the Holy See. Martin bestowed Aragon on Charles, Count of Valois, son of the French king, Philip III, and nephew of Peter III.   - Ciociaria is an area of Central Italy roughly corresponding to the province of Frosinone, but without a defined border nor historical identity. The name was adopted by a fascist movement of Frosinone as an ethnical denomination for the province of Frosinone, when it was created in 1927. In the Middle Ages, this region was referred to as \\"Campagna\\". The local dialect, now known as \\"ciociaro\\", was earlier referred to as \\"campanino\\". In more recent times, the term \\"Campagna Romana\\", or Roman Campagna, a favorite subject of countless painters from all over Europe, has referred to the adjoining region to the north of \\"Ciociaria\\", but part of the Province of Rome.  - The Crown of Aragon was a composite monarchy, also nowadays referred to as a confederation of individual polities or kingdoms ruled by one king, with a personal and dynastic union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona. At the height of its power in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Crown of Aragon was a thalassocracy (a state with primarily maritime realms) controlling a large portion of present-day eastern Spain, parts of what is now southern France, and a Mediterranean \\"empire\\" which included the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia, Malta, Southern Italy (from 1442) and parts of Greece (until 1388). The component realms of the Crown were not united politically except at the level of the king, who ruled over each autonomous polity according to its own laws, raising funds under each tax structure, dealing separately with each \\"Corts\\" or \\"Cortes\\". Put in contemporary terms, it has sometimes been considered that the different lands of the Crown of Aragon (mainly the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Valencia) functioned more as a confederation than as a single kingdom. In this sense, the larger Crown of Aragon must not be confused with one of its constituent parts, the Kingdom of Aragon, from which it takes its name.  - Sardinia ( / , Sassarese: \\"Sardhigna\\", Gallurese: \\"Saldigna\\", Catalan: \\"Sardenya\\", Tabarchino: \\"Sardegna\\") is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea (after Sicily and before Cyprus) and an autonomous region of Italy.

The treaty was signed at Tarascon, halfway between papal Avignon and Arles, on 19 February 1291, six years after Philip's uncle, Charles of Valois, tried to conquer Aragón from Alfonso's father, Peter III of Aragon, in an event called the Aragonese Crusade because it was sanctioned by Nicholas' predecessor, Pope Martin IV. The intent of the signatories in putting an end to hostilities was to prevent Aragonese domination of Sicily, then ruled by Alfonso's brother, James II.   - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot).

His long reign -the longest of any Iberian monarch- saw the expansion of the House of Aragon in three directions: Languedoc to the north, the Balearic Islands to the south, and Valencia to the southwest. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he wrested the county of Barcelona from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown. His part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia.  - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest.

France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Latium is the region of central western Italy in which the city of Rome was founded and grew to be the capital city of the Roman Empire. Latium was originally a small triangle of fertile, volcanic soil on which resided the tribe of the Latins or Latians. It was located on the left bank (east and south) of the Tiber river, extending northward to the Anio river (a left-bank tributary of the Tiber) and southeastward to the Pomptina Palus (Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields) as far south as the Circeian promontory. The right bank of the Tiber was occupied by the Etruscan city of Veii, and the other borders were occupied by Italic tribes. Subsequently, Rome defeated Veii and then its Italic neighbors, expanding Latium to the Apennine Mountains in the northeast and to the opposite end of the marsh in the southeast. The modern descendant, the Italian \\"Regione\\" of Lazio, also called \\"Latium\\" in Latin, and occasionally in modern English, is somewhat larger still, but not as much as double the original Latium.  - While the medieval Angevin Kingdom of Albania was a monarchy, it did not encompass the entirety of the modern state of Albania. The latter has been a kingdom on two occasions. The first time was after it declared independence in 1912.  - Perpignan is a city, a commune, and the capital of the Pyrénées-Orientales department in south-western France. Perpignan was the capital of the former province and County of Roussillon (\\"Rosselló\\" in Catalan) and continental capital of the Kingdom of Majorca in the 13th and 14th centuries.  - Naples (Neapolitan: \\"Napule\\" or ;  meaning \\"new city\\") is the capital of the Italian region Campania and the third-largest municipality in Italy, after Rome and Milan. In 2015, around 975,260 people lived within the city's administrative limits. The Metropolitan City of Naples had a population of 3,115,320. Naples is the 9th-most populous urban area in the European Union with a population of between 3 million and 3.7 million. About 4.4 million people live in the Naples metropolitan area, one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea.  - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world.  - The Count of Barcelona was the ruler of Catalonia for much of Catalan history, from the 9th until the 15th century. The County of Barcelona was created by Charlemagne after he had conquered lands north of the river Ebro. These lands, called the \\"Marca Hispanica\\", were partitioned into various counties, of which the Count of Barcelona, usually holding other counties simultaneously, eventually obtained the primacy over the region.  - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant.

Simon said that he did not immediately realize the magnitude of the event: \\"I didn't get what had happened – how big it was – until I went home, turned on the television and saw it on all the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers. Then I got it.\\"In May 1982, Simon & Garfunkel went on a world tour with stops in Japan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, the US and Canada. The European leg of their tour began on May 28, 1982, at the Stadion am Bieberer Berg in Offenbach am Main. This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon & Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled Think Too Much, with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&G album was cancelled. Thus Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which then became Simon's November 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.Several years would pass before Simon & Garfunkel worked together again. Their next joint public appearance was in 1990, when they performed for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. When Simon gave another free concert in Central Park on August 15, 1991, he rejected Garfunkel's offer to participate. However, they agreed to perform together in 1993 for 21 sold out concerts in New York, with half of the show being Paul Simon solo with a band and the other half Simon and Garfunkel.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards was the longest rushing play?","output":"Title: The Longest Rushing Play in History: Athletes Who Defied the Odds Introduction The world of professional American Football has witnessed some truly riveting moments and notable records over the years. From spectacular touchdowns and incredible comebacks to jaw-dropping statistics, fans have been consistently entertained by the athletes' prowess and determination on the field. Among the many records, one that particularly stands out is the accomplishment of having the longest rushing play in the history of the National Football League (NFL). In this article, we will delve into the details of this magnificent feat, explore the astounding athletes who achieved it, and relive the excitement surrounding this record-breaking moment. The Longest Rushing Play in NFL History: Who and When? The record for the longest rushing play in NFL history is a staggering 99 yards, and it has been achieved on not just one, but two separate occasions. First, the record was set on January 3, 1983, during the game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Minnesota Vikings. The legendary Tony Dorsett, a running back for the Cowboys, stunned the world with an unbelievable 99-yard run from scrimmage to score a touchdown. This electrifying moment took place during the Monday Night Football broadcast; it has since become one of the most unforgettable plays of all time. Decades later, Derrick Henry, a running back representing the Tennessee Titans, matched this seemingly unattainable record on December 6, 2018, in a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. With the whole world watching, fans and sports pundits couldn't believe their eyes when Henry replicated Dorsett's epic achievement. A Closer Look at the 99-Yard Rushing Play In Tony Dorsett's case, the Cowboys were starting from their one-yard line, with a near-ideal formation that comprised only 10 players on the field at the time. Dorsett received the handoff from his quarterback, burst through the middle, eluded several defenders, and sprinted the remaining yards to the end zone. This performance has been lauded not only for its historical significance but also for its sheer athleticism displayed by Dorsett. Fast forward to 2018, when Derrick Henry equally captured the world's attention with his 99-yard rushing play. The Titans were also backed up near their end zone, just like the Cowboys in 1983. Henry took the handoff from the two-yard line, quickly broke through the defensive line, and then displayed his exceptional speed and power as he shed numerous tackles during his sprint down the field. His touchdown, like Dorsett’s, was the perfect combination of athleticism and remarkable determination. The Significance of This Astonishing Feat Achieving a 99-yard rushing play is an incredibly rare occurrence, as it requires multiple factors to align in sync. The offensive line must provide a solid opening, while the running back must display both the speed and power to break through the defense and maintain control down the length of the field. Moreover, this miraculous play is only possible when the team's offense is backed up to the one or two-yard line. The fact that only two players in all of NFL history have managed to pull off this remarkable accomplishment is a testament to the sheer difficulty of the task. This record further solidifies the legacy of these athletes, Tony Dorsett and Derrick Henry, who have earned their place among the greatest football players of all time. Conclusion The 99-yard rushing play stands as one of the most extraordinary achievements in the history of professional American Football. With only two instances occurring over the span of several decades, the record demonstrates the exceptional combination of skill, athleticism, and determination that these two phenomenal athletes, Tony Dorsett and Derrick Henry, exhibited. Whether a die-hard football fan or a casual enthusiast, one cannot help but appreciate the sheer brilliance of these rare, record-breaking moments that have captured the hearts and imagination of fans worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
