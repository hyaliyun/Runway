Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"Partially correct. While it is true that Bernie Madoff operated a Ponzi scheme which he claimed had started in the early 1990s, the answer does not provide sufficient information about what he was selling. Bernie Madoff, the founder of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, was selling what appeared to be an investment opportunity with consistently high returns. He attracted investors by promising unusually stable and consistent returns, which were not affected by market fluctuations. The investment opportunity he presented was related to his market-making and proprietary trading businesses, as well as investment advisory services. In reality, Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme, one of the largest and most infamous financial frauds in history. Instead of investing clients' funds as promised, he used the money from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, creating the illusion of a successful and profitable business. This fraudulent activity went undetected for years as Madoff fabricated account statements to deceive both the investors and regulatory authorities. To better answer the question, what Bernie Madoff was selling can be described as a false investment opportunity based on the illusion of consistent high returns, fueled by a massive Ponzi scheme that lasted for decades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War (German: Deutsch-Französischer Krieg, lit. German-French War, French: Guerre franco-allemande, lit. Franco-German War), often referred to in France as the War of 1870 (19 July 1870 – 10 May 1871), was a conflict between the Second French Empire and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification. Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck planned to provoke a French attack in order to draw the southern German states—Baden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt—into an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded.

Write a summary based on this article: Ashleigh Parker was in line to vote on Tuesday when she noticed a man in front of her wearing a T-shirt with a Confederate flag, the image of a noose, and the words “Mississippi Justice.”      Rashaud’s post quickly began attracting comments and shares. He also shared the photo with a friend who posted it on Twitter , where it quickly went viral after the friend added an incorrect claim that the man in the shirt was a poll worker. (Rashaud told BuzzFeed News he initially thought the man worked at the polling station, but later said he was mistaken. Parker also confirmed the man was a voter.)      “When I saw him I wanted to say something, but my mom was like, ‘Don’t say anything,’ so I took a picture and posted it on Facebook,” Rashaud told BuzzFeed News by phone. (He asked not to be identified by his full name because of safety concerns. He later deleted his Facebook post.)      Parker watched the man walk over to what she said was a voting machine, and at that moment another voter who was disgusted by what they saw began taking photos.      “It was racist and terrible and I hoped no one saw it. I wish I had said something but I held my tongue because I didn’t want to give him any attention,” she later wrote in a Facebook post about what she saw.      Rashaud said it was shocking to see someone wearing that shirt, especially in a polling station.      “It’s crazy — they try to say the rebel flag is not racist, but to have a noose on the rebel flag, it’s like, what are you trying to say?” Rashaud said. “It just shocks me that people feel it’s OK to come out in public like this. I was just kind of shook up.”      As the photo spread, people began identifying the man as Clayton John Hickey, a registered nurse who works at a hospital in Memphis and lives in Olive Branch, Mississippi, where the photo was taken. Public records confirm Hickey is an RN, and that he lives in Olive Branch.      BuzzFeed News spoke to three people who said they recognized Hickey in the photo. One is a former coworker, one currently works with Hickey at the same hospital, and another interacted with Hickey because he works for the fire department in Memphis.      “I work for the Fire Department and I have dropped off several patients with him,” the man told BuzzFeed News in a Facebook message. (He asked to not be identified due to the fact that he could face discipline for speaking to the media without permission.)      “I wasn’t at the polling place, but I know for certain that’s him,” said a former coworker, who asked not to be named due to concerns that it could affect her employment.      The person who said they currently work with Hickey said he’s employed at Regional One Health. The hospital confirmed this to BuzzFeed News, and said it was aware of the photo and was investigating. A day later, it announced on Twitter that Hickey had been fired.      \\"As of today, November 8, 2018, we have completed our investigation and what we learned led to the termination of the employee in question. Regional One Health holds employees to a high standard,\\" read one tweet.      The hospital said it's committed to \\"fostering a safe and protected work and care environment for all. Behaviors contrary to these principles are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\\"      Prior to becoming a nurse, Hickey was a Memphis police officer. He left that job after being arrested in Olive Branch in 2010 and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was found with a 17-year-old girl and open alcohol. (It’s unclear what the outcome of the case was.)            Though a few old news articles can be found about that incident, Hickey appears to have made a concerted effort in 2011 to place positive press releases, slideshows, and other references to himself on multiple websites. This is a common approach used by people to improve their online reputation.            Some press release and slideshow titles include, “Clayton Hickey Is A Brave Person,” “Clayton Hickey Memphis Police – Awarded Employee Of The Month In 2000,” “Clayton Hickey Memphis Police Is A Black Belt Winner,” and “Clayton Hickey Memphis Police Loves Sports.”            There’s also a Clayton Hickey Twitter account that a former coworker of his shared with BuzzFeed News, and which was used to promote links to the reputation-enhancing articles.      Hickey did not respond to two emails sent to an an address found online for him, or to a phone message left at a number he previously listed in a domain name registration. (Phone numbers listed for him in public records were disconnected.)            In her Facebook post, Parker said her two sons were with her at the polling station when she saw the shirt.      “We talked about it on the way home, my big boys saw it and were equally offended,” she said. “Heartbreaking and not a true depiction of our community. Now there’s a picture of him going viral on twitter and of course Mississippi is taking some big hits because of it.”      She added, “He doesn’t speak for me, my family or my friends. I’m disgusted.”      Rashaud said seeing the shirt in a polling station helped crystalize how important it was for him and other black people to cast a ballot.      “That’s the reason why we need to get out and vote. That’s my main message.” ||||| In an online post a few months later, Hickey described himself as a “generous and open-handed humanitarian who believes in helping others.” The post went on to say Hickey “is always ready to help the needy” and that “his charitable nature and loving attitude set an example for others to follow.” |||||","output":"A registered nurse named Clayton John Hickey was fired from his job at Regional One Health after being photographed wearing a racist T-shirt at a polling station in Mississippi.

It says 80% of parents are concerned about kids meeting bad people online. That's because young people who largely have grown up with the Net think of it as a social outlet , say the researchers. To young people, the benefits of giving out some personal information to reach out to friends outweigh the risks. And the study shows they are so comfortable with the medium that 78% have a personal website or blog. Parents also recognize the importance of the Internet. The survey shows 91% think the Net helps their children explore their passions, and 77% think the Internet is one of the most valuable education tools teens have. But 88% think it's important to know what their kids are doing online. Findings suggest both parents and teens need more education about using online media, Steyer says. Internet safety has become an increasing concern for parents in America. Organizations like the Non-profit Common Sense have been trying to reach and help parents pay attention to the problem.

Ahmad claimed to be the Mahdi, building up a large following. After his death Abdallahi ibn Muhammad took over the movement, adopting the title of Khalifat al-Mahdi (usually rendered as \\"Khalifa\\"). He attempted to create a kingdom, which led to widespread discontent, and his eventual defeat and death at the hands of the British.  - Note : The Battle of Tofrek is also referred to as the Battle of McNeill 's Zeriba ( or M'Neill 's Zeriba ) The Battle of Tofrek was fought on 22 March 1885 some 5 miles inland from the port of Suakin on the Red Sea coast of Sudan .

Math Problem Solve 164*i + 570 = 9331 - 561 for i.","output":"Okay, let's solve this math problem step by step. Imagine we have some candies and we want to find out how many candies are in one bag (that's our \\"i\\"). 1. First, we have the number of candies in all the bags (164*i) and we got an additional 570 candies. 2. Then, there is a total of 9331 candies minus 561 candies. So, we have this equation: 164*i + 570 = 9331 - 561 Let's solve this equation step-by-step: Step 1: Subtract 561 from 9331. 9331 - 561 = 8770 Now our equation looks like this: 164*i + 570 = 8770 Step 2: Subtract 570 from both sides of the equation. 164*i + 570 - 570 = 8770 - 570 164*i = 8200 Step 3: Now we need to find out how many candies are in one bag (value of 'i'). To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 164. 164*i / 164 = 8200 / 164 i = 50 So 'i' is equal to 50. This means there are 50 candies in one bag."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Give the devil his due.","output":"The word \\"due\\" in both sentences carries a similar connotation, but there are some slight contextual differences in its meaning and usage.  In the first sentence, \\"Give him his due -- he is a good actor,\\" the word \\"due\\" refers to giving someone the recognition, appreciation, or acknowledgment that they deserve for a specific quality or skill they possess. In this case, it is acknowledging the person as a good actor. Here, \\"due\\" indicates the just and deserving credit that should be granted based on the person's merit. In the second sentence, \\"Give the devil his due,\\" the meaning of \\"due\\" is similar but falls within the context of a well-known idiom. The idiom means to acknowledge a person's good qualities or achievements despite their overall negative image or character. The \\"devil\\" usually refers to someone who is disliked, mistrusted, or has a tainted reputation, but even such individuals can have positive qualities or accomplish something commendable. The idea behind the idiom is that we should be fair and objective when assessing people and grant them the recognition they deserve even if we may not like them personally. In both sentences, \\"due\\" implies giving someone their deserved recognition or acknowledgment for their qualities or accomplishments. However, in the first sentence, it is a straightforward acknowledgment of the person's skill or talent, while in the second sentence, it delves into the idea of rising above personal biases or judgments to dutifully recognize an individual's positive traits or actions despite their overall persona."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

To punish the prince for his lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the curse will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return, before the last petal falls on his 21st birthday. Ten years later, in a nearby village, a beautiful, young, book-loving woman named Belle dreams of adventure and brushes off advances from Gaston, a handsome, narcissistic and arrogant hunter. On his way to a fair and lost in the forest, Belle's father Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice's place. Belle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods.

She was raised in rural Kentucky and lived briefly in the Congo in her early childhood. Kingsolver earned degrees in biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. Her widely known works include \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\", the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and \\"Animal, Vegetable, Miracle\\", a non-fiction account of her family's attempts to eat locally.  - Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the creative ability to form images, ideas, and sensations in the mind without direct input from the senses, such as seeing or hearing. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to \\"evoke worlds\\".  - A fair (archaic: faire or fayre) is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities. It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice.  - In linguistics, sound symbolism, phonesthesia or phonosemantics is the idea that vocal sounds or phonemes carry meaning in and of themselves.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary.   - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.  - Phonaesthetics (from the \\"phn\\", \\"voice-sound\\"; and \\"aisthtik\\", \\"aesthetics\\") is the study of the inherent pleasantness (euphony) or unpleasantness (cacophony) of the sound of certain words, phrases, and sentences.  - The PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction, formerly known as the Bellwether Prize for Fiction is a biennial award given by the PEN American Center and Barbara Kingsolver to a U.S. citizen for a previously unpublished work of fiction that address issues of social justice. The prize was established by noted author Barbara Kingsolver, and is funded by her. Winning authors receive a 25,000 award and a publishing contract, from which they receive royalties.   - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.  - Marjorie Kowalski Cole ( July 20 , 1953 -- December 4 , 2009 ) was a writer of poetry , short stories and novels . She won the 2004 Bellwether Prize ( for previously unpublished works of fiction which address issues of social justice ) with her first novel Correcting the Landscape .  - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.  - A novella is a work of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel. The English word \\"\\"novella\\" derives from the Italian \\"novella\\", feminine of \\"novello\\", which means \\"new\\". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages.  - Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities.  - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - JUSTICE is a human rights and law reform organisation based in the United Kingdom. It is the British section of the International Commission of Jurists, the international human rights organisation of lawyers devoted to the legal protection of human rights worldwide. Consequently, members of JUSTICE are predominantly barristers and solicitors, judges, legal academics, and law students.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - PEN America Center (PEN), founded in 1922 and based in New York City, works to advance literature, to defend free expression, and to foster international literary fellowship. The Center has a membership of 3,300 writers, editors, and translators. PEN America Center is the largest of the 144 centers that belong to PEN International, the worldwide association of writers that defends those who are harassed, imprisoned and killed for their views. PEN America Center is one of two PEN centers located in the USA, the other is PEN Center USA in Los Angeles, it covers the USA west of the Mississippi.  - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.  - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.  - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.  - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.    What entity does 'marjorie kowalski cole' has the relation 'occupation' with?

A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"A Somerset Rhapsody and Two Songs without Words"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A quake of magnitude 7.9 is measured at the Earthquake centre, where Dr. Samantha Hill takes command, displacing Dr. Jordan Fisher. U.S. President Paul Hollister and FEMA Director Roy Nolan are informed about the situation. A magnitude 8.4 earthquake opens a crack which engulfs a train east of Redding, California. As a result, Governor Carla Williams, who had just seen her daughter and ex-husband off on a camping trip, agrees to help the Governor of Washington. Amanda Williams and her father Clark Williams arrive at a town named Browning, where everything is covered in a thick red haze. They discover a car with a dead family inside, and are nearly trapped in quicksand. Roy Nolan constructs a task force of the best geologists and seismologists, including Dr. Fisher and Dr. Hill. Dr. Hill mentions her Hidden Fault theory, and is eventually given permission to prove it. She and Dr. Fisher visit a lake, where they see some animals that died from carbon monoxide poisoning, and are almost poisoned themselves. Back at the Task Force Center, Dr. Hill predicts that the next quake will be near San Francisco, California. It is deemed too risky to evacuate the entirety of San Francisco, which is eventually destroyed by a 9.2 magnitude earthquake. After that Dr. Hill predicts the next quake will happen at the San Andreas fault, which would wipe out the West Coast in its present shape killing 50 million people on the way. Dr. Hill hypothesizes that they could \\"weld\\" the fault shut by letting it experience immense heat, which could only be created with nuclear bombs. Part 2[edit] The President after some deliberation follows Nolan's advice to execute Dr. HillÂ´s plan and allows the placement of the nuclear warheads.

Sherry's Pampered Pets should be shut down.  We used Sherry's for boarding for about 1 1/2 years. Two very disturbing incidents led us to stop.  First--we asked to use their restroom.  When we first started going to Sherry's we asked to tour the facilities. We were told that due to liability issues, they could not give us a tour, but we could look at the play areas through the outside windows.  We thought this was a little strange since every single other kennel we've ever been to was willing (and wanted) to give us a tour. We figured we had no reason not to trust them so we accepted their excuse. Fast forward 1 1/2 years-- I desperately needed to use a restroom.  They didn't want to let me use it at first, but I told them it was an emergency and they let me. Quickly learned why they did not want to let me back there or give customers tours of the facilities.  The closed off area, that they don't want customers touring, is unbelievably, phenomenally filthy. And that's an understatement. I have never seen a dirtier restroom in even the seediest, filthiest truck stop gas station I have ever been to.  More importantly--they had stacks of kennels that looked like they came from a puppy mill.  They only place i have ever seen such dirty kennels and such a filthy facility is in those gut-wrenching puppy mill videos you see on SPCA or PETA.  It should be criminal to be running such a disgustingly filthy boarding operation.  Second--We went on an extended vacation (about two weeks). When we returned, our dog looked very tired and skinny.  The owner's sister (the older lady with the tattoos) informed us that our dog had not been eating anything for almost the entire stay at the kennel and she had consistent diarrhea for same amount of time.  We asked her if they made any attempt to call us or a veterinarian and she confirmed that nobody from Sherry's Pampered Pets did so at any time. At least 1-2 weeks of diarrhea and lack of appetite and not a single person at Sherry's bothers to call us or take our dog to a vet. We confirmed this story 3 times with this lady (because we were so shocked and could not believe the level of neglect). Short of our dog dying, I can not think of a much more extreme case of kennel negligence.  This situation should be (and possibly is) criminal neglect.    We returned to Sherry's within a few days to speak with Sherry.  When we did, her sister had completely changed her story (or so Sherry says).  Sherry claimed that her sister told her that our dog was sick for only the last 1-2 days of boarding. We asked Sherry to bring her sister out so we could confront her with her lie and Sherry refused.  Sherry's adult daughter then got in our face, yelling at us for \\"accusing\\" her aunt of lying (which she blatantly did). Needless to say, Sherry refused to refund our money or pay or veterinarian bills.  Short of our dog dying, we could not think of a more egregious, disturbing situation of animal neglect by a boarding kennel.  Not only did Sherry's completely violate our trust, they abusively (and possibly criminally) neglected our dog.  I really can not find the words to express how phenomenally disgusted and outraged we were over this case of extraordinary dishonesty, abuse and disturbing conduct by Sherry, her sister and her daughter.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as highly negative, expressing strong dissatisfaction, disappointment, and anger towards Sherry's Pampered Pets.

Have you ever dreamed of owning a Country Inn and restaurant in New England? Well, here is your chance! Located in southwestern Maine overlooking the White Mountains is The Center Lovell Inn and Restaurant. In 1993, the former owner ran an essay contest and I was the winner. After 22 successful years, it is time for me to retire. Now, I would like to fulfill someone else’s dream.      The Inn was built in 1805, the barn on 1795 and the adjacent guest house in 1985. There are 7 guest units, two dining rooms, and a screened-in wrap-around porch overlooking the mountains, all on 12+- acres.      This area attracts guests from around the world for biking, hiking, skiing and all kinds of boating on beautiful Kezar Lake (across the street) and the many other lakes in this “Lake District” of Maine.

Janice Sage      Owner and Innkeeper      Advertisements ||||| BOWDOINHAM, Maine The owner of an idyllic Maine country inn valued at 905,000 has plans to give it all away to the winner of an essay contest she launched early this year.      Applicants must be eager to run the business and convey their qualifications in an impeccably crafted, but spare, 200-word essay, the owner of the Center Lovell Inn and Restaurant, Janice Sage, said on Monday.      Sage, who first launched her contest in January on Facebook, said in an interview that she aims to garner as many as 7,500 paid submissions by May 17th.      At 125 per entry, that would be enough to cover the estimated value of the 210-year old facility, plus an additional 20,000 for the next owner.      \\"There are a lot of talented people that can't, just can't, go out and buy an inn like this,\\" she said. \\"Now all they need to do is write and convince me.\\"      The hotel, together with a barn built in 1895 and other outbuildings, is located about 55 miles northwest of Portland and offers sweeping views of New Hampshire's snow-capped mountains.      Sage, who has run the inn for 22 years, will select the top 20 essays then pass them on to two unnamed local residents to judge the finalists and select a winner.      Other than the contest rules, vetted by Maine authorities and available online, Sage said she is not giving out any hints to help guide applicants.      There is some fine print.      The winner, Sage said, must agree to operate the business for one year following transfer of ownership, and will keep the inn painted its traditional white, with green or black roofing and shutters.      Even the idea for the contest is rooted in tradition, she said.      Sage herself took ownership of the inn in 1993, after she won a similar essay contest launched by the previous owner.      \\"I came here on angel's wings,\\" she said. \\"I hope I can do the same for someone else.\\"      (Editing by Scott Malone and Susan Heavey) ||||| Janice Sage acquired the inn in an essay contest 22 years ago, and she wants to pass it on the same way.      LOVELL, Maine — Wanted: new owner for a classic Maine inn. Experience: whatever you’ve got. Requirements: 200 words of pithy persuasion.      Oh, also needed is a willingness to work 17 hours a day.      But for anyone who has day-dreamed of jumping off the 9-to-5 treadmill and running a country inn, Janice Sage is offering an essay contest to let them do just that.

Sage expects more than 7,500 entries from around the globe. At 125 per entry, the total she rakes in could surge past the inn’s estimated value of 900,000.      Sage makes no apologies for seeking a large nest egg as she sails into the rest of her life. After 22 years at the Lovell Inn, and 16 years before that as manager of a busy Maryland restaurant, Sage said she’s earned the right to sit down more than once in a while.      Advertisement      “My feet have been getting bigger every year,” she said with a chuckle. “I’ve always been on the go.”      Sage gave few clues to what the winning essay should look like, other than being grammatically correct and showing passion for the work. The subject, “Why I would like to own and operate a country inn,” seems simple. But stringing together the right 200 words — about one-fifth the length of this article — with the right tone, right ingredients, and right passion will be challenging.      Even the winning formula used two decades ago remains a mystery. Sage said the essay is the property of the previous owner and she is prohibited from disclosing its contents. But Sage was more than happy to describe what running the inn requires.      “Unless you raise 14 kids, you’re not going to be used to this,” Sage said, referencing the needs of seven rooms a day, seven days a week in high season. “Look, this is something you start when you’re young. It takes a lot of stamina.”      Reading 7,500 essays also will take a lot of stamina, and Sage intends to read them all by May 17. She will pass along the top 20 essays — without names or addresses — to two people from the area whose identities also will remain a mystery.      Advertisement      The judges are charged with choosing a winner by May 21, and the transfer is expected to occur within 30 days after that.      The deal comes with strings. The new owner must agree to maintain the property as a country inn and restaurant for at least one year after the hand-over, keep the building painted white, and maintain the roofing and shutters in forest green, hunter green, or black.      Dina Rudick/Globe Staff Janice Sage said she will miss her “big old grande-dame” and the guests she has gotten to know over the years.      And there are sweeteners. The victor will receive 20,000 to start running the property, which includes a wraparound porch, a cavernous kitchen, and 12 acres close to Kezar Lake.      The furnishings and equipment come with the inn, but any leftover food and liquor go to Sage, a native of central New York who plans to continue to live near here.      “Why would I go anywhere else? It was too hot in Maryland,” Sage said with a laugh. “New England and upstate New York are a very comfortable place for me — somewhere north of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.”      But when she wrote her essay more than two decades ago, Sage had never been to Maine. A friend heard about the contest on the Phil Donahue television show, and Sage paid the 100 entry fee after winning a small prize in the Maryland state lottery.      Three weeks later, she was on her way to Lovell, a village in southwestern Maine within sight of Mount Washington. Sage flew to Portland and hired a driver, who soon became lost while navigating the back roads to the property.      Once in Lovell, however, all was well after Sage spied the inn. “It could have been half in the ground, and I would have taken it,” she recalled. “I was thrilled.”      Not all that followed was thrilling: 500,000 in renovations, scrambling to serve up to 120 diners a night, and two guests whom she told never to return. “One was just being annoying on purpose,” she recalled with a grimace.      Still, the work and its routine have been their own rewards.      “I call her my grande-dame, my big old grande-dame,” Sage said wistfully. “I tell her when I’m painting that if she didn’t clean up so well, I wouldn’t do this.”      And then there are the guests — except the two annoying ones, of course — whom Sage said she’ll miss.      The constant shuffle of visitors meant constantly changing conversations, and close bonds formed between Sage and parents who stayed at the inn every year while delivering children to summer camps.      “I’ll miss it for all the good reasons,” Sage said. “I’ve loved it.”      For her successor, the innkeeper offered advice that should prove to be tougher in practice than concept.      “Just breeze on through and don’t let things bother you,” Sage said. “Enjoy, just enjoy.”      Dina Rudick/Globe Staff “My feet have been getting bigger every year,” Janice Sage said with a chuckle. “I’ve always been on the go.”      Related:      • In Caribou, Maine’s biting cold, you must have ‘zero’ tolerance      • Culinary boom in Portland, Maine      • For Maine’s governor, a harsh past forges steely presence      • More real estate coverage      Brian MacQuarrie can be reached at macquarrie@globe .com |||||","output":"The owner of the Center Lovell Inn and Restaurant, Janice Sage, is planning on giving away her country inn in Maine, valued at 905,000, to the winner of an essay contest she launched earlier this year.

Please answer the following question: This article: By the mid-1960s Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \\"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.\\"In line with the Hindu yoga tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda – yogis and authors, respectively, of Raja Yoga and Autobiography of a Yogi. In mid-1969, he produced the single \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\", performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom he described as \\"my friend ... my master\\" and \\"a perfect example of everything he preached\\". Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly japa-yoga chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee.Regarding other faiths he once remarked: \\"All religions are... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who said \\"For me, it was like a flash.

Write an article based on this \\"The investigation into the Croydon tram crash is likely to call for increased measures to prevent trams from speeding at high-risk locations, it is claimed.\\"","output":"Title: Better Ways to Keep Trams Safe in High-Risk Places Once upon a time, there was a big, busy town called Croydon. In Croydon, people used trams to go from one place to another. Trams are like big buses with metal wheels that travel on tracks. But one day, a tram went too fast, and it caused a crash. This made the people in Croydon very sad and worried, so they wanted to know why it happened. Now, some smart people are trying to find out what went wrong in the tram crash. They are called investigators. Investigators are like detectives who try to solve puzzles or mysteries. They want to make sure that trams in Croydon and other towns stay safe for everyone to use. The investigators think that one way to make trams safer is to stop them from going too fast, especially in places where fast trams can be dangerous. These are called high-risk locations. High-risk locations are like crossing a busy street or walking on thin ice. They make accidents more likely to happen. The smart people believe there should be new rules to help trams slow down in high-risk locations. This might be like having a grown-up hold your hand when you cross a busy street. It helps to make sure you are safe. These new rules could include special devices that automatically slow down trams when they reach dangerous places. It's like when your mom puts the brakes on your bike when you're going downhill too fast. Another idea is to make signs and lights that tell the tram driver to be extra careful and slow down at these locations. Just like the traffic lights we see on the roads. By following these new ideas, the investigators hope that the people of Croydon and other towns will be able to ride trams safely and happily. They want to make sure that no one gets hurt again in a tram crash. Everyone in Croydon and other places can help to keep trams safe, too. Just like you can be safe by holding a grown-up's hand when crossing a busy street, you can also help tram drivers by following rules and being careful riders. And so, the people in Croydon and in other towns can all work together to make trams a fun and safe way to travel. When the trams are safe, everyone can enjoy riding them to visit their friends, go shopping, or have new adventures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is a metaphorical way of saying that, like a less vibrant or dull-colored crayon in a box of brightly colored crayons, the person being referred to stands out as not being particularly distinct or remarkable in terms of their mental capabilities. This phrase is a variant of other colloquial expressions, such as \\"not the sharpest tool in the shed\\" or \\"not the brightest bulb in the chandelier,\\" all of which serve the same purpose of highlighting someone's perceived lack of intellect or understanding. In the context of your statement, you're implying that the girl in question had a tendency to gossip and frequently needed assistance, possibly suggesting that she struggled to comprehend certain concepts or displayed an overall lack of insight. By using the expression \\"she wasn't the brightest crayon in the box,\\" you're conveying the idea that her cognitive abilities or problem-solving skills were not particularly impressive or advanced. However, it is important to note that such idioms might be perceived as derogatory or offensive, as they blatantly criticize someone's intelligence. It is generally a good idea to avoid using phrases that might be deemed rude or inconsiderate when communicating with others, especially if the person being referred to is present or there is a chance of them becoming aware of the remark.

Process:  - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the plant creates glucose happens, how will it affect LESS digestion occuring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that if a plant creates glucose, it would lead to less digestion occurring. To evaluate the potential effects of this scenario, let's break down the digestion process and see if the presence of glucose could indeed impact it. 1. The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow. Saliva contains enzymes like amylase that starts the breakdown of carbohydrates in the mouth. If there's already glucose in the food from the plant, it's an end product of carbohydrate digestion; therefore, it wouldn't need further breakdown by amylase. However, the formation of glucose does not affect the saliva's role in making the food easier to swallow. 2. Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth. The presence of glucose wouldn't have any impact on the tongue's function, since its role is to manipulate food during chewing and swallowing. 3. The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach. Glucose also has no effect on the esophagus function of moving food to the stomach through peristalsis. 4. Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach. In the stomach, proteins are primarily broken down by the action of gastric juices, including hydrochloric acid and pepsin. Glucose would not have an impact on protein digestion in the stomach. 5. Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion. As food enters the small intestine, it mixes with more digestive enzymes and bile to break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. While glucose is absorbed directly in the small intestine without needing further breakdown, its presence wouldn't \\"slow down\\" the rest of the digestion process. In conclusion, while the presence of glucose produced by plants would affect how carbohydrates are processed in the body, its effect wouldn't be enough to significantly decrease digestion overall. The digestion process encompasses various macronutrients and their respective breakdown processes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Government media has provided a different account suggesting regime forces are winning. The battle is taking place in Maaloula, a scenic mountain village where people still speak the ancient Middle Eastern language of Aramaic.","output":"Title: The Complex Fight for Maaloula, Syria: A Cultural Site Torn by Turmoil Introduction The ongoing Syrian conflict, which has already seen countless lives lost and cities razed to the ground, is now claiming not only lives but the unique cultural heritage of the nation as well. Among the numerous sites affected by the conflict, the small Christian village of Maaloula stands out as a tragic example of the price a nation pays when it finds itself at the mercy of warring factions. This article aims to shed light on the complex and harrowing situation in Maaloula, a timeless cultural site now caught in a web of escalating turmoil. Syrian Rebels and Al-Qaeda-linked Fighters Seize Maaloula In a concerning turn of events, it has been reported that Syrian rebels, including fighters linked to the international terrorist organization Al-Qaeda, have managed to gain control over the Christian village of Maaloula. This development has raised fears of an even more brutal conflict in Syria, one that might see the region's important cultural history forever wiped out. Maaloula is no ordinary village; nestled in a scenic mountainous region northeast of the capital city, Damascus, it is renowned for being one of the few places in the world where the ancient Middle Eastern language of Aramaic, the language spoken by Jesus Christ, is still in use. As such, it serves as a valuable living testament to a crucial epoch in the history of the region, and indeed that of the world. Conflicting Accounts Emerge While reports suggest that the Syrian rebels and Al-Qaeda-linked fighters have succeeded in capturing the historical village, official government media sources have offered a counter-narrative, claiming that the embattled regime forces are winning the battle for control over Maaloula. This divergence of accounts has resulted in a highly fluid and uncertain situation, with the fate of the village's inhabitants and its precious cultural heritage hanging in the balance. Danger to Maaloula's Cultural Legacy As the battle for Maaloula rages on, observers and analysts have voiced concerns about the immense danger posed to its unique cultural legacy. For centuries, the village's residents have maintained their distinct identity, cherishing and preserving their Aramaic language and Christian faith. Now, their livelihood, faith and history are under siege by the relentless forces of war. The destruction of Maaloula would not just signify a loss to Syria, but to the world, erasing a vital cultural asset that could provide insights and understanding into the ancient civilizations and their legacies that are no longer in existence. Conclusion The fight for Maaloula demonstrates the depth and complexity of the Syrian conflict; this is not just a battle for land or power, but also one for the very soul and identity of the nation. As the opposing factions vie for control over the village, they are inadvertently placing the region's unique cultural treasure at risk. The hope now lies in a resolution—whether diplomatic or other—that can not only bring an end to the bloodshed but also protect and preserve the irreplaceable gems of human heritage, such as Maaloula, for future generations to cherish and learn from."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate this to English?","output":"The concept of stability in both elements and humans has the same cause, which is a state of equitable balance. The original German phrase \\"Auch Stabilität hat bei den Elementen und im Menschen dieselbe Ursache, nämlich gleichwertige Ausgewogenheit\\" can be translated to English as stated above. This statement emphasizes that the underlying foundation for stability in both the elemental world and in humans lies in a balance of forces or properties. In other words, an equal distribution or proportionality of factors contributes to a steady state, whether it be in a chemical or physical system, or within aspects of the human body and mind. In the context of elements, a stable configuration often refers to the balance of forces between atoms and/or molecules in a system. This can be found when the energy of the system is minimized, meaning the interactions among the components are relatively stable and no significant changes will happen without an external force acting on it. For example, the molecules of water have a harmonious balance of atomic forces that keep them stable under normal conditions. Turning to the context of humans, stability can be seen in various aspects, whether it is physical, mental, or emotional. In each of these cases, a balance among various factors leads to a stable state. Physically, humans maintain equilibrium through various bodily systems such as regulating body temperature, blood glucose levels, and hormonal balance. Mentally, a stable person is one who establishes harmony between various cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, and decision-making. Emotionally, stability is reflected in a person's ability to effectively manage emotions and maintain emotional equilibrium. Therefore, the idea of \\"equitable balance\\" or \\"gleichwertige Ausgewogenheit\\" represents a fundamental principle in understanding stability across different contexts. By achieving balance, whether in the elements or in human beings, stability can be attained, promoting overall harmony and wellbeing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"This is particularly dangerous to the applicant, where the web site retrieved belongs to a competitor.\\" said in French?","output":"\\"Ceci est particulièrement dangereux pour le demandeur, lorsque le site Web récupéré appartient à un concurrent.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of the translation: 1. \\"This is\\" can be translated to \\"Ceci est\\" in French. \\"Ceci\\" refers to an object or idea that is close to the speaker and \\"est\\" is the third person singular form of the verb \\"être\\" (to be). 2. \\"particularly\\" translates to \\"particulièrement\\" in French. The word retains a similar structure and spelling in both languages. 3. \\"dangerous\\" is translated as \\"dangereux\\" in French. \\"Dangereux\\" is the masculine singular form of the adjective, which agrees with the gender of the noun it describes (in this case, \\"dangerous\\" describes \\"this\\", which is replaced by \\"ceci\\" in French). 4. \\"to the applicant\\" can be translated to \\"pour le demandeur\\" in French. \\"Pour\\" means \\"for\\" or \\"to\\" and \\"le demandeur\\" means \\"the applicant.\\" In French, most nouns have a gender, and \\"demandeur\\" is a masculine noun, hence it is preceded by the masculine definite article \\"le.\\" 5. \\"where\\" can be translated to \\"lorsque\\" in this context, as it is used as a conjunction to introduce a conditional or temporal clause. 6. \\"the website\\" translates to \\"le site Web\\" in French. Once again, the noun \\"site\\" is masculine, so it's accompanied by the masculine definite article \\"le.\\" In French, the term \\"Web\\" remains the same as in English. 7. \\"retrieved\\" translates to \\"récupéré\\" in French. The term \\"récupéré\\" is the past participle of the verb \\"récupérer,\\" which means \\"to retrieve\\" or \\"to recover.\\" In this context, we use the past participle to describe the website, so it directly follows \\"le site Web.\\" 8. \\"belongs to\\" translates to \\"appartient à\\" in French. The verb \\"appartenir\\" (to belong) is conjugated in the third person singular form as \\"appartient\\" and is followed by the preposition \\"à\\" (to), which is used to introduce the person or entity to whom something belongs. 9. \\"a competitor\\" can be translated into \\"un concurrent\\" in French. The indefinite article \\"un\\" agrees with the masculine noun \\"concurrent\\" as they both refer to a competitor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The reviewer also mentions their primary objective was finding \\"a cool place to hang out\\" and enjoy drinks close to their home.

Although the sentiment so far has been negative, the reviewer does highlight a positive – the extended happy hour timing from 2-7 pm every day.

Frank accidentally unleashes the toxic gas, which renders the two unconscious.

Given the question: Article: When most of us hear the word chocolate, the verb that comes to mind is probably \\"eat\\", not \\"drink\\", and the most proper adjective would seem to be \\"sweet\\". But for about 90 percent of chocolate's long history, it was strictly a beverage  , and sugar didn't have anything to do with it. The Origin of Chocolate Many modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older. In the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe prove that the earliest linguistic   evidence of chocolate consumption dates back three or even four thousand years. Valuable and Fashionable Chocolate Beverage It's hard to discover exactly when chocolate was born, but it's clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document. Sweetened chocolate didn't appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled   the native cuisine. Chocolate didn't suit the foreigners' taste at first -- one described it in his writings as \\"a bitter drink for pigs\\" -- but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal functions. But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. The Birth of Solid Chocolate In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate. His product became known as \\"Dutch cocoa\\", and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. In 1847, Joseph Fry created the first modern chocolate bar. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later. Prosperous Chocolate Industry In America, chocolate was so valued during... Question: Why did chocolate suit the Spanish's taste so quickly?   _ Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because chocolate was sweetened with honey or cane sugar.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"Because chocolate was sweetened with honey or cane sugar.\\" Chocolate originally did not suit the taste preferences of the Europeans. When they first encountered it, they described it as \\"a bitter drink for pigs.\\" However, once chocolate was mixed with sweeteners like honey or cane sugar, it quickly gained popularity among the Spanish. The addition of these sweeteners transformed the taste, making it more palatable and appealing to their taste buds. This sweetened chocolate eventually led to it becoming a fashionable drink in Spain and later throughout Europe in the 17th century."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

When he confronts, star boxer, Tae Wook's coach and advisor they threaten him and tell him that it was his daughter that brought it upon herself. So out of frustration and anger Ga Pil enters into the school lot of whick Tae Wook attends, carrying a knife hidden in a roll of newspaper. As school ended and students departed the school building Ga Pil nervously drops the knife for all to see. He points it around the gathered students out of fear, when a mysterious face shows up through the crowded students. In steady movement Go Seung Suk walks right up to Ga Pil and severes him a blow to head that knocked him out. In an abandoned room near the school Ga Pil meets Go Seung Suk and his friends, Oh Se Jung and Chae Subin, where they brainstorm a plan for Ga Pil to gain his revenge and beat Tae Wook.For the seemingly impossible task he asks Go Seung Suk , a rebellious high school student with talent for fighting, to train him in only 45 days. So all three boys get together to train Ga Pil while at the same time kept records of his success through the training to show his daughter what kind of father Ga Pil is. When the training came to an end, the trio setup up a private show in the gymnasium where Seung Suk loured Tae Wook, thinking it was a match between himself and Go Seung Suk. As the gymnasium filled with students Ga Pil came out in boxing attire above a business suit prepared for the matched. The first round had Go Seung Suk fighting Tae Wook's friends, where they lost and the second round was with Tae Wook versus Ga Pil.

Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which is primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.  - The New York University School of Medicine is one of the graduate schools of New York University.

It is the cause of 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years. The cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. About 70% of the risk is believed to be genetic with many genes usually involved. Other risk factors include a history of head injuries, depression, or hypertension. The disease process is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis. Mental and physical exercise, and avoiding obesity may decrease the risk of AD. There are no medications or supplements that decrease risk. No treatments stop or reverse its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing a burden on the caregiver; the pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programmes may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes. Treatment of behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common but not usually recommended due to there often being little benefit and an increased...  - The National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formerly the Institute of Medicine) is an American nonprofit, non-governmental organization.

They are administered by the Lasker Foundation, founded by Albert Lasker and his wife Mary Woodard Lasker (later a medical research activist). The awards are sometimes referred to as \\"America's Nobels\\". Lasker Award has gained a reputation for identifying future winners of the Nobel Prize. Eighty-six Lasker laureates have received the Nobel Prize, including 32 in the last two decades. Claire Pomeroy is the current President of the Foundation.  - Inelastic neutron scattering is an experimental technique commonly used in condensed matter research to study atomic and molecular motion as well as magnetic and crystal field excitations. It distinguishes itself from other neutron scattering techniques by resolving the change in kinetic energy that occurs when the collision between neutrons and the sample is an inelastic one. Results are generally communicated as the dynamic structure factor (also called inelastic scattering law) formula_1, sometimes also as the dynamic susceptibility formula_2 where the scattering vector formula_3 is the difference between incoming and outgoing wave vector, and \\"formula_4\\" is the energy change experienced by the sample (negative that of the scattered neutron). When results are plotted as function of formula_5, they can often be interpreted in the same way as spectra obtained by conventional spectroscopic techniques; insofar as inelastic neutron scattering can be seen as a special spectroscopy.  - Aporphine is one of a class of quinoline alkaloids. Many different relatives of this compound have been purified from plants. One commonly used aporphine derivative is apomorphine, which can be found in Nymphaea caerulea. Aporphines from other plants include some that occur in extracts of Cassytha species that have been used in African folk medicine to treat cancer and trypanosomiasis. In vitro tests of some of the aporphines from \\"Cassytha filiformis\\", namely actinodaphnine, cassythine, and dicentrine, on Trypanosoma brucei did show promising levels of activity.

A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine, nursing, business, engineering, or law. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute, as various professional schools offer graduate degrees (e.g., some nursing schools offer a master's degree in nursing). Also, some graduate degrees train students for a specific profession (e.g. an MSc or a PhD in epidemiology trains a person to be an epidemiologist).  - David J. E.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - Short-term memory (or \\"primary\\" or \\"active memory\\") is the capacity for holding, but not manipulating, a small amount of information in mind in an active, readily available state for a short period of time. The duration of short-term memory (when rehearsal or active maintenance is prevented) is believed to be in the order of seconds. The most commonly cited capacity is \\"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two\\" (which is frequently referred to as \\"Miller's Law\\"), despite the fact that Miller himself stated that the figure was intended as \\"little more than a joke\\" (Miller, 1989, page 401) and that Cowan (2001) provided evidence that a more realistic figure is 4±1 units. In contrast, long-term memory can hold an indefinite amount of information. Short-term memory should be distinguished from working memory, which refers to structures and processes used for temporarily storing and manipulating information (see details below).  - The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is a United States nonprofit, non-governmental organization. NAS is part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, along with the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM).  - Apomorphine (brand names Apokyn, Ixense, Spontane, Uprima) is a type of aporphine having activity as a non-selective dopamine agonist which activates both D-like and, to an order of magnitude lesser extent, D-like receptors. It also acts as an antagonist of 5-HT and -adrenergic receptors with high affinity. The compound is historically a morphine decomposition product by boiling with concentrated acid, hence the -\\"morphine\\" suffix. Apomorphine does not actually contain morphine or its skeleton, nor does it bind to opioid receptors. The \\"apo\\"- prefix relates to it being a morphine derivative (\\"[comes] from morphine\\").  - Richard Phillips Feynman (May 11, 1918  February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin'ichir Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.  - Argonne National Laboratory is a science and engineering research national laboratory operated by UChicago Argonne LLC for the United States Department of Energy located near Lemont, Illinois, outside Chicago.

Two teens died in Fort Lauderdale, Florida crash on Tuesday. The probe is not expected to involve Tesla's semi-autonomous Autopilot system. (May 11) AP      A Tesla sedan with a semi-autonomous Autopilot feature rear-ended a fire department truck at 60 mph (97 kph) apparently without braking before impact on May 11, 2018, but police say it's unknown if the Autopilot feature was engaged. (Photo: South Jordan Police Department/AP)      SAN FRANCISCO — A Tesla Model S that crashed into a stopped fire truck at high speed was operating in Autopilot mode, the driver of the car told Utah police officials.      Tesla says it continues to work with police on the investigation, and has not yet released details of the incident based on the car's computer logs.      The driver of the vehicle, a 28-year-old woman from Lehi, Utah, slammed into the truck in South Jordan, Utah on Friday. The woman also told police she was looking at her phone prior to the collision and estimated her speed at 60 mph, which is consistent with eyewitness accounts, according to a police statement issued late Monday.      The result of the violent crash was an accordioned front end for the electric car, but only a broken foot for the driver, according to Sgt. Sam Winkler of the South Jordan Police Department.      The driver of the United Fire Authority mechanic truck was evaluated for whiplash and was not checked into the hospital.      Tesla said the company's previous response to the crash still stood, which noted that Autopilot — a semi-autonomous system that works like a souped-up cruise control — requires constant vigilance and is not meant to take over driving responsibilities while the driver focuses on other chores.      Winkler said that South Jordan police was continuing to investigate the crash, and would be working with Tesla to gather vehicle information from the Model S's computers over the coming days. Police officials also said they were getting technical assistance from National Transportation Safety Board officials.      Eyewitness accounts indicate the Model S did not slow down or swerve as it rammed into the back of the truck, which was stopped at a traffic light in the far right lane.      More: Elon Musk shakes up Tesla as another Model S faces crash queries      More: Tesla crash that killed two Florida teens probed by NTSB investigators      Autopilot has been in the crosshairs of federal crash investigators, dating back to a 2016 crash of Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode that killed its driver after the car failed to stop for a tractor trailer that cut across its path.      More recently, the NTSB was called in to review details of a March crash in which a Tesla Model X slam into a highway divider in Mountain View, Calif. The driver died.      Tesla has said the California driver ignored the car's warnings to take back control of the vehicle. But the driver's family is considering suing on the grounds that Tesla ignored the driver's previously raised concerns about Autopilot acting up on that same stretch of Silicon Valley highway.      NTSB and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials also are investigating a recent Tesla Model S crash in Florida in which two teens died and one was injured.      The car hit a concrete barrier at high speed in a residential neighborhood and burst into flames. Autopilot is not thought to be a factor, but investigators are looking into the ensuing battery fire.      Just prior to Utah police announcing that the driver indicated Autopilot had been in use, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted a series of tweets that emphasized the safety of his product.      What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2018      \\"What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle,\\" Musk tweeted (although initially reported as an ankle injury, South Jordan officials said the injury was a broken foot). \\"An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.\\"      Musk also lamented media coverage that he said glossed over the 40,000 annual U.S. road deaths, and acknowledged that while no technology is perfect \\"a system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released.\\"      Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.      Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rDPulU ||||| Long before the fatal crash of a Tesla car in March, some developers of the vehicle’s Autopilot system expressed concern there weren’t enough safeguards to ensure drivers remained attentive, people familiar with the discussions said.      Tesla Inc.’s engineers repeatedly discussed adding sensors that would ensure drivers look at the road or keep their hands on the wheel both before and after the driver-assistance system was introduced in 2015, these people said.      ... ||||| Engineers inside Tesla wanted to add robust driver monitoring systems to the company’s cars to help make sure drivers safely use Autopilot, and Tesla even worked with suppliers on possible solutions, according to The Wall Street Journal. But those executives — Elon Musk included — reportedly rejected the idea out of worry that the options might not work well enough, could be expensive, and because drivers might become annoyed by an overly nagging system.      Tesla considered a few different types of monitoring: one that would track a driver’s eyes using a camera and infrared sensors, and another that involved adding more sensors to the steering wheel to make sure that the driver is holding on. Both ideas would help let the car’s system know if the driver has stopped paying attention, which could reduce the chance of an accident in situations where Autopilot disengages or is incapable of keeping the car from crashing.      Musk later confirmed on Twitter that the eye tracking option was “rejected for being ineffective, not for cost.”      Musk later confirmed the news on Twitter This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2018      While a name like “Autopilot” might suggest there aren’t situations a Tesla car can’t handle, accidents still happen even when Autopilot is engaged, and three people have died while using the feature. Tesla promises that Autopilot will one day be capable of fully driving the car itself, but the system currently more closely resembles the limited driver assistance packages offered by GM, Nissan, and others.      Tesla cars do lightly monitor drivers by using a sensor to measure small movements in the steering wheel. If the driver doesn’t have their hands on the wheel, they are repeatedly warned, and eventually the car pulls itself to the side of the road and has to be reset before Autopilot can be turned on again. That capability had to be added months after Autopilot was released in 2015, though, after a rash of drivers posted videos of themselves using the driver assistance feature in reckless ways. Even now, there is evidence that it’s possible to fool the steering wheel sensor.      In contrast, GM’s semi-autonomous system, Super Cruise, watches a driver’s face to make sure they’re paying attention to the road. It also allows hands-free driving.      Broadly, though, the National Transportation Safety Board said last September that the whole industry needs to do better at installing safeguards that help make sure these driver assistance features aren’t misused.      The NTSB’s statements came with the conclusion of the safety board’s investigation into the June 2016 death of Joshua Brown, who was the first person to die while using Autopilot in the United States. (A driver who was killed while using Autopilot in China in January 2016 is now believed to be the first person in the world to have been killed while using a driver assistance feature.) At the time, the safety board specifically recommended that Tesla find ways beyond steering wheel sensors to monitor drivers. The NTSB is currently investigating the most recent Autopilot death, which happened in March in California.      Tesla often points out that the number of accidents involving the use of Autopilot is small compared to the scale and frequency of more typical auto accidents. And Musk recently pledged to regularly release data about the performance of Autopilot, which it will start doing at the end of this financial quarter. But Musk also recently said that Autopilot accidents tend to happen because drivers’ attention can drift — something that might be solved with better driver monitoring.      “When there is a serious accident it is almost always, in fact maybe always, the case that it is an experienced user, and the issue is more one of complacency,” Musk said on a quarterly earnings call earlier this month. “They just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It’s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It’s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do.” ||||| It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tesla-with-autopilot-slams-into-truck-stopped-at-red-light/2018/05/12/18d2e740-563e-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7466cb626644 … ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A Tesla car crashed into a stopped fire truck while using the Autopilot feature.

Nasa has revealed new pictures of Curiosity 'looking back' at one of its cameras on the martian surface. It comes as they confirmed the rover has now tested its robotic arm successfully, using a 1909 penny and a piece of rock from New Mexico to calibrate its instruments. The team admitted even they were surprised by the quality of images being sent back after dust covers were removed from the rover's main cameras. Nasa today released this incredible image of Curiosity on the red planet, showing off its wheels and four 'navcams' which act as the rover's eyes on the red planet. 'Wow, seeing these images after all the tremendous hard work that has. gone into making them possible is a profoundly emotional moment,' said. MAHLI Principal Investigator Ken Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems,. San Diego. 'It is so exciting to see the camera returning beautiful,. sharp images from Mars.' NASA's Mars rover Curiosity stepped. through activities on Sept. 7, 8 and 9 designed to check and. characterize precision movements by the rover's robotic arm and use of. tools on the arm. The activities confirmed good health and usefulness of Mars Hand Lens. Imager, or MAHLI, and used that camera to check arm placement during. several positioning activities. MAHLI took an image with its reclosable dust cover open for the first. time on Mars, confirming sharp imaging capability that had been obscured. by a thin film of dust on the cover during previous use of the camera. It took images of cameras at the top of Curiosity's mast, of the. underbelly of the rover and of MAHLI's own calibration target, among. other pointings. The camera's calibration target includes a 1909 Lincoln penny that. Edgett purchased for this purpose. The team calibrated the camera using a 'lucky penny' on the rover's mast. 'We're seeing the penny in the. foreground and, looking past it, a setting I'm sure the people who. minted these coins never imagined,' Edgett said. The penny is a nod to geologists' tradition of placing a coin or other. object of known scale as a size reference in close-up photographs of. rocks, and it gives the public a familiar object for perceiving size. easily when it will be viewed by MAHLI on Mars. 'The folks who drive the rover's arm and turret have taken a 220-pound. arm through some very complex tai chi, to center a penny in an image. that's only a few centimeters across,' said MAHLI Deputy Principal. Investigator Aileen Yingst of the Tucson-based Planetary Science. Institute. 'They make the impossible look easy.' The arm characterization activities, including more imaging by MAHLI,. will continue for a few days before Curiosity resumes driving toward a. mid-term science destination area called Glenelg. In that area, the. rover may use its scoop to collect a soil sample, and later its drill to. collect a sample of powder from inside a rock. Curiosity is five weeks into a two-year prime mission on Mars. It will. use 10 science instruments to assess whether the selected study area. ever has offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. A sample of basaltic rock from a lava flow in New Mexico serves as a calibration target for the rover's Canadian-made Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer. Nasa today revealed stunning new images of Curiosity's wheel on the martian surface taken using the high resolution Mahli camera, which had its dustcover removed for the first time. Wheels down: Nasa used the newly uncovered Mahli camera to take a series of images of the rover's wheel on the red planet's surface. The new images also give tantalising views of the nearby mountains that Curiosity will eventually climb in its quest for for ingredients of life on the red planet. The images also reveal Curiosity's large wheels and distinctive tyre tracks, which leave morse code messages on the surface as it travels.

I first saw this when I was eleven years old. It made an impression on me because it showed women as being powerful and strong willed. It had always been my understanding that women of this time period were always subserviant to men. This obviously shows a different interpretation. My heart aches for Anne when she realizes Henry is done with her simply because she can't bear him a son. Wonderful performances by Burton and Bujold !! Answer: A:","output":"The tone of this product review is mostly positive. The reviewer expresses fascination and entertainment while watching the film and appreciates the different interpretation of women's roles during that time period, as it challenges their original understanding. The mention of the emotional impact (\\"My heart aches for Anne\\") also suggests an engaging and moving experience. Furthermore, the reviewer specifically praises the performances of the actors (Burton and Bujold), reinforcing the positive tone of the review. Although their heart aching for Anne implies an element of sadness or negativity related to the character's experience within the film, the overall impression and appreciation of the movie's message and acting are undeniably positive.

It has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ('). The term \\"Torah\\" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice. Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the foundational narrative of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws (').

The Miami-Herald reported that 36-year-old Chris Emerson left his Greenwood, South Carolina home about five months after getting divorced and crashing his truck. He wanted to relocate to Key West and decided to ride his horse Trigger down. You can meet the most interesting people on The Underline.

Wrecked my truck.” Miami-Dade police stopped Emerson on Wednesday and determined that Trigger was dangerously malnourished. He has been charged with an animal cruelty charge. Officials said Emerson, who was barefoot when he was stopped, had two plastic bags stuffed with lawn trimmings for the horse to eat. “He likes the fresh stuff,” Emerson told the Herald. “He likes the green grass … He’s a good horse.” However, it’s not enough for the horse of his size, Laurie Waggoner told the newspaper. Waggoner runs the rescue stable where Trigger was taken and said Emerson was “misguided” in caring for the horse.

She said a veterinarian determined Trigger was about 20 years old and blind in one eye. “The vet said the horse was not in any condition to be ridden, much less from South Carolina all the way down to Miami,” she said. Authorities said Emerson “appeared homeless” when they stopped him and had depended on the help of others to feed himself and Trigger. Emerson has been charge with animal cruelty and violating an animal’s health requirement, the Herald reported. Emerson said he has not had not been in touch with his family and lost track of time while on his trek. He added that he didn’t really have plans once he arrived to Key West. “I’m thankful to be where I am now,” he told the Herald. “I rode a horse from South Carolina to Miami, Florida.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: how is Santolina and Araujia related? A:","output":"Santolina and Araujia are two distinct genera of flowering plants that belong to different plant families within the Angiosperms (flowering plants) group. Although they exhibit some common characteristics as flowering plants, their relationship lies primarily in their classification as part of the Angiosperms, with each genera belonging to separate families and presenting unique botanical features. To fully understand their relationship, let's dive deeper into their taxonomy, morphology, habitat, and other key aspects. 1. Taxonomy: Santolina is a genus of plants within the Asteraceae family, commonly known as the sunflower, daisy, or composite family. This family is one of the largest families of flowering plants, with over 23,000 species across 1,620 genera. Plant species belonging to the Asteraceae family are characterized by the presence of composite inflorescences called \\"capitula\\" or head, which looks like a single flower but is in fact a compact cluster of multiple flowers. Araujia, on the other hand, belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which consists of about 5,000 species across 425 genera. This family is known as the dogbane, milkweed, or oleander family, characterized by milky latex, opposite leaves, and tubular flowers with five petals. Species of Araujia are mostly herbaceous perennials, climbers or shrubs, with twining stems. 2. Morphology: While both genera share some common features as flowering plants, such as the presence of flowers and the production of seeds, they exhibit differences in their morphology. Santolina species are sub-shrubs or perennial herbs, with compound, pinnatifid, or pinnately divided leaves. Leaves are usually small or narrow and aromatic. The flowers are borne in terminal or axillary capitula, with an involucre composed of imbricated rows of bracts enclosing the Central disk and ray flowers, which are typically small and yellow or white. Araujia species are characterized by their twining or scrambling habit, with tendrils on leaf apexes. The leaves are opposite, and the flowers are tubular, fragrant, and often borne in clusters. Their flowers have five sepals, five petals with a tubular corolla, and a central gynostegium structure that holds the anthers and style in a complex arrangement. The fruit is a large capsule with wind-dispersed flat seeds that bear a tuft of fine silky hairs. 3. Habitat: Santolina plants are native to the Mediterranean region, thriving in open, sunny habitats with well-draining soil. They are well-suited to dry, rocky, or sandy environments and display considerable drought tolerance. They are commonly used as ornamental plants in gardens for their attractive, fine-textured foliage and flowers. Araujia species are native to South America, primarily Argentina, Brazil, and nearby regions. They are adapted to a diverse range of environments, including forests, open grasslands, and coastal areas. Some Araujia species have become invasive in other parts of the world due to their fast-growing habits and prolific seed distribution. Araujia sericifera, commonly known as the cruel vine or moth plant, is one of the most notable invasive species outside its native range. To sum up, Santolina and Araujia are related through their inclusion in the Angiosperms group and share common plant features. However, their relationship is limited by their distinct classification in different families, Asteraceae and Apocynaceae, respectively. Each genus has its unique morphological and physiological characteristics that differentiate them and allow them to thrive in different environments. As such, despite being both flowering plants, the connection between Santolina and Araujia lies mainly in their broader taxonomic context within the Angiosperms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The proposed conclusion is \\"A young man is encouraged before a town hosted charity fight.\\" Here, we gather the following information: 1. There is a young man. 2. He is encouraged. 3. The fight happens before the town hosted charity event. Now, let's analyze if we can conclude the proposed conclusion based on the information given in the initial statement. Option 1: Yes - This option suggests that we can directly infer the proposed conclusion from the initial statement. While both the statement and the conclusion mention a young man and a fight hosted in his town, the initial statement does not provide any information about a charity event or the young man being encouraged. Therefore, we cannot choose this option. Option 2: It is not possible to tell - This option suggests that there is not enough information to determine if the proposed conclusion is true or false. This is the most suitable option because the initial statement does not provide enough information about a charity event or if the young man is being encouraged. The statement only tells us that he is greeting his supporters, which can be a form of encouragement, but it's not a definite indicator. Moreover, there is no mention of a charity fight in the statement, so we cannot determine if the proposed conclusion is accurate or not based on the given information. Option 3: No - This option suggests that the proposed conclusion is entirely wrong based on the initial statement. While we cannot confirm the proposed conclusion, there is also no information in the statement that directly contradicts it. Therefore, choosing this option as the answer would not be accurate either. In conclusion, based on the given statement, we cannot directly infer the proposed conclusion, \\"A young man is encouraged before a town hosted charity fight.\\" As such, the most appropriate answer would be \\"it is not possible to tell\\" since there is not enough information available to determine if this conclusion is accurate or not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union turns the Baltic region into part of the bloodiest front line of World War II. Lecter, his younger sister Mischa, and their parents travel to the family's hunting lodge in the woods to elude the advancing German troops. After three years, the Nazis are finally driven out of the countries soon to be occupied by the Soviet Union. During their retreat, however, they destroy a Soviet tank that had stopped at the Lecter family's lodge looking for water. The explosion kills everyone but Lecter and Mischa. They survive in the cottage until five former Lithuanian militiamen, led by a Nazi collaborator named Vladis Grutas, storm and loot it. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, the men look menacingly at Lecter and Mischa. By 1949, Lecter Castle has been turned into a Soviet orphanage and is ironically housing the interned orphan Hannibal Lecter. After dealing violently with a bully, Lecter escapes from the castle orphanage to Paris to live with his widowed aunt, the Lady Murasaki. While in France, Lecter flourishes as a student. He commits his first murder as a teenager, killing a local butcher who insults his aunt. He is suspected of the murder by Inspector Popil, a French detective who also lost his family in the war. Thanks in part to his aunt's intervention, Lecter escapes responsibility for the crime. Eventually, Lecter becomes the youngest person ever admitted to medical school in France. He works in Paris, where he is given a job preparing cadavers. One day, Lecter witnesses a condemned war criminal receiving a sodium thiopental injection, allowing him to recall details about his war crimes. Consequently, in an attempt to recall the names of those responsible for his sister's death, Lecter injects himself with the solution. His subsequent flashback reveals to the viewers the men who had killed Mischa, had also cannibalized her as well. Lecter returns to Lithuania in search...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: James was born in Holton, Kansas; his mother, died in 1954 when he was five. His father was a janitor and a handyman. After four years at the University of Kansas residing at Stephenson Scholarship hall, James joined the Army in 1971. He was the last person in Kansas to be sent to fight in the Vietnam War, although he never saw action there. Context: An aspiring writer and obsessive fan, James began writing baseball articles after leaving the United States Army in his mid-twenties. Many of his first baseball writings came while he was doing night shifts as a security guard at the Stokely-Van Camp's pork and beans cannery. Unlike most writers, his pieces did not recount games in epic terms or offer insights gleaned from interviews with players. A typical James piece posed a question (e.g., \\"Which pitchers and catchers allow runners to steal the most bases?\\"), and then presented data and analysis written in a lively, insightful, and witty style that offered an answer.  Editors considered James's pieces so unusual that few believed them suitable for their readers. In an effort to reach a wider audience, James began self-publishing an annual book titled The Bill James Baseball Abstract beginning in 1977. The first edition, titled 1977 Baseball Abstract: Featuring 18 categories of statistical information that you just can't find anywhere else, presented 68 pages of in-depth statistics compiled from James's study of box scores from the preceding season and was offered for sale through a small advertisement in The Sporting News. Seventy-five people purchased the booklet. The 1978 edition, subtitled The 2nd annual edition of baseball's most informative and imaginative review, sold 250 copies. Beginning in 1979, James wrote an annual preview of the baseball season for Esquire, and continued to do so through 1984.  The first three editions of the Baseball Abstract garnered respect for James's work, including a very favorable review by Daniel Okrent in Sports Illustrated. New annual editions added essays on teams and players. By 1982 sales had increased tenfold, and a media conglomerate agreed to publish and distribute future editions.  While writers had published books about baseball statistics before (most notably Earnshaw Cook's Percentage Baseball, in the 1960s), few had ever reached a mass audience. Attempts to imitate James's work spawned a flood of books and articles that continues to this day. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Hey there little buddy! Let me tell you a short story about a man named James who loved baseball. James was from a place called Kansas, and when he was five, his mother passed away. He would later go to college and then join the army. James was really interested in writing about baseball, a game he enjoyed a lot. So, after he left the army, he started writing about it, but instead of talking about the games, he asked fun questions like, \\"Which player lets others steal the most bases?\\" Then, he found out the answers using lots and lots of numbers. At first, not many people wanted to read his writings because they thought it was too different. So, James decided to make his own books and sell them. Every year, he made a new book about baseball, and more people kept buying them. His writing became very popular, and soon others wanted to write like him using numbers and asking interesting questions about baseball. To answer your question, the interesting thing about this story is how James found a new way to write about baseball using numbers, and he became really popular because of it.

Last month, three women told Patheos , a religion and spirituality website, that Tyson harassed them and made inappropriate sexual advances as early as 1984 and in recent years.      \\"Accusations can damage a reputation and a marriage. Sometimes irreversibly. I see myself as loving husband and as a public servant -- a scientist and educator who serves at the will of the public. I am grateful for the support I've received from those who continue to respect and value me and my work,\\" he wrote in a lengthy Facebook post titled \\"On Being Accused.\\"      Tyson disputed or offered a different version of the allegations against him.      Katelyn N. Allers, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, told Patheos that Tyson grabbed her arm and reached into her dress while looking at her tattoo of the solar system. She said the incident happened during a party after a gathering of the American Astronomical Society in 2009.      While their interaction may have not been an assault, Allers said it was a clear sign that Tyson was capable of \\"creepy behavior,\\" the website reported.      \\"My experience with him is he's not someone who has great respect for female bodily autonomy,\\" she told Patheos.      Tyson, the host of the 2014 series \\"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,\\" said he didn't know Allers felt uncomfortable by his behavior.      He said his action \\"was simply a search (for the tattoo) under the covered part of her shoulder of the sleeveless dress.\\"      \\"I only just learned (nine years after) that she thought this behavior creepy,\\" he wrote. \\"That was never my intent and I'm deeply sorry to have made her feel that way.\\"      Another woman, Ashley Watson, told the website that she quit her job as Tyson's assistant last summer after he attempted to persuade her into sex.      Watson told Patheos that she felt pressured to impress her boss and accepted an invitation from Tyson to his place. There, the scientist spoke about people needing human physical releases and gave her an \\"awkward and incredibly intimate handshake.\\"      Later, when she was leaving, \\"Tyson then allegedly put his hands on her shoulders, and said he wanted to hug her, but if he did, he'd 'just want more,'\\" the website reported.      In his post, Tyson described multiple interactions with his female production assistant, including inviting her to his place for wine and cheese during the last week of production. He said the woman later told him that she was \\"creeped out\\" and viewed the invitation as an attempt to seduce her. After he apologized profusely, the woman said that would be her last day working there.

A third woman , Tchiya Amet, alleges Tyson drugged and raped her in 1984 while they were graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin.

In his post, Tyson also welcomed an investigation by the networks.      CNN has reached out to both networks for comment.

Emotions bypass due-process, people choose sides, and the social media wars begin.      In any claim, evidence matters. Evidence always matters. But what happens when it’s just one person’s word against another’s, and the stories don’t agree? That’s when people tend to pass judgment on who is more credible than whom. And that’s when an impartial investigation can best serve the truth – and would have my full cooperation to do so.      I’ve recently been publically accused of sexual misconduct. These accusations have received a fair amount of press in the past forty-eight hours, unaccompanied by my reactions. In many cases, it’s not the media’s fault. I declined comment on the grounds that serious accusations should not be adjudicated in the press. But clearly I cannot continue to stay silent. So below I offer my account of each accusation.      The 2009 Incident      I am asked by thousands of people per year to take pictures with them. A flattering, time consuming, but delightful chore. As many in my fan-base can attest, I get almost giddy if I notice you’re wearing cosmic bling – clothing or jewelry or tattoos that portray the universe, either scientifically or artistically. And I make it a priority to point out these adornments for the photograph.      A colleague at a well attended, after-conference, social gathering came up to me to ask for a photograph. She was wearing a sleeveless dress with a tattooed solar system extending up her arm. And while I don’t explicitly remember searching for Pluto at the top of her shoulder, it is surely something I would have done in that situation. As we all know, I have professional history with the demotion of Pluto, which had occurred officially just three years earlier. So whether people include it or not in their tattoos is of great interest to me. I was reported to have “groped” her by searching “up her dress”, when this was simply a search under the covered part of her shoulder of the sleeveless dress.      I only just learned (nine years after) that she thought this behavior creepy. That was never my intent and I’m deeply sorry to have made her feel that way. Had I been told of her discomfort in the moment, I would have offered this same apology eagerly, and on the spot. In my mind’s eye, I’m a friendly and accessible guy, but going forward, I can surely be more sensitive to people’s personal space, even in the midst of my planetary enthusiasm.      Summer 2018 Incident      While filming this past summer, I had a (female) Production Assistant assigned to me, to ensure, among her countless tasks, that every ounce of my energy was efficiently allocated to the production needs of the show. As part of this, she was also my driver, to and from the studio, ensuring that I arrive on time. In the car we would review details of the shoot and she would help me anticipate parts of the shoot to come. Across the many weeks of shooting she and I spent upwards of a hundred hours in one-on-one conversation. We became so friendly that we talked about all manner of subjects, even social-personal ones, like the care of aging parents, sibling relationships, life in high school and college, hometown hobbies, race, gender, and so forth. We also discussed less-personal topics in abundance, like rock lyrics, favorite songs in various musical genres, concert experiences, etc. And we also talked about food – I’m kind of a foodie, and her fiancé was a chef. In short, we had a fun, talkative friendship.      She is a talented, warm and friendly person -- excellent traits for morale on a high pressure production. Practically everyone she knows on set gets a daily welcome-hug from her. I expressly rejected each hug offered frequently during the Production. But in its place I offered a handshake, and on a few occasions, clumsily declared, “If I hug you I might just want more.” My intent was to express restrained but genuine affection.      In the final week of shooting, with just a few days left, as a capstone of our friendship, I invited her to wine & cheese at my place upon dropping me off from work. No pressure. I serve wine & cheese often to visitors. And I even alerted her that others from the production were gathering elsewhere that evening, so she could just drop me off and head straight there or anywhere else. She freely chose to come by for wine & cheese and I was delighted. In the car, we had started a long conversation that could continue unabated. Production days are long. We arrived late, but she was on her way home two hours later.      Afterwards, she came into my office and told me she was creeped out by the wine & cheese evening. She viewed the invite as an attempt to seduce her, even though she sat across the wine & cheese table from me, and all conversation had been in the same vein as all other conversations we ever had.      Further, I never touched her until I shook her hand upon departure. On that occasion, I had offered a special handshake, one I learned from a Native elder on reservation land at the edge of the Grand Canyon. You extend your thumb forward during the handshake to feel the other person’s vital spirit energy -- the pulse. I’ve never forgotten that handshake, and I save it in appreciation of people with whom I’ve developed new friendships.      At that last meeting in my office, I apologized profusely. She accepted the apology. And I assured her that had I known she was uncomfortable, I would have apologized on the spot, ended the evening, and possibly reminded her of the other social gathering that she could attend. She nonetheless declared it her last day, with only a few days left of production.      I note that her final gesture to me was the offer of a hug, which I accepted as a parting friend.      Early 1980s      I entered astrophysics graduate school directly out of college in 1980. It’s a grueling adventure-marathon, and many people do not finish the PhD. In fact, it was not uncommon for half the admitted students to leave after two or three years, finding some other kind of work in their lives. While in graduate school I had several girlfriends, one of whom would become my wife of thirty years, a mathematical physicist -- we met in Relativity class. Over this time I had a brief relationship with a fellow astro-graduate student, from a more recent entering class. I remember being intimate only a few times, all at her apartment, but the chemistry wasn’t there. So the relationship faded quickly. There was nothing otherwise odd or unusual about this friendship.      I didn't see much of her after that time. Our student offices were on different floors of the building and we were not in the same classes. A few years later, I ran into her, pregnant, with who I think was the father by her side. That’s when I had learned that she had dropped out of graduate school. Again, this is not itself an unusual fact, but I nonetheless wished her well in motherhood and in whatever career path would follow.      More than thirty years later, as my visibility-level took another jump, I read a freshly posted blog accusing me of drugging and raping a woman I did not recognize by either photo or name. Turned out to be the same person who I dated briefly in graduate school. She had changed her name and lived an entire life, married with children, before this accusation.      For me, what was most significant, was that in this new life, long after dropping out of astrophysics graduate school, she was posting videos of colored tuning forks endowed with vibrational therapeutic energy that she channels from the orbiting planets. As a scientist, I found this odd. Meanwhile, according to her blog posts, the drug and rape allegation comes from an assumption of what happened to her during a night that she cannot remember. It is as though a false memory had been implanted, which, because it never actually happened, had to be remembered as an evening she doesn’t remember. Nor does she remember waking up the next morning and going to the office. I kept a record of everything she posted, in case her stories morphed over time. So this is sad, which, for me, defies explanation.      I note that this allegation was used as a kind of solicitation-bait by at least one journalist to bring out of the woodwork anybody who had any encounter with me that left them uncomfortable.      Overview      I’m the accused, so why believe anything I say? Why believe me at all?      That brings us back to the value of an independent investigation, which FOX/NatGeo (the networks on which Cosmos and StarTalk air) announced that they will conduct. I welcome this.      Accusations can damage a reputation and a marriage. Sometimes irreversibly. I see myself as loving husband and as a public servant – a scientist and educator who serves at the will of the public. I am grateful for the support I’ve received from those who continue to respect and value me and my work.

The main subjects here are South Korea and MERS cases. 2. \\"South Korean woman in contact with MERS patient dies\\": This sentence tells about a South Korean woman dying after being in contact with a MERS patient. The subjects here are the South Korean woman and the MERS patient. Let's evaluate the textual similarity based on the following parameters: - Topic of the sentences: Both sentences deal with the topic of MERS in South Korea, which gives them some similarity. - Central idea of the sentences: The first sentence is about new cases reported, whereas the second is about the death of a woman who was in contact with a MERS patient. Although they both relate to MERS, the central ideas are different. - Contextual similarity: The context is South Korea dealing with MERS. However, the specific situations addressed in the two sentences (reporting new cases vs. woman dying after contact with MERS patient) vary significantly.  Considering all of these factors, it seems the sentences have a low to medium level of overlap. They discuss the same general topic, but pertain to different specific circumstances related to that topic.

Another reason for keeping your grip at or beyond shoulder width is to minimize the distance you'll need to swing during the toes-to-bar.. Explanation:  Option (d) is the most appropriate next step as it provides relevant advice to the action of performing a toes-to-bar exercise. Here, the grip width is highlighted. If the hands are too closely aligned with the feet, there could be a risk of accidentally kicking them which would lead to a weaker grip.

Option (a) suggests not needing a specific size for tighter kicks which is vague and doesn't seem to connect directly to executing a toes-to-bar move. Option (b) talks about pressing the bar which is unclear in the context of performing a toes-to-bar. Option (c) talks about tightening the core muscles on hands and upper arms, but in a toes-to-bar exercise, the focus is primarily on the abdominal muscles, making this advice less relevant for the specific exercise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The question is asking which surface, the beach or the parking lot, has less friction.  Step 3: Recall the relationship between friction and speed. Friction is the force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact. When there is less friction, there is less resistance to motion, allowing for higher speeds. Step 4: Apply the context of the story to the question. Since Little Timmy has to ride his bike at a reduced speed on the beach, it indicates that there is more friction on the beach compared to the parking lot. Step 5: Determine the most sensible answer. Since there is more friction on the beach, it means that the parking lot has less friction. Answer: parking lot"},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Paterson introduced legislation on Wednesday to begin overhauling New York’s troubled juvenile prison system, in what aides described at a first step toward broader changes long sought by critics of the system. The legislation would prohibit judges from placing youths in state juvenile prisons unless they had been found guilty of a violent felony or a sex crime or a judge had determined that a youth posed a significant risk to themselves or others. Such a move would set the stage to significantly shrink the number of youths in state custody. The bill would also establish an independent office to monitor and, where necessary, investigate problems at the state’s youth prisons, which are run by the state’s Office of Children and Family Services. “We have a responsibility to provide the highest level of care to the children in the custody of the state,” Governor Paterson said in a statement. “This bill will create a mechanism for ensuring that systemwide issues are evaluated by an independent body and that only youth who have committed certain crimes or who are deemed to be a significant risk to public safety are placed with O.C.F.S.” Both are steps recommended last year by a task force appointed by Mr. Paterson and led by Jeremy Travis, president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. The task force found that New York’s juvenile prisons were broken almost beyond repair, with young people battling mental illness or addiction held alongside violent offenders in abysmal facilities where they received little counseling or schooling and sometimes faced physical abuse at the hands of guards. The problems are so severe that the United States Department of Justice threatened last year to take over the entire state system unless New York officials moved to fix them.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: How serious or lighthearted do you want the eulogy to be? A good eulogy does not need to be uniformly somber, just appropriate. Some eulogy-writers take a serious approach, others are bold enough to add humor. Used cautiously, humor can help convey the personality of the deceased and illustrate some of his or her endearing qualities. The tone can also be partially determined by the way the deceased passed away. If you're giving a eulogy about a teenager who met an untimely death, then your tone would be more serious than it would if you were giving a eulogy about a grandparent who happily lived to see his ninetieth birthday. Write the eulogy with the deceased's family and loved ones in mind. Dwell on the positive, but be honest. If the person was difficult or inordinately negative, avoid talking about that or allude to it gently, as in \\"He had his demons, which were a constant battle.\\" Make sure you don't say anything that would offend, shock, or confuse the audience. For example, don't make any jokes or comments about the deceased that would be a mystery to the majority of the crowd. Even if most people in the audience know you, it's still important to introduce yourself.  If you're related to the deceased, describe how; if not, say a few words about how and when you met. Though your eulogy doesn't have to read like an obituary or give all of the basic information about the life of the deceased, you should touch on a few key points, such as what his family life was like, what his career achievements were, and what hobbies and interests mattered the most to him. You can find a way of mentioning this information while praising or remembering the deceased.  Write down the names of the family members especially closed to the deceased. You may forget their names on the big day because you're overwhelmed by sadness, so it's advisable to have them on hand. Make sure you say something specific about the family life of the deceased -- this would be very important to his family. Avoid reciting a list of qualities that the person possesses. Instead, mention a quality and then illustrate it with a story. It is the stories that bring the person--and that quality--to life. Talk to as many people as you can to get their impressions, memories, and thoughts about the deceased, and then write down as many memories of your own as you can. Look for a common theme that unites your ideas, and try to illustrate this theme through specific examples.  If the deceased is remembered for being kind, talk about the time he helped a homeless man get back on his feet. If the deceased is known for being a prankster, mention his famous April Fool's prank. Pretend that a stranger is listening to your eulogy. Would he get a good sense of the person you're describing without ever meeting him just from your words? Outline the eulogy before you start writing. Brainstorm all the possible areas (personality traits, interests, biographical info) to talk about and write them down. When you're ready to write, cover each area in a logical order. Give the eulogy a beginning, middle, and end. Avoid rambling or, conversely, speaking down to people. You may have a sterling vocabulary, but dumb it down for the masses just this once. The average eulogy is about 3-5 minutes long. That should be enough for you to give a meaningful speech about the deceased. Remember that less is more; you don't want to try the patience of the audience during such a sad occasion. Once you're written the eulogy and feel fairly confident in what you've written, have some close friends or family members who know the deceased well read it to make sure that it's not only accurate, but that it does well with capturing the essence of the deceased. They'll also be able to see if you've said anything inappropriate, forgotten something important, or wrote anything that was confusing or difficult to understand. You can also ask your friends or family members to edit your eulogy. Though it doesn't need to have perfect grammar since no one else will be reading it, your friends or family members can help you add smoother transitions or remove repetitive phrasing. Summary:","output":"The article provides detailed guidance on how to write a meaningful and appropriate eulogy, suggesting the incorporation of humor, personal stories, and audience consideration, all the while maintaining a tone fitting to the deceased's life and manner of passing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the person who drew Man of Sorrows? ?  The three-quarter view was widely used in southern German portraiture of the late-15th century. Rosary beads were often included to indicate the piousness and modesty of the sitters, although by the 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion. Dürer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents' faces, a technique that draws comparison to the work of the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters active 50 years earlier. Albrecht the Elder had travelled to Flanders and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden.  That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of silverpoint, a medium which according to Erwin Panofsky requires \\"an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling\\". Dürer would have been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Von Fircks believes the portrait of Dürer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a \\"highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation\\".Von Fircks notes that Dürer's 1484 self-portrait was created with the use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self-portrait; the 1500 Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight. From these she concludes that the \\"accurate observation and documentary recording\\" of both his own and his parents' appearances over time was not just a compulsion, but that is indicative of a deeper interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance. Although Dürer was fascinated by the effects of ageing on others, he seems to have had some hesitancy at examining how it might affect him personally. The...

Article: The defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1922) began with the Second Constitutional Era, a moment of hope and promise established with the Young Turk Revolution. It restored the Ottoman constitution of 1876 and brought in multi-party politics with a two-stage electoral system (electoral law) under the Ottoman parliament. The constitution offered hope by freeing the empire’s citizens to modernize the state’s institutions, rejuvenate its strength, and enable it to hold its own against outside powers. Its guarantee of liberties promised to dissolve inter-communal tensions and transform the empire into a more harmonious place. Instead, this period became the story of the twilight struggle of the Empire. Young Turks movement members once underground (named committee, group, etc.) established (declared) their parties. Among them “Committee of Union and Progress,” and “Freedom and Accord Party” were major parties. On the other end of the spectrum were ethnic parties which included; Poale Zion, Al-Fatat, and Armenian national movement organized under Armenian Revolutionary Federation. Profiting from the civil strife, Austria-Hungary officially annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908. The last of Ottoman censuses was performed with the 1914 census. Ottoman military reforms resulted with the Ottoman Modern Army which engaged with Italo-Turkish War (1911), Balkan Wars (1912–1913), and continuous unrest (Counter coup followed by restoration and Saviors followed by Raid on Porte) in the Empire up to World War I.

We know we can close the gap. It’s been done or almost been done before in Scottish education, but the answers have been ignored as they pass us by. The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university. Boyd borrowed from his own mother’s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother’s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent. What kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland? What do we value in our assessment system? Opening up opportunity for all is a tough game to play when the examination system rewards only certain types of behaviour, few of them related to what the Curriculum for Excellence says we stand for. In his own small community in East Kilbride, three secondary schools enter a period of meltdown as the local rag sets about creating its own local league table of performance, with those three ‘teams’ in competition for the top spot (or at least not the bottom one). Therefore, we must stop basing “the gap” largely on attainment. First of all, Boyd would like us to remove the traditional, and non-sensical academic/vocational divide.

The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is Shelldrake's follproof plan? , can you please find it?   Young filmmaker Stevie Horowitz eagerly awaits a meeting with big shot Hollywood film producer J.P. Shelldrake. Shelldrake has been desperately searching for a way to avoid problems with the IRS and unpaid millions owed them in back taxes. His brilliant yet overpaid accountant devises a scheme to allow the producer to write off the expenses of his next movie release, but only if the film is a box office flop. Armed with his foolproof plan, Shelldrake agrees to meet with Stevie and screen his film \\"Lobster Man From Mars\\" (financed by Stevie's jailed con man Uncle Joey). The plot resembles the premise of The Producers by Mel Brooks. Inside Shelldrake's private screening room, the \\"film within the film\\" begins. They watch the weird plot unfold: Mars suffers from a severe air leakage. The King of Mars commands the dreaded Lobster Man and his assistant Mombo, a gorilla wearing a space helmet, to pilot his flying saucer to Earth then steal its air. Once landed, the Lobster Man wastes no time transforming hapless victims into smoking skeletons. On a lonely road, John and Mary, a young and innocent couple discovers the hiding place of the flying saucer in a dark and mysterious cave. They attempt to warn the authorities but are ignored. Successfully contacting Professor Plocostomos, a plan is created to lure the Lobster Man to Mr. Throckmorton's Haunted House that just happens to be surrounded by boiling hot springs.  Once lured, it is simply a matter of pushing the Lobster Man into the hot water where he will be boiled to death. The plan is interrupted by Colonel Ankrum and his troops. The house is shelled and destroyed, the Lobster Man flees to his cave, taking Mary with him. Answer:","output":"Shelldrake's foolproof plan is to produce a box office flop in order to write off the expenses of his next movie release and avoid problems with the IRS and unpaid millions owed in back taxes.

Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Context: A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in a planet's surface from which geothermally heated water issues. Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places, areas where tectonic plates are moving apart, ocean basins, and hotspots. Hydrothermal vents exist because the earth is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust. Common land types include hot springs, fumaroles and geysers. Under the sea, hydrothermal vents may form features called black smokers. Relative to the majority of the deep sea, the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive, often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids. Chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea form the base of the food chain, supporting diverse organisms, including giant tube worms, clams, limpets and shrimp. Active hydrothermal vents are believed to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus, and it is speculated that ancient hydrothermal vents once existed on Mars., Worms are many different distantly related animals that typically have a long cylindrical tube-like body and no limbs. Worms vary in size from microscopic to over in length for marine polychaete worms (bristle worms), for the African giant earthworm, \\"Microchaetus\\", and for the marine nemertean worm (bootlace worm), \\"Lineus longissimus\\". Various types of worm occupy a small variety of parasitic niches, living inside the bodies of other animals. Free-living worm species do not live on land, but instead live in marine or freshwater environments, or underground by burrowing., Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists., Canalipalpata, also known as bristle-footed annelids or fan-head worms, is an infraclass of polychaete worms, with 31 families in it including the Sabellida (tubeworms, fanworms, and feather duster worms) and the Alvinellidae, a family of deep-sea worms associated with hydrothermal vents. , The Alvinellidae are a family of small, deep-sea polychaete worms endemic to hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean. Belonging to the order Terebellida, the family contains two genera, Alvinella and Paralvinella; the former genus contains two valid species and the latter eight. Members of the family are termed alvinellids., The Polychaeta or polychaetes are a paraphyletic class of annelid worms, generally marine. Each body segment has a pair of fleshy protrusions called parapodia that bear many bristles, called chaetae, which are made of chitin. Indeed, polychaetes are sometimes referred to as bristle worms. More than 10,000 species are described in this class. Common representatives include the lugworm (\\"Arenicola marina\\") and the sandworm or clam worm \\"Alitta\\"., Sabellida is a suborder of annelid worms in the class Polychaeta. They are filter feeders with no buccal organ. The prostomium is fused with the peristomium and bears a ring of feathery feeding tentacles. They live in parchment-like tubes made of particles from their environment such as sand and shell fragments cemented together with mucus. Members of the suborder include the feather duster worms (Sabellidae) and serpulid worms (Serpulidae). Among the species are the giant feather duster worm (\\"Eudistylia polymorpha\\"), the peacock worm (\\"Sabella pavonina\\"), the European fan worm (\\"Sabella spallanzanii\\") and the Christmas tree worm (\\"Spirobranchus giganteus\\")., The Saccocirridae are small interstitial polychaetes common in coarse sand on reflective , surf beaches , usually within the zone of retention . The Saccociridae are members of the clade Protodrilida , which is in turn part of the clade Canalipalpata . Saccocirridae have a world wide distribution and many more species likely remain to be described . These polychates are usually between 2 and 10 mm in length and 500 m wide . They have reduced parapodia and are considered a true interstitial species , incapable of burrowing through finer sediments ., A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\"., Subject: saccocirridae, Relation: taxon_rank, Options: (A) branch (B) class (C) family (D) form (E) group (F) infraclass (G) species (H) suborder (I) variety","output":"Based on the context provided, the object entity related to the subject (saccocirridae) with the given relation (taxon_rank) is (C) family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which star has more hydrogen reactions in its core?  Two stars have just been discovered that are identical in terms of chemical composition. The scientist who discovered them was given the right to name them, and he chose the names Enterprise and Vader. As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not. Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them.  Hint: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star. After a few more million years, the star evolves into a white dwarf-planetary nebula system. A:","output":"The star Enterprise has more hydrogen reactions in its core. This is because the given paragraph states that Vader is a red giant star, which is in the last phase of its life. During this phase, hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  RNA is studied to understand gene expression patterns in cells. RNA is naturally very unstable because enzymes that break down RNA are commonly present in nature. Some are even secreted by our own skin and are very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA extraction, RNA extraction involves the use of various buffers and enzymes to inactivate other macromolecules and preserve only the RNA. Gel Electrophoresis Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or alkaline pH in an aqueous environment, they can be moved by an electric field. Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate charged molecules on the basis of size and charge. The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or as fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot at one end of a gel matrix, an electric current is applied, and negatively charged molecules are pulled toward the opposite end of the gel (the end with the positive electrode). Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. The nucleic acids in a gel matrix are invisible until they are stained with a compound that allows them to be seen, such as a dye. Distinct fragments of nucleic acids appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) that are based on their size (Figure 10.3). A mixture of many fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel.

The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study on the negative effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health. Sugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice were 26% less territorial and produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice. Scientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic  structure to humans. \\"Since most substances that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\\" says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can change development and even shorten lives. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation's sugar desire will provide for a truly sweeter future.

Given the following context:  Hope is traditionally considered by Christians as a theological virtue (a virtue associated with the grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless. In late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that \\"I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them.\\" Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter Evelyn De Morgan, drew on the imagery of Psalm 137 and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, Edward Burne-Jones, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the cartoon for a planned stained glass window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in Hopton-on-Sea. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a flowering rod.Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person that completed Hope relatively quickly?","output":"The text does not provide a clear indication of the name of a person who completed \\"Hope\\" relatively quickly.

I wore mine once & within an hour of having them on the fabric was tearing away from the seam at the top so beware! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the product review to identify any positive or negative aspects mentioned about the product. In the given review, there are both positive and negative aspects mentioned: Positive aspect: The panties are described as \\"very beautiful.\\" Negative aspect: The panties are described as \\"cheap made\\" and the fabric tears away from the seam after just an hour of wearing. Step 2: Weigh the importance of the positive and negative aspects in the context of the product. In this case, the appearance (being beautiful) is a positive aspect, but it is less important than the quality and durability of the product, which are negative aspects. The fact that the fabric tears away from the seam after such a short period of wearing indicates significant issues with the product's functionality and performance. Step 3: Determine whether the product review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light based on the importance of the positive and negative aspects.

For those people, her life and her success are a good example. She has struggled with many of the challenges that we all face, and she has changed her life. Her message is powerful: I did it, and so can you. Oprah Winfrey is a black woman whose becoming famous is an encouraging story. She was born on January 29, 1954 in a small village in America. Her patents were very poor. For her family, life seemed to hold no promise. But there was nothing that could stop Oprah. She was an extremely bright girl at school. She asked her kindergarten teacher to let her go to school sooner and she also skipped  the second grade of primary school . Her life from the age of six till about fourteen was very hard. For many women such difficulty would be too heavy to bear . But not for Oprah. When she was fourteen, Oprah went to live with her father. Her father showed her how hard work and discipline  could lead to self-improvement. Oprah listened to her father, and a few years later she won a college scholarship that allowed her to go to university. Two years later, after graduation, she started working for television.

Given the below context:  Florence Fuller was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in 1867, a daughter of Louisa and John Hobson Fuller. She had several siblings, including sisters Amy and Christie, both of whom subsequently became singers. The family migrated to Australia when Florence was a child. She worked as a governess while undertaking studies in art, and first took classes at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School in 1883, then again for a further term of study in 1888. During this period she was a student of Jane Sutherland, referred to in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as \\"the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who broke with the nineteenth-century tradition of studio art by sketching and painting directly from nature\\".Fuller's uncle was Robert Hawker Dowling, a painter of orientalist and Aboriginal subjects, as well as portraits and miniatures. British-born, he had grown up in Tasmania and made a living there as a portraitist, before returning to his native England at age thirty. For the next two decades, his works were frequently hung at the Royal Academy. He returned to Australia in 1885, and Fuller became his pupil. In that year, aged eighteen, Fuller received a commission from Ann Fraser Bon, philanthropist and supporter of Victoria's Aboriginal people. The commission was for Barak–last chief of the Yarra Yarra Tribe of Aborigines, a formal oil on canvas portrait of the Indigenous Australian leader, William Barak. Ultimately, that painting was acquired by the State Library of Victoria. Although the painting is an important work regularly used to illustrate this significant figure in Australia's history, interpretations of Fuller's portrait are mixed: one critic noted the painting's objectivity and avoidance of romanticising Aboriginal people, while another concluded that \\"Fuller is painting an ideal rather than a person\\".In 1886, Dowling returned to his native England.

Here is an article: Yahoo played the unwitting host to a week's worth of malware-laden scams in what may be the largest attack of its kind in months, security firm Malwarebytes claimed. Researchers said the attackers infiltrated the web portal's advertising network and planted traps on its homepage — along with its sports, finance, celebrity and games sites. When visitors came by the sites, the ads discreetly downloaded malware files to the visitor's computer, either directly from the webpage or from a harmful site to which the ads diverted visitors. The batch of parasitic ads first appeared on the site last Tuesday and may have affected millions of Yahoo users in the ensuing week, according to the firm, though only Yahoo can gauge the exact count. In a statement, Yahoo said that it had successfully shut down the offending advertisers after the firm alerted it to the problem. The company also charged the firm with exaggerating the extent of the threat. \\"We take all potential security threats seriously,\\" a Yahoo spokesperson said in an emailed statement (see below for the full text). \\"With that said, the scale of the attack was grossly misrepresented in initial media reports and we continue to investigate the issue.\\" Yahoo did not respond to Mashable's requests to explain the accusation or reveal the number of visitors hit. The scam appeared to be the work of the same cybercriminal group that has orchestrated a number of similar large-scale attacks, according to Malwarebytes' senior researcher Jérôme Segura, who authored the company's blog post on the attack. The campaign is the latest in a rash of attacks that use ad networks — the platforms websites use to peddle millions of page views each day to interested advertisers — to buy up tracts of page space and camouflage downloadable malware behind the veneer of an advertisement. They then burrow the malware into their favorite pressure point: out-of-date versions of Adobe Flash. Once tainted with snippets of this code, the ubiquitous graphics plug-in, notoriously rife with security holes unless fully updated, becomes a command post from which hackers stealthily channel the host browser's traffic to websites that pay them for the views or even hold programs hostage until their weary owner coughs up a payment — an extortionary device known as ransomware. One need not even click on the ad in question to fall pray; Rather, most spring to life upon the visitor's arrival, Segura told Mashable. These tactics — along with a toolbox of other advertising cons — have become a scourge of the free consumer internet, where ads are the lifeblood of millions of websites. Fraudulent ads rob the industry of an estimated 11 billion each year in wasted spending. With an estimated 6.9 billion visitors to its homepage each month, Yahoo is the fifth most popular destination on the web, according to its Alexa Ranking. The infected auxilary sites, which are among the company's most trafficked, similarly rack up millions of visitors each month. While the behemoth size of the target made it one of the most insidious attacks in a long while, chasing game this big is not unprecedented for this class of cybercriminal, said David Sendroff, founder and CEO of ad fraud detection firm Forensiq. Like any web-based outfit, fraudsters are in the business of trawling for clicks, and they tend to go where supply is most plentiful. \\"Bad actors look for outlets with the widest distribution and large networks are a primary target,\\" Sendroff said in an email. In fact, bigger sites might actually have accordingly bigger targets on their backs. The sheer volume of transactions that whirl through a digital ad marketplace on any given day make policing them close to impossible. Even if one were to inspect each one, ads can easily disguise as legitimate until they are through the gate — and the majority do. \\"Yahoo is dealing with an advertiser it's dealt with for a number of years, that it trusts,\\" Segura says, laying out one hypothetical scenario. \\"And all of a sudden the advertiser pushes a malignant ad. How do your react to this? Do you ban the advertiser you've been doing business with for a number of years? It can be quite tricky.\\" Segura said prize quarry for these hackers include news and media sites and porn sites — spots where visitors are constantly coming and going. At the end of the day, Segura said, the foundation of a full-stop solution will be the personal security walls of each web surfer. (He of course works for a malware-protection software maker, so he does stand to benefit from his prescription.) \\"If you want to take a stab at this issue, you've got to start there,\\" Segura said. \\"You've got to make it more difficult for malware to compromise machines with these sort of attacks.\\" Personal protections, however, can sometimes cause advertisers even more headache. As ad blocking software grows more popular, more Internet users are opting to cut off the spigot to advertising altogether, a trend that could pose a major threat to publishers' revenue if it continues. Incidents like these only reinforce the desire to cut out ads. See Yahoo's full statement below: Yahoo is committed to ensuring that both our advertisers and users have a safe and reliable experience. As soon as we learned of this issue, our team took action to block this advertiser from our network. We take all potential security threats seriously. With that said, the scale of the attack was grossly misrepresented in initial media reports and we continue to investigate the issue. Unfortunately, disruptive ad behavior affects the entire tech industry. Yahoo has a long history of engagement on this issue and is committed to working with our peers to create a secure advertising experience. We’ll continue to ensure the quality and safety of our ads through our automated testing and through the SafeFrame working group, which seeks to protect consumers and publishers from the potential security risks inherent in the online ad ecosystem.

I was the one who reacted very slowly to the green traffic light. When you honked your horn ,I realized I was holding up traffic, so please accept my apology. However, I do want you to know why I seemed in a confused state. You see, I was just at the doctor's office getting the results of the examination I had two weeks ago, and I was wondering how I would tell my husband and children that I had cancer. There were still tears in my eyes, so,quite simply I didn't even see the lights change. Perhaps I should not have been driving, but I didn't want to miss my appointment. I was in the express lane at the supermarket without thinking and moving. Please accept my apology. My mind was on my youngest daughter who ran away from home, and she?'just sixteen. I was so worried then. You see, she somehow got in with the wrong crowd and started using drugs and drinking. I was remembering what a pretty little girl she had been most of her life. I know you were unhappy along with others in line. Please, accept my apology. I remember you from the store last week. I was so mean to you, when you were doing your job to the best of your ability. I acted so childishly. Please accept my apology. You see, I arrived home from work just yesterday and discovered that my wife had left me, but I should never have taken it out on you.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Ever since Canadian psychiatrist Michael R. Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the \\"missing\\" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further. More people's lives can be saved if the authorities adjust to... Question: In Jing's opinion, what should be done to reduce the suicide? Options: A: Pay more attention to rural women. B: Continue to improve social environment. C: Set up more mental health centers. D: Make policies to prevent suicides.

Both groups achieved enormous commercial success and contributed significantly to the development of rock music. Comparing the sales of the two bands, it is widely agreed that The Beatles have sold more records than The Rolling Stones. The Beatles, formed in Liverpool (England) in 1960, are known as the best-selling music act of all time. They consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. The band released more than 200 songs during their career, with dozens of hits, and their music shifted from pop ballads and Indian music to hard rock and psychedelic sounds. The Beatles officially disbanded in 1970, but their influence on music and popular culture has been enduring. It is estimated that they have sold approximately 600 million to over 1 billion units worldwide, including physical and digital sales, singles, albums, videos, and other formats. On the other hand, The Rolling Stones, formed in London (England) in 1962, are known for their long-lasting career and their blues-infused rock 'n' roll sound. Consisting of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, and Ronnie Wood (plus past members Brian Jones, Bill Wyman, and Mick Taylor), they have continuously recorded and toured since their formation, earning the title \\"The World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band.\\" The Rolling Stones have produced countless hits, reflecting various musical styles, from blues and country to disco and punk. Their album sales have been impressive but generally fall short when compared to The Beatles' sales. It is estimated that The Rolling Stones have sold around 240 million to over 300 million units worldwide, considering physical and digital sales, singles, albums, videos, and other formats. To conclude, based on the estimated sales figures, The Beatles have sold more records than The Rolling Stones. This does not necessarily imply that one band is better than the other, as the comparison mainly addresses their commercial achievements. Both bands have left an indelible mark on the history of music and deserve recognition for their respective contributions to the development and evolution of rock music."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

New York City The traditional New York area accent is characterized as non-rhotic, so that the sound [ɹ] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant; hence the pronunciation of the city name as \\"New Yawk.\\" There is no [ɹ] in words like park [pɑək] or [pɒək] (with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the low-back chain shift), butter [bʌɾə], or here [hiə]. In another feature called the low back chain shift, the [ɔ] vowel sound of words like talk, law, cross, chocolate, and coffee and the often homophonous [ɔr] in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in General American. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like \\"girl\\" and of words like \\"oil\\" became a diphthong [ɜɪ]. This would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds, so that girl is pronounced \\"goil\\" and oil is pronounced \\"erl\\"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like \\"Joizey\\" (Jersey), \\"Toidy-Toid Street\\" (33rd St.) and \\"terlet\\" (toilet).

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years.At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.  Now, I have a new situation: Two friends were in college. Hank studied plate tectonics, while his buddy Alex studied Earth's atmosphere. They were both very fascinated by the subjects.  Answer this question please: Which student learned more about mantle convection? Answer:","output":"Hank learned more about mantle convection. Step 1: Identify the subjects each student studied - Hank studied plate tectonics - Alex studied Earth's atmosphere Step 2: Determine which subject is more closely related to mantle convection Mantle convection is a geological process that plays a significant role in driving plate tectonics. It involves the movement of mantle material due to heat transfer from the Earth's core to the surface. This process creates forces that move the tectonic plates, leading to the phenomenon of continental drift. Step 3: Compare the subjects to mantle convection - Plate tectonics: This subject focuses on the movement and interactions of Earth's lithosphere, heavily involving mantle convection as a key driving force. - Earth's atmosphere: This subject centers around the composition, structure, and dynamics of the gaseous envelope surrounding Earth, with minimal connection to mantle convection. Step 4: Determine which student learned more about mantle convection Given that Hank studied plate tectonics, which is intimately linked to mantle convection, it is evident that Hank learned more about mantle convection than Alex, who focused on Earth's atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Hope Bourne's remote, rural lifestyle was at odds with the 20th Century. For more than two decades she shot game for food, grew her own vegetables and lived alone in a leaky caravan without electricity on the open moorlands of Exmoor - all solely due to her sheer willpower, resilience and love of the countryside. She was a well-known figure in Exmoor whose views and knowledge on farming, hunting and wildlife became well-known locally through her popular newspaper column and books. But her colourful character is how she was brought to national attention in the late 70s in the first of two TV documentaries about her life. Now a fresh insight into her life has been unearthed, in the form of a manuscript previously thought of as lost. \\"A Village of the Moor\\" was found in the Exmoor Society's old storeroom during a move to its new premises and has been described as an eloquent insight into village life in the late 1960s. It reveals a world that was in the midst of changing from the traditional to the modern. 'Woman of Exmoor' \\"Farming, hunting, gossip - such as a wedding or funeral - these make the pattern of life here,\\" she writes. \\"The radio and the telly, it is true, bring the wider world into almost every home, but here a hold-up in London or war in the Middle East is of far less importance than yesterday's rain or to-morrow's sheep sale.\\" \\"I found a box labelled Village Survey and it was just sitting there in these little orange folders,\\" said Dr Helen Blackman, the society's senior archivist. \\"To be honest I didn't quite register its significance because I was a few weeks into a new job.\\" The work dates from the time Bourne had temporarily abandoned her self-sufficient lifestyle and moved to Withypool, a village in the heart of Exmoor, to recover from a broken heart. At the time, Bourne would have been in her late 40s, early 50s while the man she had fallen in love with was two decades younger. In the preface, she wrote: \\"Just about three years ago from this time of writing I sustained a complete breakdown due to some very great personal unhappiness and upon recovering found myself, for the time being at least, unable to continue the same way of life.\\" Book publisher Steven Pugsley, who knew Bourne from when he was a child living on Exmoor, said he was was \\"very excited\\" about the discovery. \\"What it is, is Hope's understanding of the place where she lived, peopled by those who she knew and loved and her journey of discovering what her home village was all about,\\" he said. Bourne died aged 91 in August 2010 having never married or had children. \\"In a way Withypool was her husband and children rolled into one and it's almost like a love letter to her surroundings, her environment,\\" said Mr Pugsley. \\"I think as a part of her oeuvres, it's very important. It's an extremely good example of her writing, a very enjoyable piece of writing of Hope at her best.\\" The manuscript is about 60,000 words long with evocative scenes of country life. Of Withypool Hill she wrote: \\"I see it streaked with snow, black and sodden with winter rain, tawny-gold with the bleaching winds of spring and heather-crowned with the purple glory of high summer.\\" There are also affectionate memories of people who she knew and who died in the village. Of her friend May Common, who died in 1960 she described May's dogs as being the \\"chief mourners\\" at her funeral. She added: \\"They followed the coffin into the church and up the aisle to the chancel steps and then sat with May's sisters in the front pew, just as though they understood everything.\\" Normally Bourne, who was also a gifted painter, wrote only using a pencil, storing her mouse-nibbled notes in old tins. The manuscript for a Village on the Moor was typed up by her publisher Victor Bonham Carter but was later rejected as being too contemporaneous. But now - some 45 years later - the manuscript has acquired new value as a piece of social history and is set to be published early next year. \\"She was quite a mass of contradictions in many respects,\\" added Mr Pugsley. \\"She was a very small lady but she was extraordinarily tough. She was a very private woman but she had an awful lot of friends. \\"She had no family but she did have a very wide circle of friends who I think I would say she was mother and sister and sometimes daughter to them.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"Hope Bourne, a woman who chose a remote, rural lifestyle, lived in a leaky caravan on the open moorlands of Exmoor for over two decades during the 20th century. Known for her resilience and love of countryside, she gained local fame for her views and knowledge on farming, hunting, and wildlife, which she shared through her newspaper column and books. Bourne's life was brought to national attention through two TV documentaries in the late 1970s. Recently, a long-lost manuscript, \\"A Village of the Moor,\\" was discovered, providing a fresh insight into her life and village life of the late 1960s. The manuscript, which is set to be published early next year, offers an eloquent view of the changing landscape and lifestyle in that time, and stands as a valuable piece of social history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.  I am facing a new situation today: Hill town was full of gasoline powered vehicles, while Valley town 50 miles away, banned all gas powered vehicles and allows only electrical vehicles or horse-and-buggies.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which town had more evaporated and unused fuel? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the given situation, it can be reasonably concluded that Hill town had more evaporated and unused fuel.  This conclusion stems from the fact that Hill town allows gasoline-powered vehicles to operate within its borders. As mentioned in the article, these vehicles release volatile hydrocarbons into the environment as a result of evaporated and unused fuel. These volatile hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of smog and are a cause of concern for air quality. On the other hand, Valley town has taken a different approach by banning all gasoline-powered vehicles and permitting only electric vehicles and horse-drawn buggies. Electric vehicles, unlike their gasoline counterparts, do not rely on internal combustion engines and therefore produce no emissions stemming from evaporated and unused fuel. Horse-drawn buggies, powered by an animal rather than a combustion engine, also do not have the same evaporative emissions as gasoline-powered vehicles. Given the absence of gasoline-powered vehicles in Valley town and the presence of such vehicles in Hill town, it is clear that Hill town has more evaporated and unused fuel emissions. This is due to the direct relationship between the number of gasoline vehicles and the amount of evaporated and unused fuel released into the atmosphere. Consequently, the town with more gasoline-powered vehicles, in this case Hill town, will experience greater evaporative and unused fuel emissions than a town that has banned these types of vehicles, such as Valley town."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Refraction can be seen when looking into a bowl of water. Air has a refractive index of about 1.0003, and water has a refractive index of about 1.3333. If a person looks at a straight object, such as a pencil or straw, which is placed at a slant, partially in the water, the object appears to bend at the water's surface. This is due to the bending of light rays as they move from the water to the air. Once the rays reach the eye, the eye traces them back as straight lines (lines of sight). The lines of sight (shown as dashed lines) intersect at a higher position than where the actual rays originated. This causes the pencil to appear higher and the water to appear shallower than it really is. The depth that the water appears to be when viewed from above is known as the apparent depth. This is an important consideration for spearfishing from the surface because it will make the target fish appear to be in a different place, and the fisher must aim lower to catch the fish. Conversely, an object above the water has a higher apparent height when viewed from below the water. The opposite correction must be made by an archer fish. For small angles of incidence (measured from the normal, when sin θ is approximately the same as tan θ), the ratio of apparent to real depth is the ratio of the refractive indexes of air to that of water. But, as the angle of incidence approaches 90, the apparent depth approaches zero, albeit reflection increases, which limits observation at high angles of incidence. Conversely, the apparent height approaches infinity as the angle of incidence (from below) increases, but even earlier, as the angle of total internal reflection is approached, albeit the image also fades from view as this limit is approached. Is it true that does water have a lower index of refraction than air?","output":"No, it is not true that water has a lower index of refraction than air. In fact, water has a higher index of refraction than air. The refractive index of a material is a measure of the material's ability to bend, or refract, light. As mentioned in the previous explanation, the refractive index of air is approximately 1.0003, while the refractive index of water is about 1.3333. This means that light travels more slowly in water and bends more as it passes from air into water or vice versa, resulting in the optical illusions and phenomena we observe, such as a pencil appearing bent when submerged in water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\" A:","output":"The non-female role models on the protagonist, Scout, are her father Atticus and her older brother Jem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has... Question: Why do Democrats think Comey get fired by Trump?

If you're feeling depressed on campus , you may find the following tips helpful . Exercise : Physical activity releases endorphins - chemicals that produce an overall positive feeling within the body , which fight depression naturally . Mental health experts claim that exercise is a solution to those feeling mild or moderate depression . However , for those severely depressed , simply doing sports is not enough . Use school counseling services : Campuses don't employ mental health experts simply to throw thousands of dollars down the drain . Their job is to help students , so experts recommend you use them . Most students , however , are hesitant to take a trip to their college's counseling center , fearing being laughed at by peers . As a result , some schools like Texas Christian University , are testing students for mental health problems when they get sick and visit the campus health clinic . Take advantage of technology : Staying in touch with family members and friends from childhood and high school has become easier than ever with the coming of Facebook and video chat services like Skype . While mental health experts insist that it's important to make friends in your new environment and be involved in the college community , it's also significant to keep in touch with the people you knew before college .

In 1979, when I was 5, my family immigrated to the United States. I remember that on my 9th birthday I got my first computer \\"Commodore 64\\". Later I graduated with honors in the University of Maryland in Mathematics and IT. The main field of my science research was the technologies used to collect data from unsystematic sources as well as large quantities of texts and science data. I was the author of dozens of articles in leading American academic magazines. The greatest event in my life happened when in 1998 I was preparing for the defense of my Doctor's degree in Stanford University. There the fate made me meet Larry Page--a young computer genius. Larry belonged to the intellectual society. Larry and I quickly became friends when we worked together. We were searching day and night on the Internet. We were finding a lot of information but with the feeling we still couldn't find enough of what we were looking for. Naturally the idea for a search engine that would allow specific information to be found in the endless pool of data was born like it came to us. It wasn't our plans but we gave up the education at the university. You know the next part, maybe we managed to turn an ordinary garage in Meplo Park, California, the U. S.

His early life and career at Notre Dame were the inspiration for the 1993 film Rudy. Is it true that was the movie rudy based on a true story?","output":"Yes, the movie \\"Rudy\\" is based on the true story of Daniel Eugene \\"Rudy\\" Ruettiger, an inspirational figure who overcame significant challenges to play college football at the University of Notre Dame. His early life and persistence in chasing his dreams served as the basis for the 1993 sports film. Daniel \\"Rudy\\" Ruettiger was born on August 23, 1948, in Joliet, Illinois, into a family of 14 children. Rudy grew up in a devoted Catholic family and was a big fan of Notre Dame football. Despite being smaller in size than most football players and facing the limitations of dyslexia, which affected his academic performance, he was determined to play for the Fighting Irish, Notre Dame's football team. After completing high school, Ruettiger worked in a power plant for a couple of years, and served briefly in the United States Navy before pursuing higher education. He enrolled at Holy Cross Junior College, where he received support for his learning disability. During his time there, Rudy applied to Notre Dame several times, and finally gained admission into the university on his fourth attempt. Once at Notre Dame, Ruettiger made it onto the football team as a walk-on after several unsuccessful attempts, and primarily served on the scout team, playing against the first team offense to help them prepare for upcoming games. Despite his limited playing time, Rudy was well-respected among his teammates and coaches for his commitment, hard work, and sheer determination. Rudy's dream of playing in a game for Notre Dame came true on November 8, 1975, when he was allowed to dress for the last home game of his senior year against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. In the final moments of this game, Rudy was allowed to play and made a tackle on the last play, solidifying his status as a Notre Dame legend. Ruettiger became the first of only two players in the history of Notre Dame football to be carried off the field by their teammates, underscoring the emotional impact of his achievement. The 1993 film \\"Rudy,\\" directed by David Anspaugh and written by Angelo Pizzo, portrays the heartwarming and inspiring story of Rudy Ruettiger's relentless pursuit of his dream of playing football at Notre Dame. The film starred Sean Astin in the titular role and earned both critical acclaim and commercial success, leaving a lasting impression on viewers. While the film does take some creative liberties for the sake of artistic storytelling, it remains an accurate representation of the key aspects of Ruettiger's real-life journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Israeli company offers a free service but on the condition it can use customers' bandwidth \\"securely\\". It also operates a commercial network called Luminati, which can be used to \\"route data through any of our millions of IPs [computer addresses] that are located in every city around the world\\", according to its website. The website goes on to say the Luminati network consists of \\"personal PCs, laptops and mobile devices of participating users\\". They are the private devices of Hola users, it has been claimed. \\"The concern with Hola is that it appears to operate like a botnet, and one that is potentially insecure at that,\\" said cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward, from Surrey University. \\"There is mounting anecdotal evidence that the network is being used as a real botnet. \\"I haven't seen that in practice but the way in which the service can use your machine appears to have the potential to do something like that.\\" Last week, the founder of message board 8Chan said the site had suffered a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack - when a website is overwhelmed by false requests from computers - that could be traced back to the Luminati network. Hola founder Ofer Vilenski confirmed that a hacker had claimed to have used the Luminati network in the attack on 8Chan.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Habitat destruction has played a key role in extinctions, especially in relation to tropical forest destruction. Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\"  I am facing a new situation today: Two continents had different histories.

At the age of 12, Laurent entered the Royal Institution for the Deaf in Paris. After he graduated, the school asked him to stay on as an assistant teacher. Meanwhile, in America, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was studying to be a minister when he met a young deaf girl, Alice Cogswell. He was upset to learn that there were no schools for the deaf in America. Therefore, in 1815, Gallaudet sailed to London to seek ideas on how to teach deaf people. However, he was unable to get help.

Who is  a two-time NHL Second All-Star (2004 and 2007) and a winner of the William M. Jennings Trophy for backstopping his team to the lowest goals-against average in the league, who also was former teamates with a Swedish professional ice hockey centre who currently serves as captain of the Vancouver Canucks? A:","output":"The two-time NHL Second All-Star (2004 and 2007) and winner of the William M. Jennings Trophy for backstopping his team to the lowest goals-against average in the league is Roberto Luongo. Luongo is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender, who played in the NHL for the New York Islanders, Florida Panthers, and Vancouver Canucks.  As for the Swedish professional ice hockey centre who currently serves as captain of the Vancouver Canucks, that player is Bo Horvat. However, Bo Horvat and Roberto Luongo were never teammates. So, let's consider another prominent Swedish player who was a former teammate of Luongo and also played as a centre: Henrik Sedin. Henrik Sedin is a now-retired Swedish professional ice hockey player. He and his twin brother, Daniel Sedin, both played for the Vancouver Canucks for their entire careers (2000-2018). Henrik served as the team's captain, while Daniel was the alternate captain. During their time with the Canucks, they played alongside goaltender Roberto Luongo (2006-2014).  Considering the context of the question, it looks like the Swedish player in question should be Henrik Sedin, making the answer: two-time NHL Second All-Star and William M. Jennings Trophy winner, Roberto Luongo, was former teammates with Swedish professional ice hockey centre, Henrik Sedin, who served as captain of the Vancouver Canucks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: A Long Hike<br>Martha was in the middle of an extremely long hike. She was super tired and getting ready to give up. At this point she was so far in that turning back was useless. She forced herself to trudge through her laziness. When she did finish the hike, she felt thrilled and proud of herself. Hypothesis: Martha was lost in the woods during her hike.","output":"Based on the given context, it would not be accurate to draw the hypothesis that Martha was lost in the woods during her hike. The context does not explicitly state or imply that she was lost. Instead, it provides information on Martha's emotional and physical experiences during the hike. Here's a breakdown of the context and the conclusions that can be drawn from it: 1. Martha was in the middle of an extremely long hike. This statement establishes the setting and the activity that Martha is engaged in. It tells us that the hike was long and challenging, but it does not mention anything about her being lost. 2. She was super tired and getting ready to give up. This statement highlights Martha's physical state during the hike. She was exhausted, perhaps due to the length and difficulty of the hike. This statement still does not imply that she was lost. 3. At this point she was so far in that turning back was useless. This statement reveals that Martha had reached a point in the hike where she felt that turning back would be pointless. It suggests that she had covered a significant distance, but it does not indicate that she was lost or unable to find her way back. 4. She forced herself to trudge through her laziness. This statement displays Martha's determination to overcome her exhaustion and continue with the hike. It shows her resilience and drive in the face of a challenging activity, but it does not mention anything about her being lost. 5. When she did finish the hike, she felt thrilled and proud of herself. This statement indicates that Martha successfully completed the hike and experienced a sense of achievement and satisfaction. It reinforces the idea that she overcame her fatigue and persevered, but it again does not suggest that she was lost during the hike. In conclusion, the context provided does not support the hypothesis that Martha was lost in the woods during her hike. Instead, the context describes her physical and emotional experiences as she engaged in an extremely long hike, her determination to continue despite the exhaustion, and the sense of accomplishment she felt upon completing the hike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: The first legal challenge to the Church of England's ban on same-sex marriage was launched today - months before the first gay wedding can take place. Gay father Barrie Drewitt-Barlow declared: 'I want to go into my church and marry my husband.' He added: 'The only way forward for us now is to make a challenge in the courts against the Church.' The legal move means an early test for David Cameron's promise to the CofE and Roman Catholic bishops that no church would be forced to conduct same-sex weddings against the will of its leaders and its faithful. Barrie (right) Drewitt-Barlow wants to be able to marry his civil-partner Tony (left) in a church. Ministers set down a 'quadruple lock' in the new same sex marriage law - which received Royal Assent last month - which is supposed to protect those churches which oppose gay marriage. However the guarantees will have to be tested in the courts and gay rights groups have been expecting to bring an early challenge. Mr Drewitt-Barlow and his civil partner Tony have been a celebrated couple since 1999, when they became the first gay couple to be named on the birth certificate of a child. They now have five children through surrogate mothers. He said : 'We need to convince the church that it is the right thing for our community for them to recognise us as practising Christians. Tony and Barrie Drewitt-Barlow with their long-distance twins Dallas and Jasper. They now have five children through surrogate mothers. 'I am a Christian - a practising Christian. My children have all been brought up as Christians and are part of the local parish church.' Mr Drewitt-Barlow, 42, who owns a surrogacy company based near the family home in Essex and is opening another in Los Angeles, added: 'If I was a Sikh I could get married at the Gurdwara. Liberal Jews can marry in the Synagogue - just not the Christians. 'It upsets me because I want it so much - a big lavish ceremony, the whole works. He said it was a shame that he and his partner were being forced to take Christians to court to get them to recognise them, but he said the new law did not give them what they have been campaigning for. Mr Drewitt-Barlow, who took out a civil partnership in 2006, added: 'It is like someone giving me a sweetie with the wrapper on and telling me to suck it.' Under the Government's same-sex marriage law, which is expected to lead the first gay wedding next summer, churches must legally opt in before they can conduct same-sex ceremonies. Those that hold objections to gay marriage have been told the quadruple lock will prevent the courts from forcing them to stage gay weddings against the conscience of priests and most congregations.The lock says that no religious organisation could be compelled to marry same-sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises. Barrie holds his newborn daughter, Saffron, at a hospital in Modesto, California in 1999. It would be unlawful for ministers to marry same-sex couples unless their organisation's governing body has opted into provisions for doing so. The Equality Act 2010 would be amended to ensure no discrimination claim could be brought against religious organisations for refusing to marry a same-sex couple. The new law also states that it no religious organisation could be compelled to marry same-sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises. It would be unlawful for ministers to marry same-sex couples unless their organisation's governing body has opted into provisions for doing so. The Equality Act 2010 would be amended to ensure no discrimination claim could be brought against religious organisations for refusing to marry a same-sex couple. The law also states that it is illegal for the Church of England and the Church in Wales to marry same-sex couples. The CofE is also protected by its own internal canon laws, which are part of the law of land, which say marriages must be between a man and a woman. However a succession of past court cases have resulted in defeats for Christians who were in disputes over equality laws, and in particular courts have always found in favour of gays who have challenged Christians. Under the Government's same-sex marriage law, which is expected to lead the first gay wedding next summer, churches must legally opt in before they can conduct same-sex ceremonies. In recent years notable cases have ended in the sacking of a town hall registrar who refused to conduct civil partnership ceremonies, the sack for a Relate counsellor who said he would not give sex advice to gay couples, and defeat for a couple who declined to let a room in their hotel to a gay couple on the grounds that they were unmarried. Colin Hart, of the Coalition for Marriage said: 'The ink's not even dry on the Bill and churches are already facing litigation. We warned Mr Cameron this would happen, we told him he was making promises that he couldn't possibly keep. 'He didn't listen. He didn't care. He's the one who has created this mess. Mr Cameron's chickens are coming home to roost and it will be ordinary people with a religious belief who yet again fall victim to the totalitarian forces of political correctness.' Mr Hart added: 'We now face the real prospect of churches having to choose between stopping conducting weddings, or vicars, and priests defying the law and finding themselves languishing in the dock.'

Answer this question: when was the first handheld mobile phone invented??","output":"The first handheld mobile phone was invented in 1973 by Dr. Martin Cooper, an engineer at Motorola. Dr. Cooper, who is widely recognized as \\"the father of the cell phone,\\" was the first person to make a call using a handheld cellular device on April 3, 1973. At the time, Dr. Cooper was working on creating a portable and personal communication device that could compete with AT&T's car-based mobile telephone system, which was impractical and heavy, weighing around 30-40 pounds. Dr. Cooper's invention aimed at providing people with a more convenient and accessible device that they could carry around in their hands. Motorola's DynaTAC 8000X, the prototype developed by Dr. Cooper, was the first functional handheld mobile phone. The device weighed about 2.4 pounds, had a length of 9 inches, and allowed talk time of approximately 30 minutes before the battery needed to be recharged. It took about 10 hours to fully recharge the DynaTAC 8000X, which was quite a long time compared to today's devices. In addition to its bulky size, the DynaTAC 8000X initially had a very limited set of features, unlike modern smartphones with their myriad capabilities. The device could only be used for making and receiving calls, as well as dialing numbers with the built-in buttons. There was no texting, internet browsing, or camera functionality available in this early cell phone. The DynaTAC 8000X prototype underwent several years of development and testing before it was commercially introduced in 1983. The commercial version had a price tag of approximately 3,995, which is equivalent to nearly 10,000 in today's currency, making it a luxury item available only to a select few. The invention of the handheld mobile phone marked a significant milestone in the history of telecommunications, paving the way for the mobile technology revolution that has greatly shaped the way we communicate, work, and live today. Today's smartphones are a direct result of Dr. Martin Cooper's innovative vision and the technological advancements that have occurred over the past five decades. Modern mobile phones come in various shapes and sizes, and they offer a wide range of crucial features and applications that go far beyond just voice communication, transforming our daily lives and interactions in meaningful ways."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: It does not seem that this movie managed to please a lot of people. First off, not many seem to have seen it in the first place (I just bumped into it by accident), and then judging by the reviews and the rating, of those that did many did not enjoy it very much. Well, I did. I usually tolerate Gere for his looks and his charm, and even though I did not consider him a great actor, I know he can do crazy pretty well (I liked his Mr Jones). But this performance is all different. He is not pretty in this one, and he is not charming. His character is completely different from anything I had seen from him up to that point---old, ugly, broken, determined. And Gere, in what to me is so far his best performance ever, pulls it off beautifully. I guess it is a sign of how well an actor does his job if you cannot imagine anyone else doing it instead---think Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, or Washington as Alonzo in Training Day. That is how good Gere was here. The rest of the cast were fine by me, too. I guess I would not have cast Danes in this role, mostly because I think she is too good-looking for it. But she actually does an excellent job, holding her own with a Gere in top form, which is no small feat. Strickland easily delivers the best supporting act, in a part that requires a considerable range from her. I actually think she owns the key scene with Gere and Danes, and that is quite an achievement. So what about the rest of the movie, apart from some excellent acting? The story is perhaps not hugely surprising, some 8mm-ish aspects to it, but adding the \\"veteran breaks in rookie\\" storyline to the who-dunnit, and also (like Silence of the Lambs) adding a sense of urgency through trying to save the girl and the impending retirement of Gere's character. All that is a backdrop to the development of the two main characters, as they help each other settle into their respective new stations in life. That's a lot to accomplish in a 100 minutes, but it is done well, and we end up caring for the characters and what happens to them. Direction and photography were adequate. I could have done without the modern music-video camera movements and cutting, but then I am an old curmudgeon, and it really wasn't all that bad, in fact I think it did help with the atmosphere of the movie, which as you might have guessed, by and large isn't a happy one.

The coagulation can be caused by adding rennet or any edible acidic substance such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein) to tangle into solid masses, or curds. Milk that has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic acid bacteria) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheeses are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in cheesemaking; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only whey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins.  Paragraph: Dan likes to experiment with different food items. Today, he wants to make curds out of milk and see how it differs from plain milk. For his experiment he collected three bottles of milk, bottle A, bottle B, and bottle C. Bottle A and bottle B milk are pasteurized, but bottle C milk is just raw milk. He kept the bottle A milk intact, but made curd out of bottle B and bottle C milk.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which milk would be coagulated, bottle A or bottle B?

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose literary style was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent? ?  Poulenc made his début as a composer in 1917 with his Rapsodie nègre, a ten-minute, five-movement piece for baritone and chamber group; it was dedicated to Satie and premiered at one of a series of concerts of new music run by the singer Jane Bathori. There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian boulevard slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the rhapsody. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This jeu d'esprit was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call \\"leg-Poulenc\\". Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot. In completely arbitrary fashion Collet chose the names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, for no other reason than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art ... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being. Cocteau, though similar in age to Les Six, was something of a father-figure to the group. His literary style, \\"paradoxical and lapidary\\" in Hell's phrase, was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent. It greatly appealed to Poulenc, who made his first setting of Cocteau's words in 1919 and his last in 1961. When members of Les Six collaborated with each other, they contributed their own individual sections to the joint work. Their 1920 piano suite L'Album des Six consists of six separate and unrelated pieces....

Article: At dawn on Friday, May 19, 1780, farmers in New England stopped to wonder at the pink color of the sun. By noon the sky had darkened to midnight blackness, causing Americans, still in the painful struggle of a prolonged war of independence, to light candles and tremble at thoughts of the Last Judgment. As the birds quieted and no storm accompanied the darkness, men and women crowded into churches, where one minister commented that \\"The people were very attentive.\\" John Greenleaf Whittier later wrote that \\"Men prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp . . .\\" A recent study of researchers, led by Richard Guyette from the University of Missouri's Tree Ring Laboratory, has shown that vast forest fires in the Algonquin Highlands of southern Ontario and elsewhere in Canada brought this event upon New England. The scientists have discovered \\"fire scars\\" on the rings for that year, left when the heat of a wildfire has killed a part of a tree's cambium  . Evidence collected also points to a drought that year. An easterly wind and low barometric pressure   helped force smoke into the upper atmosphere. \\"The record fits pretty close,\\" says Guyette. \\"We had the right fuel, the drought. The conditions were all there.\\" Lacking the ability to communicate quickly over long distances, Americans in 1780 remained in the dark about the event, which had disappeared by the next day. Over the next several months, the papers carried heated debates about what brought the darkness. Some were the voices of angry prediction, such as one Massachusetts farmer who wrote, \\"Oh! Backsliding New-England, attend now to the things which belong to your peace before they are forever hid from your eyes.\\" Others gave different answers. One stated that a \\"flaming star\\" had passed between the earth and the sun. Ash, argued another commentator.

However, Park Geun-hye, the leader from the South, wanted to be friends with the leader from the North, so she was willing to meet with him and talk about how to make their lands peaceful and bring them together. But, it was not easy, because sometimes the North didn't want to talk. One day, the leader from the North said he might want to meet and talk if everything will be nice and friendly between them. People who told stories on the news, like BBC, thought these words might mean the two leaders could become friendly in the future. Oh, but there was a little problem. Park Geun-hye has a rule to make sure everyone in her land is safe from the North. This rule once sent a person, named Shin Eun-mi, who was born in South Korea but now lived in the United States, back to the United States because she said something nice about the North.

Summarize: For the first part of the process, you will need to scorch the tomatoes at a temperature of 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius). Preheat the oven to that temperature first.  Meanwhile, prepare two baking sheets by lining them with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper. You could also spray the baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray if you do not want to use foil or parchment paper, but note that foil and parchment paper will make it easier for you to clean up later on. Use a rimmed baking sheet so that the excess juices and liquid produced during the process will be contained instead of dripping off into your oven. The tomatoes will need to be washed, dried, cored, and cut. Removing the seeds is an option, as well.  Note that you should not skin the tomatoes yet. Rinse the tomatoes under cool, running water and pat them dry with clean paper towels. Cut a cone shape out of the top stem end of each tomato to remove the core. Use a small paring knife to do so. Cut the tomatoes into decent sizes. Cherry tomatoes should be cut in half, plum or roma tomatoes should be cut into halves or quarters, and larger tomatoes should be cut into 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) slices. You can remove the seeds, if desired, but the seeds and pulp contain a lot of flavor, so many prefer to leave them in. If you decide to remove the seeds, scoop out the seeds with your finger or with a kitchen spoon and leave as much of the pulp behind as possible. Arrange the tomatoes on your prepared baking sheet with the cut-side facing up. Position them so that each piece is about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) apart from the others. Do not stack the tomatoes or let them touch. Doing so could result in tomatoes that do not dehydrate evenly, so some may end up drying out or burning while others remain too moist to use. Popular seasonings for dehydrated tomatoes include salt, ground black pepper, herbs, garlic powder, and onion powder. Sprinkle the tomatoes with your seasoning of choice generously, or according to taste.  If you use herbs, go for options like oregano, parsley, and thyme. Both dried herbs and fresh herbs will work. You could also scatter fresh minced or chopped garlic over the tomatoes instead of using garlic powder. Drizzle a fine stream of olive oil over the tomatoes, coating them evenly.  This oil enhances the flavor of the tomatoes and prevents them from cooking poorly. If using store-bought olive oil in its original container, place your thumb over the spout as you pour so that you can control the speed and size of the stream more easily. Use your hands or tongs to flip the tomatoes over so that the skin-side faces up. This is important since you will be scorching the tomatoes before you dehydrate them fully. By exposing the skin side to the direct heat, you prevent the tomato pulp from becoming too burnt too quickly. Place your tomatoes in the preheated oven and let them sit there for 30 minutes. When ready, the skins will show signs of some wrinkling and some browning. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and pour off the excess liquid that has begun to leak out from the tomatoes. Remove the skins by pinching them in between tongs and peeling them off.  You can drain the liquid by tilting the pan and letting it run off into a bowl, or you could also suction the liquid away using a turkey baster. As soon as you pull the tomatoes out of the oven, you should reduce the temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius). Do not finish roasting the tomatoes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius). Return the tomatoes to the oven and cook for another 3 to 4 hours. The finished tomatoes should look visibly dry with a few dark edges.  Flip the tomato pieces cut-side up after the first hour of cooking. Drain or siphon away the excess juice every 30 minutes. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and let them cool at room temperature. When ready, you can store them in an airtight container or plastic bag, which can be frozen for up to three months. Alternatively, place the tomatoes in a bowl and cove them with extra-virgin olive oil. Wrap the entire bowl in plastic wrap and refrigerate the tomatoes for up to 2 months.","output":"The process of dehydrating tomatoes in the oven involves a few key steps, including preparing the tomatoes, seasoning them, and roasting them at various temperatures. To start, preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius), and prepare two baking sheets with nonstick foil or parchment paper. This helps with cleanup and prevents tomatoes from sticking to the sheet.  After washing, drying, coring, and cutting the tomatoes, you can choose to remove the seeds, although keeping them can retain more flavor. Arrange the tomatoes on the baking sheets, ensuring there is enough space between each piece for even dehydration. Season the tomatoes with a combination of salt, pepper, herbs, and spices, and drizzle olive oil over them.  Next, flip the tomatoes so that the skin side faces up and place them in the preheated oven for 30 minutes to allow them to scorch.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: WHITE HOUSE — \\"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,\\" President Donald Trump vowed Monday amid growing outrage over his administration forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \\"what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.\\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \\"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \\"pawns\\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \\"I say that is a very cowardly response,\\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \\"to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.\\" Trump's Republican party controls both chambers in Congress, and the family border policies were set by his administration.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Robinson Diaz lives in a small cottage high in the Andes Mountains of South America. Diaz is a \\"cable racer\\", and every morning he faces the difficult task of taking the local teacher to her school. To do this, he first walks for an hour up to a place the locals call Los Pinos, right at the edge of the 400-foot deep gorge of the Negro valley. Here, one end of a thick metal cable has been fixed to a wooden post. The cable stretches right across the deep valley to the other side, a kilometer away.  A metal hook is fixed to the cable, with leather straps hanging from it. Diaz fastens the straps around his shoulders and waist, does a quick safety check and then, without hesitating, throws himself off the edge of the mountain. Attached to the cable by only the metal hook, he rapidly picks up speed and soon he is racing through the air. Crossing the valley by wire takes him 30 seconds, instead of the two hours it would take him to walk down through the rain forest and climb up the steep muddy slopes on the other side.  As Diaz begins his trip, Diana Rios, a 23-year-old elementary teacher, is waiting on the other side of the gorge for the moment when he will come racing through the mist towards her at 100 mph. She will then return with him, hanging on to him as he goes back along the cable. Diana had no idea when she took the teaching job that just getting to work in the village school would be dangerous. \\"At first I wanted to cry,\\" she says, clutching her hook as the metal cable starts to rattle violently at Diaz's approach. \\"But I soon got used to it.\\" She still prefers to go with Diaz, though, rather than making the frightening and dangerous crossing on her own.  For the inhabitants of Los Pinos, the wire cable is a lifeline. For more than 50 years, it has served the community as a form of transport to and from the rest of the world. Everything that comes arrives via the cable----bricks and wood for building, sacks of rice and corn. Pregnant mothers, who must get to the nearest clinic, cross the wire during the darkness of the night, returning with their newborn babies. It is dangerous, but they have no choice.  This time Robinson Diaz makes a perfect landing on Diana's side of the gorge. For him, the dangers of this daily journey are insignificant. \\"What I'm really scared of are snakes,\\" he says. \\"This is nothing in comparison.\\" Then Dianna straps herself into her harness and hooks herself up to the wire behind Diaz, holding on to him tightly. He turns, flashes her a smile, releases the brake and kicks away. Within seconds, the teacher and the cable-racer have disappeared back into the mist.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: soleus strain. With a more serious strain, it's important to distinguish which muscle is involved to the greater extent: the deeper soleus or the more superficial \\"heads\\" of the gastrocnemius. MRI or diagnostic ultrasound may be needed to best diagnose the location and degree of the injury. Grade II strains involve more extensive damage, up to 90% of the muscle fibers may be torn. These injuries present with more pain (described as sharp in nature), significant loss of muscle strength and range of motion. Swelling is more severe and bruising quickly develops because of the internal bleeding from the torn muscle fibers.  With Grade II strains, there's limited ability to perform activities, especially jumping and running, so you'll be sidelined for a while (a few weeks or more). The gastrocnemius muscle is considered at high risk for strains because it crosses two joints (knee and ankle) and has a high proportion of type-2 fast twitch muscle fibers  The medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle is strained more often than the lateral head. treatment protocol. This protocol is still appropriate for Grade II strains, although you may have to keep the ice on your calf for a little longer (up to 20 minutes at a time) if the deeper soleus muscle is the primary site of injury. Instead of using R.I.C.E for a few days as is the case with a mild strain, more severe strains will likely require attention for a week or more.  Most Grade II lower leg strains cause significant discomfort for between one to two weeks post injury, depending on proportion of muscle fibers involved and the type of treatment sought. These types of muscle injuries may require one to two months before a complete return to athletics occurs.  For moderate to severe muscle strains, the use of anti-inflammatories should be restricted in the first 24 – 72 hours due to increased risk of bleeding from the anti-platelet (blood thinning) effect. A Grade II strain is a relatively serious musculoskeletal injury that most likely involves significant scar tissue formation, as well as noticeably reduced range of motion and strength. As such, after the swelling, bruising and pain have mostly subsided, ask your doctor for a referral to a sports medicine specialist or physiotherapist who can offer a variety of tailored strengthening exercises, stretches, massage techniques and therapies such as therapeutic ultrasound (to reduce inflammation and break down scar tissue adhesions) and electronic muscle stimulation (to strengthen muscle fibers and promote blood flow).  Return to full activity is usually allowed when you're pain free, have full range of motion of your lower leg and full strength of your calf muscles, which may take a few weeks or more.  Calf strains are most common in men between the ages of 30 and 50 years.

With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the two names of the large 18-century star fort built by the French in norther New York?  Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the  Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack.  Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...

The leader of the force, a radical Russian named Radchenko (Daniel von Bargen), threatens to launch the missiles he has seized. Radchenko's forces, about 60,000 strong, have also gained control of three Akula-class attack submarines to protect the shores off Vladivostok.The United States summons the officers and crew of the nuclear submarine Alabama, which is being dispatched to patrol the coast of eastern Russia. If necessary, the Alabama will be available to launch nuclear missiles to stop Radchenko's forces before they can launch their hijacked missiles.Commander Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) of the US Navy is called into an interview with the Alabama's CO, Captain Ramsey (Gene Hackman). The Alabama's executive officer (XO) is ill and a replacement is needed. Ramsey is impressed with Hunter's service record and the two connect over horse riding. Ramsey's Jack Russell Terrier also seems to approve of Hunter.The situation in Vladivostok escalates and Hunter and his friend, Lt. \\"Weps\\" Ince (Viggo Mortensen), are called up for duty and leave immediately for the Alabama. Ramsey gives a stirring send-off speech and the boat puts to sea.

Ramsey is eager to know Hunter's views on the subject, especially since the XO has a degree in philosophy. Hunter states the the true nature of war is to serve itself and leave the world destroyed. Ramsey takes the opinion seriously although he seems to disagree with his XO.On patrol off the eastern coast of Russia, the Alabama runs drills.

When the god Zeus (Laurence Olivier) impregnates her, Acrisius sends his daughter and his newborn grandson Perseus to sea in a wooden chest. In retribution, Zeus kills Acrisius and orders Poseidon (Jack Gwillim) to release the last of the Titans, a gigantic sea creature called the Kraken, to destroy Argos. Meanwhile, DanaÃ« and Perseus safely float to the island of Seriphos, where Perseus grows to adulthood. Calibos (Neil McCarthy), son of the sea goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith), is a young man engaged to marry Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker), the daughter of Queen Cassiopeia (SiÃ¢n Phillips) and heir to the rich city of Joppa; but for committing several atrocities against Zeus, including hunting and destroying Zeus's sacred flying horses (excepting only Pegasus), Zeus transforms Calibos into a monstrous satyr and he is exiled by his people. In revenge, Thetis transports an adult Perseus (Harry Hamlin) from Seriphos to an abandoned amphitheatre in Joppa, where he is befriended by an elderly poet named Ammon (Burgess Meredith) and learns that Andromeda is under a curse and cannot marry unless her suitor successfully answers a riddle, whose failures are burned at the stake. In order to aid his son, Zeus sends Perseus a god-crafted helmet from Athena (Susan Fleetwood) which makes its wearer invisible, a magical sword from Aphrodite (Ursula Andress), and a shield from Hera (Claire Bloom). Perseus, wearing the helmet, captures Pegasus and follows Andromeda to learn the next riddle. Perseus is nearly killed by Calibos but manages to sever one of Calibos' hands, losing his helmet in the process. Perseus befriends Thallo (Tim Pigott-Smith) and presents himself as suitor and correctly answers the riddle, presenting the severed hand of Calibos. Perseus wins Andromeda's hand in marriage.

Summarize this article: A birthday party at a house rented through accommodation website Airbnb was cut short when the guests discovered a decomposing corpse in the garden of the property.      The group of friends made the discovery on Saturday afternoon. The body was lying face-down in a hole at the edge of the garden, partially covered by trees.      They had rented the house in Palaiseau, ten miles south of Paris, for a weekend getaway to celebrate a 25th birthday. The seven-bedroom home was described in its Airbnb listing as a renovated 19th-century building with a swimming pool and a \\"lovely forest with a jogging trail\\" at the rear. It was at the edge of this woodland that they discovered the corpse, said to be in an advanced state of decomposition. The listing has now been removed from the website.      Police say the body is that of a woman aged between 30 and 50, clothed but with bare feet, and that the corpse could have been in the garden for several weeks. A source told Le Parisien that investigators suspect foul play.      Airbnb has come under fire previously for its marketplace model, which allows holidaymakers and property owners to bypass the traditional booking model. Critics say it allows renters to essentially operate as a business while skirting the insurance requirements and health and safety rules imposed on licensed hotels, leaving both owners and guests vulnerable.      Last year, the family of a man killed when a rope swing broke at an Airbnb rental property in Texas tried to raise awareness about the lack of inspections to ensure listed properties meet safety regulations or fire codes.      An Airbnb spokesman told the Huffington Post that hosts were expected to follow local rules and regulations and that the company issues a long list of advisory safety precautions. \\"Nothing is more important to us than safety,\\" he said. ||||| PARIS (AP) — French authorities are investigating the death of a woman whose decomposing body was found in the garden of an Airbnb rental in suburban Paris.      Bertrand Daillie, the deputy prosecutor for Evry, said a group of young people who were renting the house for a weekend discovered the badly decomposed body in the garden near the edge of the property. He says it was covered by tree branches that had been placed there deliberately.      Daillie told France Bleu radio the renters were to be questioned but had only rented the house for that weekend. According to Le Parisien newspaper, the listing was removed Sunday from Airbnb. ||||| A group of friends who rented a house via Airbnb in the Paris suburbs to hold a weekend party had their plans brought to a macabre end when they found the decomposing body of a woman in the garden.      The friends found the corpse on Saturday afternoon at the bottom of a steep bank at the end of the garden in the three-storey premises in the southern suburb of Palaiseau, 10 miles south of Paris.      The body was curled up, face down, in a shallow grave and had been covered with branches and logs, police said, adding that the victim was dressed but had no shoes on.      Police said they were treating the woman’s death as murder.      She had no identity papers on her and on Sunday, officers were still trying to find out who she was.      “The state of the body, which was in an advanced stage of decomposition, did not enable investigators to determine the cause of death,” a judicial source said. A post mortem was due to be carried out.      The prosecutor’s office in the nearby suburb of Evry said that “all the signs suggest that this was a criminal act.”      The group who rented the house for the weekend using the online rental website were due to be questioned by police on Sunday. They cancelled plans for their Saturday night party after finding the corpse.      There was no immediate information available on who owned the premises. Airbnb did not reply to a query by the Telegraph as to whether the advert for the house would be maintained on its website.      Airbnb has grown at breakneck speed since it was launched in San Francisco in 2008, and now claims more than 60 million users worldwide.      It has also seen a number of scandals involving theft, property damage and a range of sordid activities in hosts’ apartments.      The French capital last year emerged as the world’s biggest home-sharing city, with more than 40,000 active listings on Airbnb, putting it ahead of both New York and London.      The company paid nearly €1.2 million (£950,000) to Paris city authorities in the last quarter of 2015.      It reached an agreement with the city last year and since October has charged users a tourist tax of 83 cents per night, which it then passes on to the town hall. |||||","output":"A birthday party at a house rented via Airbnb near Paris was cut short when the guests discovered a decomposing corpse in the garden of the property.

His employer had a large private library so Owen was able to educate himself. He read a lot in his spare time and at nineteen he was given the job of superintendent  at a Manchester cotton mill. He was so successful there that he persuaded his employer to buy the New Lanark mill in Scotland. When he arrived at New Lanark it was a dirty little town with a population of 2,000 people. Nobody paid any attention to the workers' houses or their children's education. The conditions in the factories were very bad. There was a lot of crime and the men spent most of their wages on alcoholic drinks. Owen improved the houses. He encouraged people to be clean and save money. He opened a shop and sold the workers cheap, well-made goods to help them. He limited the sale of alcoholic drinks. Above all, he fixed his mind on the children's education. In 1816 he opened the first free primary school in Britain. People came from all over the country to visit Owen's factory. They saw that the workers were healthier and more efficient than in other towns. Their children were better fed and better educated. Owen tried the same experiment in the United States. He bought some land there in 1825, but the community was too far away. He could not keep it under control and lost most of his money. Owen never stopped fighting for his idea. Above all he believed that people are not born good or bad.

Yahoo announced its own new browser Wednesday evening: Axis.      Working seamlessly between your iPhone, iPad and computer Yahoo is aiming to streamline your searches and connect your experience across devices by giving you access to the same information no matter what device you're accessing it on.      Visual previews of sites in Axis eliminate the traditional step in web searches where you're looking through links and replaces that experience with an image of the website you'll be going to. Some searches can even be done without leaving the page you're on.      iOS      Tapping the Axis Bar -– which combines the search box and address bar into one -– will bring up a list of trending searches. You can tap a particular trending search to learn more, or enter your own search term or website address into the bar.      Answers will begin to appear automatically for common searches like movie times and weather, often allowing you to see what you're looking for without having to leave the page you're on.      For other searches the browser will create a row of visual previews to websites matching your specific query. You can swipe through the results, and then tap on a picture to visit a specific page. If you don't like the result you've selected you can swipe across the screen to check out the next search result.      An Axis homepage gives you access to the sites you've recently visited not only on your iOS device, but also on your home computer or any other device you might use running Axis. So, the homepage on your iPad will show a website you visit frequently on your iPhone, or one you check out often while browsing at home.      Searches can also be continued from one device to another. For instance, a “Continue from iPhone” button will appear on your iPad and allow you to continue viewing search results you were looking at one your phone on a bigger screen.      On your computer      On your computer Axis is a plug-in for your favorite web browser rather than a stand-alone product of its own. Available for Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari, the Axis toolbar shows up at the bottom of your web browser and can be used much like the iOS version to see visual previews of sites, and to look up information without leaving the page you're on.      The homepage option is also available within your browser, letting you to look at favorite websites and continue viewing search results from your iPhone or iPad.      Axis is available now. What do you think of the web browser. Can you see yourself using it? let us know in the comments. ||||| Axis replaces the standard search results page with a horizontal, scrollable list of thumbnails. iPad version shown. (Credit: Screenshot by Rafe Needleman/CNET)      Yahoo is announcing tonight that it's getting into the browser business with its new Axis browser. There are versions for iPad and iPhone, and plug-ins for the desktop browsers Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari.      The design goal, according to Ethan Batraski, head of product for the Search Innovation Group at Yahoo, is to eliminate the middle step in the usual Web search process: Enter a query, see the results, go to a page. With Axis, you're supposed to be able to go directly from query to page, skipping the step of surfing a sea of links.      The implication that Axis entirely bypasses the need to pick from search results is false, but Axis does nonetheless have a much better way of getting you from searching to visiting a Web page. The browser works well. This is an aggressive product for the struggling Yahoo to launch out of its search group.      Yahoo gets visual with Web browsing      Here's why: Yahoo, which still generates more than a billion dollars a year in revenue from its search division, makes a lot of that money from that second step in the search process. It runs ads on search result pages.      On Axis, there are no search result pages.      Instead, what you get when you search, at least 80 percent of the time, Batraski says, is a horizontal display of Web page thumbnails. (The other 20 percent of the time you get text boxes with results in them.) It's easy to see if one of the pages is what you're looking for, and then you can go there directly. To see the tiles again and go to other results, you just pull down the page from the top. To move forward or backward in the list of results directly from a page you're on, you drag your finger from the right or left. bypassing the results list entirely.      So, to be clear, there actually is a list of search results. It just looks a lot better because it's integrated into the browser. Ads will get inserted into the list of search tiles eventually, assuming the product is a success with users. But for the time being, the more successful Axis is, the more it will drive Yahoo traffic away from search revenues -- which only this last quarter began to recover after years of sliding.      The iPhone version's interface is a little hemmed-in, but still very usable. (Credit: Screenshot by Rafe Needleman/CNET)      As a tactic for launching the browser, focusing on the user experience above all and forgoing search revenues is probably very wise, since it may be difficult for the browser to make a dent in the market. I asked Batraski about other alterna-browsers that struggled to win major market share, and mostly failed: Flock, Rockmelt, Opera, AT&T's Pogo, and others. Why does Yahoo think it can pull a Chrome with its product?      Distribution, says Batraski. There are 700 million people using Yahoo, and they can all be marketed to. Also, Yahoo distributes browsers (mostly IE with the Yahoo embedded toolbar) to 80 million people a year. The company knows how to get browsers out there, at least on desktop operating systems. But Axis on the desktop is actually not its own browser, but rather a plug-in that works with the browser a user already has. If you use the plug-in's URL and search box in the lower-left of your browser, you'll get Yahoo's results. If you forget it's there and use the browser's standard URL/search box, you get whatever you've already been getting.      One gets the feeling that the desktop versions of Axis exist primarily as accessories to the mobile versions, so users can move between platforms and keep their open tabs and histories intact. When you're logged in, Axis knows what you do on each device and makes it easy to pick up on one where you left off on another.      Mobile is where the action is, so it makes sense that Yahoo threw the bulk of its development love into the tablet and smartphone versions. On the iPad, Axis is simply a great browser. The integrated search feature is intuitive, and being able to move through search results without having to go back to search makes sense. After only a few minutes using it I thought, Why hasn't Google done this yet? It's that good.      Although mobile devices like the iPad come with embedded browsers, Batraski says the product has Apple's blessing. He also said that Apple reps have told him they're not throwing many resources into Apple's own iOS browser, Safari. Axis takes the best that Safari has to offer -- its core rendering engine, Webkit -- and really does make it better. But no matter what Apple says, it's not yet fully behind alternative browsers like Axis: On iOS, you can't change your default browser (unless you jailbreak your device). Click a link in an e-mail message or another app, and your device will open it up in Safari, no matter how in love with Axis you are.      Batraski is convinced this will change eventually, and that if it doesn't, Apple will have a Microsoft-scale antitrust issue on its hands.      What about Android? The Android version of Axis is still in development, and while it's much easier for a user to get an alternative browser installed and embedded in an Android product, it's a pretty safe bet that Google isn't exactly going to roll out the welcome mat for Yahoo's browser. Google already has two of its own browsers for mobile, the Android browser and the still-in-beta Android version of Chrome. And those drive traffic to Google's ads, not Yahoo's. (Firefox, by the way, defaults to using Google for search, so even when people use it instead of Chrome, Google still wins.)      The Axis browser may not conquer the world, but it is a very strong mobile product with an important new design concept for search. It's also a gutsy business move from Yahoo. It's rather refreshing. |||||","output":"Yahoo has announced its new browser Axis, in an attempt to streamline searches and connect user experience across devices. Axis offers visual previews of sites, replacing the time-consuming process of sifting through search result links with images of the websites users are searching for. Some searches can even be executed without leaving the current webpage. The Axis Bar, which combines the search box and address bar into a single entity, displays a list of trending searches that users can either select to learn more or enter their own search term or website address. The browser creates a row of visual previews related to the specific search query, allowing users to swipe through results and tap an image to visit a webpage. Searches can be continued from one device to another, such as continuing to view search results from an iPhone on an iPad by using a \\"Continue from iPhone\\" button.

Information:  - Military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in armed forces, police, intelligence agencies or other institutions organized along military lines. Usually, uniforms denote the bearer's rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms. Ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations, in particular with regards to logistics, command, and coordination; as time continued and military operations became larger and more complex, military ranks increased and ranking systems themselves became more complex.  - Commander (French: \\"Commandeur\\") is a common naval and air force officer rank. Commander is also used as a rank or title in other formal organisations, including several police forces.   - Commander John Wallace Linton VC , DSO , DSC ( 15 October 1905 -- 23 March 1943 ) was a Royal Navy submariner and a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces . His nickname was \`\` Tubby '' and he was a fine Rugby football forward .  - The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest award of the United Kingdom honours system. It is awarded for gallantry \\"in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819  22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India.  - Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

Please answer the following question: The 1990 United States elections occurred in the middle of the presidential term of an American politician who was father to what man who was the 43rd president of the United States? Answer:","output":"The 1990 United States elections occurred during the middle of the presidential term of George H. W. Bush, who was the 41st President of the United States. He served from 1989 to 1993. George H. W. Bush was the father of George W. Bush, the man who later became the 43rd President of the United States, serving from 2001 to 2009. George H. W. Bush, born on June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, was a prominent figure in American politics before becoming president. He served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas, Ambassador to the United Nations, Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in China, and later as the Director of Central Intelligence. Additionally, he served two terms as Vice President under President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1989. His son, George W. Bush, was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut. Similar to his father, he engaged in a range of professional pursuits before entering the political arena. He worked in the oil industry and owned the Texas Rangers baseball team. George W. Bush's political career began when he was elected as the 46th Governor of Texas, holding office from 1995 to 2000. Following in his father's footsteps, George W. Bush ran for the presidency and won the 2000 election, with a controversial victory over Democratic candidate Al Gore. He was re-elected in 2004, defeating Democratic challenger John Kerry. The George W. Bush presidency was marked by significant events such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the launching of the War on Terror in response, and the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The 1990 United States elections, which took place during George H. W. Bush's presidency, were held on November 6, 1990. These midterm elections consisted of 35 U.S. Senate seats, all 435 U.S. House of Representative seats, and 36 gubernatorial races. During these elections, the Democratic Party maintained control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, while making minimal gains. The election results showcased the varying public opinion on the sitting president's administration, with concerns about the national economy and the federal budget deficit being significant topics during the campaigns. In conclusion, the 1990 United States elections occurred during the presidency of George H. W. Bush, and his son, George W. Bush, was the man who would later become the 43rd President of the United States. This father-son connection marks a unique historical and familial legacy in American politics, as only one other father-son duo, John Adams and John Quincy Adams, have held the U.S. presidency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Consequently, Weinreich gives the definition \\"A person's identity is defined as the totality of one's self-construal, in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future\\"; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as: \\"One's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity\\" (Weinreich, 1986a).  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"Self-image, self-esteem, and individuality relate to an individual's overall sense of identity and how they perceive and value themselves in different aspects of their life. These aspects are interconnected and can highly influence an individual's psychological well-being, their relationships with others, and their behavior in various situations. Self-image refers to the mental representation an individual has of themselves, which is shaped by personal experiences, beliefs, and societal influences. This involves both internal and external perceptions such as one's perceived abilities, traits, physical appearance, and social roles. Self-image is dynamic and can evolve over time as one's experiences and interactions with others change. Self-esteem, on the other hand, is the evaluative component of an individual's self-concept. It reflects the value and worth that a person attributes to themselves. Self-esteem can be influenced by factors such as personal achievements, social comparison, and the feedback and appraisals we receive from others. A healthy self-esteem is crucial for psychological well-being as it helps people cope with challenges and setbacks, maintain resilience, and engage in positive relationships. Individuality encompasses the unique features that distinguish a person from others, thus shaping one's identity. These features can include personal values, beliefs, interests, preferences, and goals. Acknowledging and embracing one's individuality enables a person to develop a strong sense of self and is essential for cultivating a positive self-concept and self-esteem. These elements of self-image, self-esteem, and individuality are deeply intertwined and contribute to the formation of one's identity, as described by Weinreich's definition of identity as the totality of one's self-construal. Collectively, they are essential in understanding human behavior, interpersonal relationships, and personal development. How a person construes themselves can impact their motivation, aspirations, and ultimately, their future choices and experiences. Therefore, nurturing a positive self-image, maintaining healthy self-esteem, and appreciating individuality are fundamental aspects of promoting psychological well-being and personal growth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The premise clearly states that the speaker has memories of their mother preparing large Thanksgiving dinners, which contradicts the hypothesis. In the premise, the speaker emphasizes their reminiscing using phrases like \\"oh yeah\\" and \\"yeah,\\" suggesting that the memories are positive and vivid. The speaker explicitly mentions remembering \\"big Thanksgiving dinners\\" that their mother used to make. These fond recollections involve the mother being actively involved in making the Thanksgiving meals, contributing to the warmth and familial nature associated with this holiday. Therefore, the hypothesis that the mother never made Thanksgiving dinner is not aligned with the provided information from the premise. Instead, the truth value of the statement is negated by the evidence within the premise, which directly points to the mother's role in creating the memorable Thanksgiving feasts. To recap, the hypothesis \\"My mother never made Thanksgiving dinner\\" is false based on the premise provided. The premise illustrates the strong connection between the speaker's memories of their mother and her role in preparing extravagant Thanksgiving meals, contradicting the hypothesis.

Which vegetable is present in dishes cooked ‘a la Crecy’????","output":"A la Crecy, or Crécy-style, refers to a French culinary term used to describe dishes that predominantly feature carrots as the main vegetable ingredient. These dishes are named after Crécy-en-Ponthieu, a town in the Picardy region of northern France, traditionally known for its high-quality, sweet, and tender carrots. To create a traditional Crécy-style dish, carrots play a crucial role in the flavor profile, as well as the presentation and texture of the dish. In dishes cooked 'a la Crécy,' carrots are often prepared multiple ways, either cooked slowly until they are tender or pureed with butter and cream. They might be diced, sliced, or julienned into thin ribbons, depending on the desired texture. Additionally, carrots may even be glazed with sugar to bring out their natural sweetness. A variety of dishes can be prepared 'a la Crécy.' Some examples include: 1. Potage Crécy: This is a classic French carrot soup, typically made by sautéing finely chopped onions and carrots in butter until tender. They are then simmered in a vegetable or chicken stock, pureed to a smooth consistency, and seasoned with herbs and spices. The soup is often finished with a touch of cream for richness. 2. Boeuf à la Crécy: This beef and carrot stew includes braised beef, carrots, onions, and a rich tomato sauce. It is cooked slowly for hours to develop deep flavors and create tender meat and vegetables. 3. Carottes Vichy: A popular French side dish, these carrots are cooked in Vichy water, which is a mineral-rich carbonated water from the Vichy region of France. The carrots are cooked until tender and glazed in the pan with sugar and butter. 4. Poulet à la Crécy: For this dish, chicken is cooked with carrots and other vegetables, such as onions and leeks, and seasoned with aromatic herbs like thyme, parsley, and bay leaf. The dish becomes even more delicious as the chicken's natural juices meld with the carrots and other vegetables. 5. Flan de Crécy: This is a stunning carrot flan, made by combining pureed carrots, eggs, cream, and seasonings, then baked in a water bath until set. It is served as a side dish or light lunch, often accompanied by a green salad. In summary, dishes cooked 'a la Crécy' feature carrots as the primary vegetable ingredient, and they're named after the town of Crécy-en-Ponthieu in France. The town is known for producing high-quality, tender, and sweet carrots, which are used to create delicious and flavorful Crécy-style dishes. French culinary traditions feature various forms of carrot preparations, from soups and stews to side dishes and flans, which highlights the versatility of the primary ingredient and its importance in French cuisine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood. Considering the unimaginative cuisine of my youth, it's surprising that I eat anything at all.

It was released on October 10, 1995, by Trauma Records and Interscope Records. It was the final album to feature original keyboardist Eric Stefani, who left the band in 1994. The album was produced by Matthew Wilder and recorded in 11 studios in the Greater Los Angeles Area between March 1993 and October 1995. Between 1995 and 1998, seven singles were released from it, including \\"Just a Girl\\", which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart; and \\"Don't Speak\\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay and reached the top five of many international charts. The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, No Doubt earned nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. It has sold over 16 million copies worldwide, and was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States and Canada, platinum in the United Kingdom, and triple platinum in Australia. Tragic Kingdom helped to initiate the ska revival of the 1990s, persuading record labels to sign more ska bands and helping them to attract more mainstream attention. The album was ranked number 441 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. No Doubt embarked on a tour to promote the album.

Article: With the development of society and economy, animals and their habitats are getting pushed aside as households decrease in size and increase in number. Small numbers of people per household on average use more energy and goods per person. Greater numbers of households require more natural resources for construction. The possible result of this problem may be _ natural resources to meet consumer demand without endangering habitats important to biodiversity. Personal freedom and social choice may come at huge environmental cost. Direct costs include visible damage to animal habitats and plant life. Indirect costs include the release of more greenhouse gases. The effects of such \\"personal freedom and social choice\\" have already surfaced in south-west China's Wolong Nature Reserve. In Wolong, they found that a reduced average household size was directly tied to an increase in homes, and thus an increase in the amount of firewood consumed for cooking and heating. The rise in wood fuel use has contributed to disappearance of forests and to the loss of habitats for giant pandas. Curious about whether other parts of the world were experiencing similar phenomena, they got the support of a team of researchers including Stanford's Paul Ehrlich, well-known for his population studies, to find out the household dynamics in 141 countries between 1985 and 2000. Their study proved that the difficult choice of Wolong is part of a global trend. In the 76 countries considered biodiversity \\"hotspots\\", such as the United States, Brazil, Australia, and Kenya, the number of households grew by 3.1% every year, while the population increased just 1.8%. Meanwhile, the number of people per home dropped from 4.7 to 4.0. The decline in household size has resulted in 155 million additional households in hotspot countries, almost always limiting biodiversity. In the 10 non-hotspot countries -- those without high-density areas of animal and plant species -- similar results were found, though on a lesser scale. Even in countries experiencing...

Context: The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America\\" and in his diary recorded: \\"Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine\\". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\".

QB Kurt Warner drew first blood against his former team, as completed a 12-yard TD strike to WR Larry Fitzgerald for the only score of the first quarter.  However, in the second quarter, it was all St. Louis. Kicker Jeff Wilkins got a 26-yard field goal, QB Marc Bulger completed a 9-yard pass to WR Torry Holt, and Wilkens got a 47-yard field goal as time ran out on the first half.  In the third quarter, Wilkens helped the Rams increase their lead with a 21-yard field, which would be the only score of the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter, even a valiant effort for a comeback, the only score that Arizona could muster was a 6-yard TD run by RB Edgerrin James.  After a Bulger fumble deep in St. Louis territory while trying to run out the clock set up the Cardinals for an easy chip shot field goal to win, Warner fumbled a snap and St. Louis recovered to seal the victory. Adding to the fact that Warner had 3 interceptions during the game, the Cardinals would get their very first loss in their new stadium as they fell to 1-2.

However, we can consider a few scenarios based on the context provided and the possible answers given. It is important to note that the question talks about Carson and not Cameron, so we need to make certain assumptions based on this. 1. If we assume that Cameron and Carson are classmates or friends, and Cameron also took the same test:  Scenario 1: Cameron, similar to Carson, had a good night's rest before the test and performed well. In this scenario, Cameron would likely feel happy about their grade. Both Carson and Cameron's success can be attributed to their effective preparation and rest before the test, resulting in higher test scores. This outcome would lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Scenario 2: Cameron did not have a good night's rest before the test and/or did not perform well. In this scenario, Cameron might feel sad about their performance or mad at their grade. Seeing Carson's success and comparing it to their own test results could make Cameron regret not taking proper rest or better preparing for the test. They might recognize that inadequate rest and preparation negatively impacted their performance and led to an undesirable outcome. 2. If we assume Cameron and Carson have no direct relationship and Cameron did not take the same test: In this case, as there is no relevant context to assess Cameron's emotions, it would be challenging to predict how they would feel after the test. Their feelings would likely depend on the test they took, their individual performance, and any existing personal factors that could influence their emotions.

Shuja Khanzada's death was a massive setback to Pakistan's progress in combating militancy and extremism since he was the highest-ranking Pakistani political figure to be slain by militants that year. BBC correspondent, Shahzeb Jillani, reports that Khanzada's death raised questions regarding the security measures in place around the home minister, who had allegedly reported threats against him. The lethal attack occurred during a meeting between Khanzada and his supporters in his hometown of Attock. There was a massive explosion resulting from a large bomb, causing the roof to collapse and trapping numerous individuals under the debris. Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif led the tributes to the fallen minister, emphasizing the bravery and determination of Shuja Khanzada as he confronted the forces of terrorism. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, the extremist group behind the attack, has been responsible for some of the bloodiest assaults in recent years. Despite being banned in Pakistan in 2001 and designated a terrorist organization by the United States in 2003, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi continues to perpetrate violence across the country, claiming responsibility for hundreds of deaths, primarily targeting the Shia Muslim community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - Buckshot LeFonque was a musical group project of Branford Marsalis. The name Buckshot LeFonque was a pseudonym used by jazz saxophonist Julian \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley for contractual reasons on the album \\"Here Comes Louis Smith\\" (1958). After playing with Sting, Miles Davis and other artists, Marsalis founded this band to create a new sound by merging classic jazz with rock, pop, R&B and hip-hop influences.  - Ronald Lawrence Albert Simpson , known as Ronny Jordan ( 29 November 1962 -- 13 January 2014 ) was a British guitarist at the forefront of the acid jazz movement at the end of the twentieth century . Jordan described his music as \`\` urban jazz , '' a blend of jazz , hip - hop , and R&B .  - Acid jazz, also known as club jazz, is a musical genre that combines elements of jazz, soul, funk and disco. Acid jazz originated in the London club scene of the mid-1980s in the rare groove movement and spread to the US, Japan, Eastern Europe and Brazil. Major acts included Brand New Heavies, Incognito, Us3 and Jamiroquai from the UK and Buckshot LeFonque and Digable Planets from the US. The rise of electronic club music in the mid to late 1990s led to a decline in interest, and in the twenty-first century, the movement became indistinct as a genre. Many acts that might have been defined as acid jazz are now seen as jazz-funk, neo soul or jazz rap.  - Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.  - Jazz rap is a fusion subgenre of hip hop music and jazz, developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. AllMusic writes that the genre \\"was an attempt to fuse African-American music of the past with a newly dominant form of the present, paying tribute to and reinvigorating the former while expanding the horizons of the latter\\". Musically, the rhythms have been typically those of hip hop rather than jazz, over which are placed repetitive phrases of jazz instrumentation: trumpet, double bass, etc. Lyrics are often based on political consciousness, Afrocentrism, and general positivism. A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Dream Warriors, and Digable Planets are pioneers of the jazz rap genre.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica.  - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.  - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.  - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The New Orleans metropolitan area (New OrleansMetairieKenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of 1,167,764 in 2010 and was the 46th largest in the United States. The New OrleansMetairieBogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502.  - The classical guitar (also known as concert guitar, classical acoustic, nylon-string guitar, or Spanish guitar) is the member of the guitar family used in classical music. It is an acoustical wooden guitar with strings made of nylon, rather than the metal strings used in acoustic and electric guitars. The traditional classical guitar has twelve frets clear of the body and is held on the left leg, so that the hand that plucks or strums the strings does so near the back of the soundhole (this is called the classical position). The modern steel string guitar, on the other hand, usually has fourteen frets clear of the body (see Dreadnought) and is commonly played off the hip.  - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.  - Jazz-funk is a subgenre of jazz music characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds and an early prevalence of analog synthesizers. The integration of funk, soul, and R&B music and styles into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is quite wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs, and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.  - An acoustic guitar is a guitar that produces sound acousticallyby transmitting the vibration of the strings to the airas opposed to relying on electronic amplification (see electric guitar). The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the guitar's body, creating sound. This typically involves the use of a sound board and a sound box to strengthen the vibrations of the strings.  - A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \\"musical form\\" and \\"musical style\\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated.  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - Polyrhythm is the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms, that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter. The rhythmic conflict may be the basis of an entire piece of music (cross-rhythm), or a momentary disruption. Polyrhythms can be distinguished from irrational rhythms, which can occur within the context of a single part; polyrhythms require at least two rhythms to be played concurrently, one of which is typically an irrational rhythm.  - Neo soul is a genre of popular music. The term was coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop, fusion, and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - Digable Planets is an American alternative hip hop trio formed in 1992, in Brooklyn, New York. The trio is composed of rappers Ishmael \\"Butterfly\\" Butler (from Seattle), Mary Ann \\"Ladybug Mecca\\" Vieira (from Silver Spring, Maryland), and Craig \\"Doodlebug\\" Irving (from Philadelphia).  - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - Rare groove is soul or jazz music that is very hard to source or relatively obscure. Rare groove is primarily associated with funk, jazz and pop, but is also connected to subgenres including jazz fusion, Latin jazz, soul, R&B, northern soul, and disco. Vinyl records that fall into this category generally have high re-sale prices. Rare groove records have been sought after by not only collectors and lovers of this type of music, but also by hip-hop artists and producers. Online music retailers sell a wide selection of rare groove at more affordable prices, offering fast downloads in digital format. This availability and ease of access has brought about a resurgence of the genre in recent years.  - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War.  - Jamiroquai are a British funk and acid jazz band formed in 1992. Fronted by lead singer Jay Kay, Jamiroquai were initially the most prominent component in the London-based funk/acid jazz movement, alongside groups such as Incognito, the James Taylor Quartet, and the Brand New Heavies. Subsequent albums have explored other musical directions such as pop, rock, and electronica.  - Us3 is a jazz-rap group founded in London in 1992. Their name was inspired by a Horace Parlan recording produced by Alfred Lion, the founder of Blue Note Records. On their debut album, \\"Hand on the Torch\\", Us3 exclusively used samples from the Blue Note Records catalogue, all originally produced by Lion.  - The Brand New Heavies are an acid jazz and funk group formed in 1985 in Ealing in west London.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Improvisation is broad term referring to the process of devising an atypical method of solving a problem due to lack of time or resources. In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines.  - The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: With the growth of the European Union and increased globalisation, English is increasingly the lingua franc a  in European businesses, and those who speak it have become the elite  of the workforce. In the past, only a few specialists in a company were needed to communicate with foreign businesses.However, in these days of multinational companies, where workers are required to communicate with other employees from several countries, a common language is essential and English has become the logical choice. Nowadays, even blue-collar workers in many companies are required to speak English.For example, just over three years ago, a Dutch company.United Pan-European Communications (UPC), was contracted to build a TV studio in Amsterdam.The job involved many electricians--more than the company could find in the Netherlands.There were plenty of qualified electricians in nearby France and Belgium, but the American and Dutch executives of UPC wanted everyone on the job to speak and understand the same language.So, the UPC hired British electricians and flew them to Amsterdam every Monday, accommodating them in hotels all over the city, and flying them home on Friday evenings. Increasingly, workers who can speak English earn salaries 25-35% higher than those who can' t.They are also eligible   for a wider range of high-level jobs. The problem is that, while the ability to speak English is fast becoming essential for getting a good job, there is a shortage of people who can speak it.According to a recent European Commission report, only about 41% of continental Europeans can speak English, and only 29% speak it well enough to carry on a conversation.Many companies are solving this problem by setting up English language schools within the workplace.English language schools all over Europe are expanding at a huge rate, and governments are looking at ways to improve English tuition in schools. One result of this modem urge to learn English is that a generation gap is appearing. According to a European Union study, 67% of...

Information:  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The protected cruiser is a type of naval cruiser of the late 19th century, so known because its armoured deck offered protection for vital machine spaces from fragments caused by exploding shells above. Protected cruisers were an alternative to the armoured cruisers, which also had a belt of armour along the sides.  - A warship is a naval ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare. Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state. As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships. Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo, a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew. Warships usually belong to a navy, though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations.  - A battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a capital ship built in the first half of the 20th century. They were similar in size, cost, and armament to battleships, but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships.  - The capital ships of a navy are its most important warships; they are generally the larger ships when compared to other warships in their respective fleet. A capital ship is generally a leading or a primary ship in a naval fleet.  - Pre-dreadnought battleships were sea-going battleships built between the mid- to late 1880s and 1905, before the launch of . Pre-dreadnoughts replaced the ironclad battleships of the 1870s and 1880s. Built from steel, and protected by hardened steel armour, pre-dreadnought battleships carried a main battery of very heavy guns in barbettes (open or with armored gunhouses) supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons. They were powered by coal-fuelled triple-expansion steam engines.  - The armored cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered. Varying in size, it was distinguished from other types of cruiser by its belt armorthick iron (or later steel) plating on much of the hull to protect the ship from shellfire much like that on battleships. The first armored cruiser, the Imperial Russian Navy's , was launched in 1873 and combined sail and steam propulsion. By the 1890s cruisers had abandoned sail and took on a modern appearance.  - A battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of large caliber guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was vital for any nation that desired to maintain command of the sea.  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - A cruiser is a type of warship. The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period. During the Age of Sail, the term \\"cruising\\" referred to certain kinds of missions  independent scouting, commerce protection, or raiding  fulfilled by a frigate or sloop, which were the \\"cruising warships\\" of a fleet.  - The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's , made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as \\"dreadnoughts\\", and earlier battleships became known as \\"pre-dreadnoughts\\". \\"Dreadnought\\"s design had two revolutionary features: an \\"all-big-gun\\" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships was a crucial catalyst in the intensifying naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. With the launch of a single ship, \\"Dreadnought\\", the scales of naval power were reset overnight. As a result, dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, during the lead up to World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships had outclassed \\"Dreadnought\\". These more powerful vessels were known as \\"super-dreadnoughts.\\" Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued to be used throughout World War II. The only surviving dreadnought is , located near the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site.  - The Grand Fleet was the main fleet of the British Royal Navy during the First World War.  - HMS Defence was a Minotaur - class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century , the last armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy . She was stationed in the Mediterranean when the First World War began and participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau . The ship was transferred to the Grand Fleet in January 1915 and remained there for the rest of her career . Defence was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the Battle of Jutland , the largest naval battle of the war . Escorting the main body of the Grand Fleet , the ship was fired upon by one German battlecruiser and four dreadnoughts as she attempted to engage a disabled German light cruiser . She was struck by two salvoes from the German ships that detonated her rear magazine . The fire from that explosion spread to the ship 's secondary magazines , which exploded in turn . There were no survivors .  - A light cruiser is a type of small- or medium-sized warship. The term is a shortening of the phrase \\"light armored cruiser\\", describing a small ship that carried armor in the same way as an armored cruiser: a protective belt and deck. Prior to this smaller cruisers had been of the protected cruiser model, possessing armored decks only.

Paragraph: Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour.

Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

In Sentence 1, it is mentioned that Nora responds \\"with a touch of meekness but at last with a sense of her separable self.\\" There's an implication of meekness in her behavior. Her sense of separable self also might indicate some level of independence or assertiveness. In Sentence 2, it is said that \\"Her meekness is counterbalanced by brevity.\\" This suggests that Nora communicates in a brief, concise manner, possibly to offset her timid nature. However, Sentence 1 does not provide any evidence of Nora's brevity in communication. Her separable self could mean a lot of things, but it does not necessarily mean that she's brief in her responses. Therefore, the truth of Sentence 1 does not guarantee the truth of Sentence 2.

Mr France, 41, from Watford, denies aiding and abetting a police officer to commit misconduct in public office. The trial is part of the Metropolitan Police's Operation Elveden. The operation is investigating alleged illegal payments to police and officials. Zoe Johnson QC, prosecuting, said Mr Edwards, 49, an officer in the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command based at Heathrow Airport, accessed police computer systems and passed on details of \\"both the victims and perpetrators of crime\\". She told the court: \\"This is not a case of whistle-blowing in a noble cause.\\" Ms Johnson described Pc Edwards' conduct as an \\"abuse of power\\" and asked: \\"If you were a victim of crime would you expect a police officer to sell your name and address to The Sun?\\" Ms Johnson told jurors to \\"brace\\" themselves before reading out the first headline of one of the stories allegedly sold by Pc Edwards: \\"Sexual Healing - BA man quits over squelchy stilettos fetish.\\" The story, published in July 2008, concerned a BA engineer who was caught on CCTV at Heathrow Airport parading up a makeshift catwalk in high heels, the court heard. Ms Johnson told the jury that Pc Edwards committed a \\"grievous abuse\\" of his power in looking up details of the incident even though no charges were made against the BA employee. He was paid Â£850 for the story, she said. In March 2010, Mr France wrote a front page story under the headline, \\"Heathrow Sex Scandal - Scanner Glamour Ding Dong\\".

Question: suppose more gases disperse quicker happens, how will it affect a LARGER white dwarf star.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"To answer the question, let's first understand the process of a star's life cycle and the formation of a white dwarf. Step 1: A star burns in space, using hydrogen as its primary fuel in a nuclear fusion process. This process produces a tremendous amount of energy that causes the star to emit light and heat. Step 2: Eventually, the star uses up all its hydrogen and can no longer sustain nuclear fusion with this fuel. At this point, the star begins to burn helium and other heavier elements. Step 3: As the star uses up its helium, it starts to expand and becomes a red giant due to an increase in temperature and pressure. Step 4: Once the red giant has exhausted its fuel, it will stop producing energy through nuclear fusion. The core of the star, which is composed of heavy elements, will start to contract under its own gravity. Step 5: The gasses in the outer layers of the star will start to disperse due to the lack of energy produced by the core. This process will eventually lead to the complete dispersion of the gaseous outer layers. Step 6: Only the core is left, which is now a dense ball of heavy elements. This core, known as a white dwarf, is very hot but does not undergo nuclear fusion. Now let's consider the given scenario: Suppose more gases disperse quicker while the core of a larger white dwarf star is forming. It's essential to understand that the mass of the white dwarf is primarily determined by the mass of the original star's core and not by the rate at which the gases disperse. If the gases disperse more quickly, it will not affect the mass of the white dwarf directly. Additionally, the properties of a white dwarf, such as its temperature and size, are determined by its mass and not the rate of gas dispersion. Hence, the answer to the question is:  C: No effect. Faster gas dispersion will not have a direct effect on the properties of a larger white dwarf star."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this summary: – A rep for Joe Biden has apologized to a reporter for his lengthy stay in a storage closet on Wednesday, where he waited to cover a fundraiser, reports Fox News. “This was the unfortunate mistake of an inexperienced staffer and the vice president's office has made sure it will never happen again,” said the vice president’s press secretary. Orlando Sentinel reporter Scott Powers spent more than an hour in the room in advance of Biden's arrival at the event, and complained to his editor—and now bloggers have blown the whole thing out of proportion, he writes. “I was kidnapped. That was news to me,” notes Powers in a blog post. His version of the story: Powers was asked to wait in a room that “felt like a closet.” He wasn’t locked in, but there was staffer outside who asked him to wait each time he emerged. Annoyed, Powers sent a photo to his editor, who posted it. “I thought it was funny,” Powers notes, and he quickly forgot about it. But “then the blogosphere went crazy,” and “now we have ClosetGate.”","output":"Title: \\"ClosetGate\\": A Misunderstanding Involving a Reporter, Joe Biden's Staff, and the Blogosphere On Wednesday, a bizarre incident took place when Orlando Sentinel reporter, Scott Powers, found himself waiting in what he described as a \\"closet-like room\\" for over an hour to cover a fundraiser featuring Vice President Joe Biden. The strange situation has now made headlines, with bloggers turning a seemingly innocent misunderstanding into a full-blown scandal dubbed \\"ClosetGate.\\" According to reports from Fox News, Powers was at the event to document Biden's fundraiser and was requested to wait in a small room before Biden's arrival. However, the vice president's press secretary has issued an apology for the journalist's lengthy stay in the confined space, stating, \\"This was the unfortunate mistake of an inexperienced staffer and the vice president's office has made sure it will never happen again.\\" While the incident in question could have easily been forgotten, the situation escalated when Powers decided to bring it up with his editor. Bemused and a little annoyed by the ordeal, he sent a photo of himself in the room to his editor, who then shared it online. What happened next surprised both Powers and his colleagues, as bloggers took the story and ran with it, eventually coining the term \\"ClosetGate\\" to describe the unfolding scandal. In a blog post addressing the issue, Powers had a few things to say, namely that the characterization of him being \\"kidnapped\\" was \\"news\\" to him. He clarified that, while the room he was asked to wait in did resemble a closet, he had not been locked in and was free to leave. However, he mentioned that each time he tried to exit the room, a staffer would ask him to wait. Powers expressed that he found the whole ordeal somewhat amusing, which is why he decided to share the story with his editor. Much to Powers' surprise, after the photo of him in the closet circulated online, \\"the blogosphere went crazy.\\" The story that initially started as a minor inconvenience and an odd anecdote soon became a sensationalized scandal, thanks to the power of the internet and the creativity of bloggers everywhere. What was once a simple misunderstanding between a reporter and a staffer quickly escalated into \\"ClosetGate.\\" Thus, whether one views \\"ClosetGate\\" as an amusing yet unfortunate mix-up or a more sinister attempt at confining press coverage, the incident serves as a fascinating illustration of how seemingly insignificant events can be distorted and amplified by the rapid fire nature of our interconnected world. In the end, while Powers treated the situation lightheartedly and received an apology from the Vice President's office, one key learning opportunity arises: the need for clear and effective communication between organizers and the media covering their events. As for the blogosphere, perhaps next time, it would be wise to double-check the facts before spinning a story out of control."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options:  A. digesting  B. being full  C. will not starve  D. survive  E. getting fat The answer to this question is:","output":"D. survive The primary goal of a poor person having food is to survive. Access to food is crucial in maintaining one's health and wellbeing. Without basic food intake, a person is unable to meet their physiological needs, ultimately threatening their survival. It is important to understand the context in which the question is being asked. In the case of a poor person, it is likely that their primary concern is meeting their basic requirements for sustenance and nourishment, rather than aiming for the satisfaction of other more nuanced or complex desires. Therefore, the other options mentioned, such as digesting (A), being full (B), not starving (C), and getting fat (E), are not the primary goals of a poor individual having food, although they may be secondary considerations or consequences. Digestion (A) is simply a physiological process that takes place when we consume food, regardless of our socioeconomic status. Being full (B) may be a temporary sensation of satisfaction, but does not necessarily guarantee survival.

(Associated Press)      The celebrations come at a time when the world's attention is focused on Ukraine where pro-Russian insurgents are preparing a referendum on secession.      Putin made no reference to the situation in Ukraine in his speech in Moscow, which focused on the historic importance of the victory over Nazi Germany. But he then headed to Crimea, where he is to oversee a massive navy parade.      In a sign of triumph, parading troops on Red Square included a marine unit from the Black Sea Fleet that flew the Crimean flag on its armored personnel carriers.      About 11,000 Russian troops proudly marched across Red Square to the tunes of marches and patriotic songs, followed by columns of dozens of tanks and rocket launchers. About 70 combat aircraft, including giant nuclear-capable strategic bombers, roared overhead.      Victory Day is Russia's most important secular holiday and a key element of the national identity, honoring the armed forces and the millions who died in World War II. This year it comes as Russia is locked in the worst crisis with the West since the end of the Cold War.      The parade, which featured massive Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles, comes a day after Putin visited the Defense Ministry's main operational center to watch a massive military exercise that simulated a retaliatory nuclear strike in response to an enemy attack. The official statements describing the maneuvers were strikingly blunt, reflecting simmering tensions with the West.      The West and the Ukrainian government accuse Russia of fomenting the unrest in Ukraine's east, where insurgents have seized government buildings in a dozen of cities and towns, and fought with government troops. They have set a referendum on independence for Sunday, a vote similar to a plebiscite that paved the way for Moscow's annexation of Crimea in March.      Putin's surprise call on Wednesday for delaying the referendum in eastern Ukraine appeared to reflect Russia's desire to distance itself from the separatists as it bargains with the West over a settlement to the Ukrainian crisis.      But insurgents in the Russian-speaking east defied Putin's call and said they would go ahead with the referendum. While reflecting the anger against the central government shared by many in the east, the move also supported Moscow's denial of engineering the mutiny.      The main eastern city of Donetsk was calm as a handful of veterans gathered to commemorate Victory Day, carrying former regiment flags and playing old patriotic songs.      In the Black Sea port of Odessa, which last week was rocked by violent clashes between pro-Russian forces and supporters of the central government that left nearly 50 people died, police arrested a municipal legislator and two pro-Russian activists accused of staging the riots.      Authorities also beefed up security in the city, fearing more violence, and the local governor issued an order banning public display of Russian flags. \\"We shouldn't allow emotions to spill into the streets,\\" Gov. Ihor Palytsa said.      In Kiev on Friday, a fire in a cable tunnel briefly interrupted broadcasts of several television channels. Viktoria Syumar, a deputy head of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said that the fire was an act of sabotage.      Putin said Wednesday that Russia had withdrawn its forces from the Ukrainian border, but Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve Warren said Thursday there had been no evidence of a pullback.      Russia wants Ukraine to adopt a new constitution that would give broad powers to its regions, helping Moscow to keep the country's east in its orbit. It also has sought guarantees that Ukraine would not join NATO. Ukraine has rejected the Russian demands.      Swiss President Didier Burkhalter, who currently chairs the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, offered a roadmap for settling the crisis during his meeting with Putin this week, but it hasn't been made public yet.      The OSCE's Secretary-General Lamberto Zannier visited Kiev Friday. He told The Associated Press that \\"we are now looking at how we can move ahead on process of de-escalation.\\" Zannier criticized the referendum in the east, calling it a \\"divisive initiative.\\"      \\"The OSCE will certainly not recognize the referendum of this kind,\\" he said.      The United States and the European Union have slapped travel bans and asset freezes on members of Putin's entourage in response to the annexation of Crimea. They threatened to introduce harsher sanctions if Russia continues to destabilize eastern Ukraine and tries to derail the May 25 presidential vote.      Despite the sanctions, Putin is set to travel to France in early June for a ceremony marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion that hastened the end of World War II, his first encounter with Western leaders since the start of the Ukrainian crisis.      __      Isachenkov reported from Moscow. Yuras Karmanau in Odessa, Ed Brown in Donetsk and Mark Rachkevych in Kiev contributed to this report. ||||| MOSCOW — Putting his personal seal on the annexation of Crimea, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia traveled on Friday to the naval port of Sevastopol, where he used the anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany to assert that Moscow had the right to take over the Black Sea peninsula.      Over the past decade, Mr. Putin has gradually turned Victory Day into a celebration of resurgent Russian power and nationalism. The visit to Sevastopol, in southwestern Crimea, the historical home of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, was a potent manifestation of his goal of reviving Russia as a global power.      The West reacted to the annexation in March with sanctions against Mr. Putin’s closest circle of advisers and a few significant companies. By going to Sevastopol, the Russian president effectively told Western leaders that Moscow would do as it pleased.      Mr. Putin’s visit coincided with new clashes in eastern Ukraine. Victory Day celebrations there were marred by an attack by Ukrainian government forces on a police station in Mariupol, where at least seven people were killed. In his speech on a naval quay, Mr. Putin, as he did at a ceremony in Red Square earlier in the day, stuck to the patriotic themes of the day — strength, heroism, struggle and resilience.      Photo      Speaking for less than four minutes, he ran through Sevastopol’s history: its naming by Catherine the Great 230 years ago; a 250-day Nazi siege the city endured; and its vote to rejoin Russia in March.      “I think 2014 will also be an important year in the annals of Sevastopol and our whole country, as the year when people living here firmly decided to be together with Russia, and thus confirmed their faith in the historic truth and the memory of our forefathers,” Mr. Putin said in remarks broadcast nationwide.      “There is a lot of work ahead, but we will overcome all the difficulties because we are together, and that means we have become even stronger,” he said.      The annexation provoked the greatest tensions between Russia and the West since the height of the Cold War. Mr. Putin has maintained that the territory had long belonged to Russia and that he was only righting a historical wrong. Separatists in Crimea, backed by the Russian military, organized a referendum in March in which an overwhelming majority of the residents, many of them ethnic Russians, chose to come under the control of Moscow.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine immediately issued a statement protesting Mr. Putin’s visit. It accused him of ignoring international law, the demands of the international community that Russia not occupy Crimea and a treaty between Russia and Ukraine that calls on both countries to respect their mutual borders.      “This provocation once again confirms that Russia deliberately chooses to escalate tensions in Russian-Ukrainian relations,” said the statement. “We urge the Russian side to return to civilized methods of interstate relations.”      The secretary general of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, condemned Mr. Putin’s visit as “inappropriate.” Speaking in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, Mr. Rasmussen said that NATO considered the annexation illegal, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Rasmussen also said that NATO still had “no visible evidence” that Russia was withdrawing its 40,000 troops from the border with Ukraine, as Mr. Putin had said it would on Wednesday.      Continue reading the main story Video      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      In Sevastopol harbor, the backdrop for Mr. Putin’s speech, the naval version of the Victory Day parade unfolded with 10 gray warships lined up at anchor. Before Mr. Putin spoke, television images showed the Russian president riding in a modest white naval launch through the harbor.      As he drew along aside each warship, he yelled into a microphone, “Hello, comrades!” and the naval personnel, arrayed at least two deep on deck in their blue dress uniforms, shouted back a ritual greeting to their commander in chief, followed by a rousing “Hurrah!”      People jammed the shores of the harbor to watch. After seizing many ships from Ukraine, Russia complained that they had been neglected and were barely more than scrap. The Kremlin has allocated 5 billion to refurbish the fleet.      Mr. Putin’s visit came just hours after a thundering Victory Day parade in Moscow, a lengthy review of Russia’s refurbished military and advanced hardware as it rolled through Red Square. The annual event came under global scrutiny in light of the tension over the future of Ukraine.      In the parade, the tribute to Crimea was not subtle. The first vehicle to enter the square behind row after row of tightly choreographed marching soldiers was an armored personnel carrier from a Black Sea Marines brigade, flying a large Crimean flag.      Some 11,000 soldiers and 150 military vehicles, including tanks and intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, rumbled through the square. Through cloudless skies, a flyover included 69 aircraft, marking the 69 years since the victory over Nazi Germany. During the parade, military bands playing marches and patriotic songs maintained a steady, thumping background beat.      In brief opening remarks before the first soldiers marched, Mr. Putin said the celebration represented all that makes Russia strong.      Photo      “This is the holiday when the invincible power of patriotism triumphs,” Mr. Putin said. “When all of us particularly feel what it means to be faithful to the Motherland and how important it is to defend its interests.”      Often, Mr. Putin’s annual Victory Day speech is both a national pep rally and a summary of the state of the Russian Federation, with the president using the address to emphasize important positions on foreign or domestic policy. This year, however, he adhered to the day’s theme of patriotism in the few minutes he spoke.      In Donetsk, a provincial capital that has fallen largely under the control of pro-Russian separatists, posters went up around the city showing red flags and Soviet military medals and praising “the heroes of Donbass,” as the region is known.      Outside the headquarters of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, the separatist political group there, a frank and unapologetic celebration of Stalin was taking place, an indication of how the current conflict reflects divisions over the legacy of World War II. A flag showing Stalin’s mustachioed face and the phrase “Death to fascists” flapped lazily in a morning breeze.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “Kiev doesn’t want us to celebrate this holiday because they are supported by neo-Nazis,” said Yevgeny Ivanov, 44, a supporter of the Donetsk People’s Republic, as he was interviewed in a city park.      Victory Day has always been a fraught holiday in Ukraine, even under ordinary circumstances, because Ukrainians fought on both sides. The Ukrainian Partisan Army, which at times was loosely allied with Nazi Germany — because it considered any opponent of the hated Soviet Union an ally, its defenders say — became an inspiration for nationalist groups that arose in the 1990s.      The interim government in Kiev has discouraged large marches this year because of concerns about an outbreak of violence.      In the Black Sea port of Odessa, Ukraine, the city authorities feared that pro-Russian groups, which lost at least 40 supporters killed in street fighting and a fire last week, would use the day to regroup and stage a counterattack by seizing administrative buildings. The authorities decreed that the authorized celebration there should be confined to one park. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"President Vladimir Putin visited Crimea to celebrate a big holiday and to show that Russia took over the area near the Black Sea.

Reuven Amitai stated that the closest thing to actual Mongol-Frankish military coordination was when Prince Edward of England attempted to coordinate activities with Abaga in 1271. Amitai also mentioned the other attempts towards cooperation, but said, \\"In none of these episodes, however, can we speak of Mongols and troops from the Frankish West being on the Syrian mainland at the same time.\\" Timothy May described the alliance as having its peak at the Council of Lyon in 1274, but that it began to unravel in 1275 with the death of Bohemond, and May too admitted that the forces never engaged in joint operations. Alain Demurger, in his own book The Last Templar, said that an alliance was not sealed until 1300.There also continues to be debate about whether or not an alliance would have been a wise idea, and whether the Crusaders at that point in history were even relevant to the Persian-Mongol conflict. The 20th-century historian Glenn Burger said, \\"The refusal of the Latin Christian states in the area to follow Hethum's example and adapt to changing conditions by allying themselves with the new Mongol empire must stand as one of the saddest of the many failures of Outremer.\\" This was similar to the view of Steven Runciman, who argued, \\"Had the Mongol alliance been achieved and honestly implemented by the West, the existence of Outremer would almost certainly have been prolonged.

His life seems morose and empty without her, leaving him completely dispirited. His once-coveted career in art seems to desert him as he battles one failed painting after another. In his loneliness, he starts seeking solace in alcohol, further alienating Scott from reality and the world around him. One evening, while nursing his wounds in a dimly-lit bar, Scott encounters a mysterious woman named Elise, who bears a striking resemblance to his late wife. Her peculiar charm and allure seem mystifying, igniting a new, unknown emotion within him. He starts spending more time with her, trying to fill the void left by Emily. Elise appears to be devoid of any past, yet she seems to know eerily accurate details about Scott's life. As Scott becomes increasingly involved with Elise, he notices inexplicable occurrences around him. Objects around the house seem to move on their own, and he can't shake the feeling that someone is watching him. Troubled by these incidents, Scott's best friend, Roger, persuades him to visit a psychologist, Dr. Matthews, who specializes in people coping with loss. During the therapy sessions, Scott delves deeper into his painful memories and dreams, discovering subtle hints that may lead to a new understanding of his wife's death. He finds himself torn between two worlds – one where he mourns Emily and the other where Elise sparks a sinister hope. Eventually, Scott learns a hidden truth about Elise – she is the spirit of his wife's estranged twin sister, who had been harboring spite and envy towards Emily. In her quest for revenge, Elise caused the accident that killed Emily and is now trying to take over her life. In the climax, Scott is pushed to a moment of extreme when he confronts Elise about her manipulations. Both Elise's spirit and the memory of Emily clash within the house, forcing Scott to remember the love and warmth of his marriage. Overwhelmed by the emotional intensity and terrified for his life, Scott makes a desperate attempt to banish Elise's spirit. With the help of Roger and Dr. Matthews, Scott performs a ritual that seems to purge the vengeful spirit from his life. As rain pours outside, Scott runs out of the house, releasing a cry of both fear and catharsis. In the aftermath, Scott seems to find peace and starts rebuilding his life. Gradually, his creativity returns, and he begins to transform his grief into a masterpiece that honors Emily's memory. In the end, the resilience of love and art triumphs over darkness and sorrow. Shattered Illusions captures the essence of human emotions and the invincibility of the spirit during life's most challenging moments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.  - The Isle of Wight Festival is a music festival which takes place annually on the Isle of Wight in England. It was originally a counterculture event held from 1968 to 1970.  - Filmmaking (or in an academic context, film production) is the process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete.  - A ceramic is an inorganic, nonmetallic solid material comprising metal, nonmetal or metalloid atoms primarily held in ionic and covalent bonds. This article gives an overview of ceramic materials from the point of view of materials science.   - Pottery is the craft of making ceramic material into pots or potterywares using mud. Major types of potterywares include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made by a \\"potter\\" is called a \\"pottery\\" (plural \\"potteries\\"). The technical definition of \\"pottery\\" used by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is \\"all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, structural, and refractory products.\\"  - Scrapbooking is a method, an art for preserving, presenting, arranging personal and family history in the form of a book, box, card.

It was recorded and released in 1972 as Grunt FTR - 1007 , and peaked at No. 20 in America .  - Industrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production. Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication. This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation.  - A rock festival, often considered synonymous with pop festival, is a large-scale rock music concert, featuring multiple acts performing an often diverse range of popular music including rock, pop, folk, electronic, and related genres.  - Jefferson Airplane was a rock band based in San Francisco, California, who pioneered psychedelic rock. Formed in 1965, the group defined the San Francisco Sound and was the first from the Bay Area to achieve international commercial success. They were headliners at the three most famous American rock festivals of the 1960sMonterey (1967), Woodstock (1969) and Altamont (1969)and the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968) in England. Their 1967 break-out album \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" ranks on the short list of most significant recordings of the \\"Summer of Love\\". Two songs from that album, \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\", are among \\"Rolling Stone's\\" \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\\"  - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek  \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and  \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.  - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - The San Francisco Sound refers to rock music performed live and recorded by San Francisco-based rock groups of the mid-1960s to early 1970s. It was associated with the counterculture community in San Francisco during these years. San Francisco is a westward-looking port city, a city that at the time was 'big enough' but not manic like New York City or spread out like Los Angeles. Hence, it could support a 'scene'. According to journalist Ed Vulliamy, \\"A core of Haight Ashbury bands played with each other, for each other, for free and at Chet Helms's Avalon Ballroom and Bill Graham's Fillmore.\\"  - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.  - Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast.  - ) is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word \\"origami\\" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat sheet square of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word \\"\\" to refer to designs which use cuts, although cutting is more characteristic of Chinese papercrafts.  - Woodworking is the activity or skill of making items from wood, and includes cabinet making (Cabinetry and Furniture), wood carving, joinery, carpentry, and woodturning.  - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.  - A studio is an artist's or worker's workroom, or the catchall term for an artist and their employees who work within that studio. This can be for the purpose of acting, architecture, painting, pottery (ceramics), sculpture, origami, woodworking, scrapbooking, photography, graphic design, filmmaking, animation, industrial design, radio or television production broadcasting or the making of music. The term is also used for the workroom of dancers, often specified to dance studio.  - The Summer of Love was a social phenomenon that occurred during the summer of 1967, when as many as 100,000 people, mostly young people sporting hippie fashions of dress and behavior, converged in San Francisco's neighborhood Haight-Ashbury. Although hippies also gathered in many other places in the U.S., Canada and Europe, San Francisco was at that time the most publicized location for hippie fashions.  - Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners.  - Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \\"graphic design\\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage.  - Surrealistic Pillow is the second album by American rock band Jefferson Airplane, released on February 1, 1967, by RCA Victor (LSP-3766 [stereo] and LPM-3766 [mono]). It is the first album by the band with vocalist Grace Slick and drummer Spencer Dryden. The album peaked at number three on the \\"Billboard\\" album chart and has been certified a gold album by the RIAA.  - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.

Dunwoody from an impressive rise through ranks - showcasing her exceptional talents, dedication, and leadership abilities. A Beacon of Inspiration Lt. Gen. Dunwoody's monumental nomination represents a significant milestone, not just for herself and the Army but also for all women in the military.

Dunwoody's nomination, she serves as an inspiration for the future generations of women in the armed forces, demonstrating that it is possible to break through barriers and achieve remarkable career success, regardless of historical limitations. A look into Lt. Gen. Ann Dunwoody's Career Lt. Gen. Dunwoody's exceptional career has seen her take on numerous challenges and responsibilities. Her military career has spanned over three decades, wherein she has undergone various postings in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Her multitude of roles include high-ranking positions within the 82nd Airborne Division, the XVIII Airborne Corps, and the Combined Armed Support Command. With such a commanding background, her nomination to head the Army Materiel Command is a clear indication of her unmatched expertise and dedication in logistics and supply chain management. Looking Ahead The groundbreaking nomination of Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody to become the United States Army's first-ever female four-star general is a testament to her exceptional skills, experience, and commitment to the military. Not only does it indicate a progressive shift within the U.S. military establishment, but it also serves to inspire all women within the armed forces.

He also was the target of a previously undisclosed six-year investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, beginning with an anonymous tip that Mr. Devaney was living too much of the good life. SEC officials abandoned the probe last year. But like many other investors who were hammered or humiliated by the crisis, the numbers are adding up in Mr. Devaney's favor again.

Losses on similar bets nearly destroyed the firm in 2008. \\"My niche is trading very complex and extremely illiquid stuff,\\" says Mr. Devaney, who stayed up until 3 a.m. Wednesday and Thursday to jostle in a bond auction. He claims to be one of the biggest market makers in the world for certain types of debt. He spends many weekends with his wife and three children at their 16,000-square-foot home in the Bahamas, usually getting there on a 125-foot yacht named Dorothy Ann after his mother. Mr. Devaney says it is the only \\"toy\\" he kept. Key Biscayne, FL Friday Former hedge-fund manager John Devaney in his car in Key Biscayne, Fla. Mr. Devaney, 41 years old, seldom talks openly about his rise and fall. He still is living down a reputation as one of the hedge-fund managers whose gargantuan appetite for risky bonds worsened the real-estate mess by encouraging lenders to make more and more home loans. \\"The consumer has to be an idiot to take one of those loans, but it has been one of our best-performing investments,\\" he said in a 2007 interview with Money magazine, referring to option adjustable-rate mortgages with tiny initial payments that soon skyrocketed. Mr. Devaney says now that he \\"was determined to become a multibillionaire.\\" The broker-dealer firm he started in 1999, at the age of 29, at one time traded as much as 1 billion in bonds per month. He achieved this dramatic growth with bets on out-of-favor assets, such as aircraft leases following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In 2005, he started a hedge fund that operated separately from his broker-dealer, using borrowed money to multiply the size of his bets on subprime mortgage bonds. By mid-2007, though, mounting troubles in the mortgage market caused Mr. Devaney to freeze his hedge fund and stop investors from withdrawing their money. Then came the fire sale of his personal assets, including a Lear jet and a Renoir that were emblems of Mr. Devaney's conspicuous consumption. Mr. Devaney closed the hedge fund in July 2008. Investors walked away with nothing. Since then, he has settled a handful of investor-related lawsuits. Time magazine ranked Mr. Devaney in 2009 one of the \\"25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis.\\" (In an online version of the list, he was No. 18, just ahead of Ponzi-scheme mastermind Bernard L. Madoff.) John Devaney is again trading subprime mortgage bonds, and says his firm's returns in recent years have been 'very, very good.' Mr. Devaney says he still gets occasional hate mail about the ranking, particularly from the \\"little bit absurd\\" Occupy Wall Street protesters. He also found it hard to shake the SEC. In a report last year, the agency's inspector general disclosed that officials were tipped off in 2004 to a hedge-fund trader's \\"overly extravagant lifestyle.\\" The report didn't identify the trader, but it was Mr. Devaney, according to people familiar with the matter. After a two-month examination of Mr. Devaney's firm, SEC officials in Miami had concerns about \\"potentially fraudulent markups\\" and \\"a securities parking scheme,\\" where assets are held in other accounts to disguise their true ownership, the report said. The Miami office started a formal investigation but bounced the case to the SEC's regional office in Los Angeles after one of the agency's senior lawyers went to work for Mr. Devaney, these people said. SEC officials in Los Angeles found no evidence of fraud. The investigation was dropped in 2007, but Miami officials began a new probe after Mr. Devaney's hedge fund collapsed. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Devaney says investigators talked to \\"every one of my employees\\" and examined \\"two years of the operating history of the fund…anything they could find.\\" There were \\"no smoking emails,\\" he adds. To bolster his side of the story, Mr. Devaney told officials that he poured an additional 14 million of his own money into the hedge fund two months before it imploded. The SEC didn't take enforcement action against Mr. Devaney. He says he got a \\"very nice letter, thanking us for our cooperation and closing their case.\\" Mr. Devaney has had no regulatory charges filed against him during his 14-year career, records show. Subsequently, the SEC's inspector general received an anonymous tip that Mr. Devaney had not been thoroughly investigated. A separate prove into that allegation also ended with no finding of wrongdoing. The SEC's own actions were investigated after an anonymous tipster told its inspector general that staff members overlooked a \\"massive fraud\\" tied to Mr. Devaney. The probe ended with no finding of wrongdoing. He says he has no hard feelings toward the SEC and supports the agency's pursuit of crisis-related wrongdoing. \\"I'm not angry at all. I believe in having rules, and I play by the rules,\\" he says. \\"When you're very successful, people can make allegations.\\" Mr. Devaney has just 10 employees at his office in the Florida Keys, but says he is earning millions of dollars a month. His net worth is about half of its 2007 peak of 250 million, he says, and the firm's returns from 2009 to 2011 \\"were very, very good,\\" he adds. \\"Work was my life, and then this whole crisis happened,\\" he says. \\"It was a blessing in disguise, because I know 10 billionaires, and every single one of them is divorced.\\" Write to Jean Eaglesham at jean.eaglesham@wsj.com Summary:","output":"Once reviled for contributing to the real-estate debacle that fueled the financial crisis, former hedge-fund manager John Devaney is making a comeback. His personal fortune, once decimated in the financial crisis, has recovered significantly due to booming business at his downsized United Capital Markets Inc., particularly in subprime mortgage bonds. Devaney, who managed to avoid regulatory charges throughout his career, now operates with fewer employees and continues to earn millions of dollars a month, with the firm's returns between 2009 to 2011 being \\"very, very good\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: Misconceptions about HIV 'feed discrimination about the disease' Only four out of 10 people knew 95% infections in UK due to unsafe sex. Highest number of gay men diagnosed with HIV in 2011. Article:","output":"Title: Debunking Misconceptions About HIV: A Step Towards Reducing Discrimination and Raising Awareness Introduction: Research has shown that misconceptions about HIV play a significant role in perpetuating discrimination against those living with the disease. A study reveals that only four out of 10 people were aware that 95% of HIV infections in the UK were due to unsafe sex. Moreover, the stigmatization of HIV has led to a lack of awareness, with 2011 seeing the highest number of gay men diagnosed with the disease. This article aims to debunk some of these misconceptions and promote a better understanding of HIV to combat discrimination and ensure proper preventative measures. Step 1: Presenting the statistics (establishing credibility) To begin, it is crucial to present the alarming statistics on the lack of awareness about HIV. According to the study, a mere 40% of the population knew the risk factors of the disease. Additionally, the highest number of gay men were diagnosed with HIV in 2011. These statistics serve as a wake-up call, emphasizing the need for accurate information and debunking misconceptions that contribute to discrimination. Step 2: Debunking misconceptions (providing accurate information) One of the key steps to reducing discrimination and stigma associated with HIV is dispelling the myths surrounding the disease. Common misconceptions include: - Believing that HIV only affects certain demographics, such as gay men or intravenous drug users. In reality, HIV can affect anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or lifestyle choices. Unprotected sex is the leading cause of HIV infections, accounting for 95% of cases in the UK. - Assuming that HIV can be transmitted through casual contact, such as hugging, handshakes, or sharing utensils. HIV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, sharing needles, or mother-to-child transmission. It cannot be transmitted through casual contact, making it necessary to educate the public on the facts to reduce discrimination. Step 3: Highlighting the consequences of discrimination (raising awareness) Discrimination against those living with HIV has several negative consequences, including: - People reluctant to get tested due to fear of discrimination, consequently leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment options. - Individuals living with HIV being isolated from their communities, affecting their mental health and well-being. - Misconceptions around HIV transmission often leading to avoidance of those living with the disease, further intensifying discrimination and misinformation. Step 4: Encouraging empathy and education (promoting change) To diminish discrimination and raise awareness about HIV, we must promote empathy and provide accurate information. This involves: - Encouraging open discussions around HIV and its transmission methods, debunking misconceptions in the process. - Providing support and understanding for those living with HIV, treating them with respect and care. - Promoting safe sex practices and comprehensive sexual education programs, targeting various demographics and age groups. Conclusion: The persistence of misconceptions about HIV undoubtedly contributes to discrimination against those living with the disease, leading to isolation, fear, and a lack of understanding. By debunking these myths and raising awareness through education, we can foster a more empathetic society where individuals living with HIV are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Furthermore, a well-informed populace can better understand the importance of safe sex practices, hopefully resulting in a decline in new HIV diagnoses."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Use this fact to answer the question: changes in an environment cause plants to adapt to survive If a plant is in an environment with a lot of oxygen, and then oxygen levels very slightly drop, the plant will","output":"need to adapt to the new environment in order to continue to survive and thrive. Plants, like all living organisms, have evolved over time to suit their specific environments. When the conditions within an environment change, plants must either adapt or risk being outcompeted by other plant species that can better tolerate the new conditions. In the case of an environment with slightly decreased oxygen levels, plants will need to adjust various aspects of their physiology and overall functioning in order to continue obtaining sufficient oxygen for their survival. The primary way that plants obtain oxygen is through the process of respiration, in which they use the oxygen in the air to break down stored sugars and produce energy to support their growth, development, and reproduction. Here are some possible ways that a plant may adapt to an environment with slightly reduced oxygen levels: 1. Increase the number of stomata: Stomata are microscopic pores typically found on the underside of leaves that allow for gas exchange with the surrounding environment. By increasing the number of stomata, a plant can potentially increase the amount of oxygen it takes up and compensate for the lower oxygen availability in the environment. 2. Modifying the size and shape of leaves: Changing the leaves' morphology may result in a more efficient uptake of oxygen. For instance, plants could develop larger, thinner leaves to increase the leaf surface area, allowing for greater uptake of oxygen through stomata. 3. Enhance root growth and structure: Adjusting root structure may improve a plant's ability to access oxygen in the soil. Developing more extensive root systems, for example, could provide a larger surface area for oxygen absorption from the soil, and specialized cells called aerenchyma can increase gas exchange and transport within plants. 4. Altering biochemical and metabolic processes: Plants could potentially adapt by modifying various biochemical pathways involved in respiration to be more efficient under lower oxygen levels, allowing them to continue to produce the necessary energy to support their growth and reproduction. They might also increase the activity of certain enzymes that help facilitate respiration under low-oxygen conditions. 5. Adjusting photosynthetic process: To compensate for the reduced oxygen levels, plants may increase their photosynthetic rate in order to produce more oxygen during the day, which they will utilize during respiration. This adaptation could potentially aid plants in maintaining a balance between oxygen production and consumption. 6. Symbiotic relationships with microorganisms: Forming partnerships with certain microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi, could help plants cope with decreased oxygen levels. These microorganisms might enhance the plant's ability to access oxygen or aid in metabolic processes that require oxygen. In summary, when a plant is in an environment with slightly lower oxygen levels than it is used to, it must adapt to the changing conditions in order to survive. Various ways that plants may adapt can involve adjusting their morphology, physiology, and biochemical processes to better capture and utilize the available oxygen. The specific adaptations employed by a plant will depend on the species, the extent of the environmental change, and the other environmental pressures that the plant is facing."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Does sex cause acne?","output":"While these two questions are related, they do not have the exact same meaning. Both questions address the topic of acne and its potential linkage with sexual activities, but they approach the subject from different angles. To fully distinguish their meanings, let's break down both questions individually and assess the assumptions behind each one. 1. Why does masturbation cause acne, but sex does not? This question assumes that masturbation causes acne and that sex, as a separate activity, does not have the same effect. It seeks an explanation as to why there is a difference between these two activities when it comes to acne formation. It is important to note that there is no definitive scientific evidence proving that masturbation causes acne. Some people may believe that masturbation causes acne due to hormonal fluctuations, but this has not been conclusively proven. As for sex, it too can lead to hormonal fluctuations, as well as increased blood flow and the release of endorphins. However, these physiological responses are generally not considered to directly cause acne.  Nevertheless, sexual activities could potentially contribute to acne if they result in increased stress or anxiety, poor hygiene, or lack of sleep. These factors can weaken one's immune system and affect hormonal balance, which in turn, impact the skin's health. However, these factors are not directly associated with masturbation or sex itself. Instead, it would be more accurate to say that certain lifestyle factors, when combined with sexual activities, could have an indirect impact on one's acne risk. 2. Does sex cause acne? This question seeks clarification on whether there is a direct causality between sexual activity and acne. It omits any specific mention of masturbation. As discussed earlier, there is no definitive scientific evidence proving that sex or masturbation causes acne. Rather, factors such as hygiene, stress, and sleep can impact a person's propensity for developing acne. While there could be indirect associations, it would be erroneous to directly attribute acne to sexual activity. In summary, the first question assumes that there is a difference between masturbation and sex when it comes to causing acne and requests an explanation for this presumed disparity. The second question simply asks whether there is a causal link between sexual activity and acne, without asserting any difference between masturbation and sex. Both questions reveal a curiosity about potential associations between acne and sexual activities, but their underlying assumptions and focus are not the same. It is important to remember that while there might be indirect links between specific lifestyle factors and acne, there is currently no conclusive scientific evidence directly tying acne to either masturbation or sex."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: WHITE HOUSE — \\"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,\\" President Donald Trump vowed Monday amid growing outrage over his administration forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \\"what's happening in Europe … we can't allow that to happen to the United States — not on my watch.\\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \\"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \\"pawns\\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \\"I say that is a very cowardly response,\\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \\"to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.\\" Trump's Republican party controls both chambers in Congress, and the family border policies were set by his administration.

Title: So very beautiful Review: I found that \\"notre clavecinist canadien\\", M. Wright, stated very well what I also feel. This is music of the highest order, noble in tone, deeply feeling but restrained, beautiful in both harmony and melody. The instrument's warmth and exceptional richness of timbre never detracts from its essential clarity of speech. Mr. Rousset's command of the instrument, the idiom, the complex repertory of ornamentation, and not least the gallant spirit of the music itself is commendable.My only reservations are with his tendency occasionally to rush dotted notes, and, in a few instances, to toss off certain of the lighter pieces a bit too hastily. But let this be \\"praising with faint damning\\"!Anyone who loves late 17th century French music should purchase this gem!J. v.Lennep, \\"luthier americain\\" Answer:","output":"Based on the content and tone of the review left by the customer, I would say that they are predominantly satisfied with the product. The title, \\"So very beautiful,\\" already suggests a positive experience and overall appreciation for the music. Throughout the review, the customer describes the music as \\"of the highest order\\" and \\"noble in tone,\\" further highlighting their admiration for the product. They consistently praise different aspects of the music, like the instrument’s warmth, richness, and clarity, along with the musician’s command of the instrument and the gallant spirit in which the music was portrayed. The customer also recommends the product to anyone who loves late 17th-century French music, referring to it as a \\"gem.\\" However, it is important to note that the customer does have a few minor criticisms – specifically, the musician's tendency to occasionally rush dotted notes and play certain lighter pieces too hastily. Despite these reservations, the customer ultimately downplays the significance of these minor flaws, referring to them as \\"praising with faint damning.\\" Taking all of this information into account, I would conclude that the customer is indeed satisfied with the product. Although they express a few reservations about the performance, these concerns do not outweigh their overall positive impressions of the music and the listening experience. Consequently, the customer's satisfaction is clearly reflected through their praise, recommendation, and appreciation for the beauty of the product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They are different, and we will show you some proof in a fun video. Merton is a person who became famous on the internet. He played piano and sang funny songs for people who were using their computers to chat with him. He wore glasses and a hoodie to hide his real face, so nobody really knew what he looked like. People liked watching Merton's videos because he was very creative and made them laugh. Ben Folds is also a person who is really good at playing the piano. But he has been around for longer than Merton. Ben has made many albums of songs that people love to listen to. He also performs concerts where people go to see and hear him play his music live. Ben Folds doesn't hide his face like Merton does, so people know what he looks like. Now, some people thought that maybe Merton and Ben Folds were the same person because they are both good at playing the piano and have a similar style. But, guess what? They are not the same person! We have a fun video to show you that proves they are different people. In this video, you will see Merton and Ben Folds playing the piano together. They are on the same stage, at the same time, and they even talk to each other! This shows that they are two separate people, and not the same person pretending to be both Merton and Ben Folds.  Isn't that exciting? Now you know Merton and Ben Folds are different people, and you can tell your friends about it.

First of all, the boys' age is not mentioned in the original statement. Describing the boys as \\"young\\" implies additional information that is not provided in the original text. Instead, the first statement may simply mean that there are two boys diving into the water, but we have no specifications about their age. Second, the manner in which the boys are diving is not explicitly mentioned. The conclusion that they are diving \\"headfirst\\" is an assumption made without direct evidence mentioned in the text. The original statement emphatically says the boys are diving into the water, but it does not mention any specific technique, style, or position in which they are doing so. Third, the condition of the water is also not mentioned in the original statement, namely, the presence of small waves. Based on the initial information, we can only ascertain the fact that the boys are diving into water, but there could be various environmental conditions like still water, rough waves, clear water, or murky water. Assuming that there are small waves is adding extra detail that was not initially provided. While it is not impossible that the original statement could be describing a scene where two young boys dive headfirst into water with small waves on it, concluding so with certainty would involve making assumptions that are not substantiated by the information provided.

About 1/3 of the world's population has English as its mother tongue. 75% of the world's mail is in English. English is the official language or is widely used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, India, United Arab Ernirates, Canada, the United States, Panama, Surinam, South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya. English is the language that is most often studied as a foreign language in the European Union (by 89% of schoolchildren), followed by French (32%), German (l8%), and Spanish (8%). It is also the most studied in China, Japan, and South Korea. Books, magazines, and newspapers are written in English in many countries around the world. English is also the widest used language in science. In 1997, the Science Citation Index reported that 95% of its articles were written in English, but only half of their authors came from English-speaking countries. Why has English become a world language? The British colonized (......) large parts of the world, spreading their language to new areas. The United Kingdom and the United States are both important nations in the world. When doing business with these nations, knowing English is an advantage. As non-English-speaking countries realized that, industry and business hired people who spoke English, or required their workers to attend language courses. English is the international language of technology. With English being so widespread, it can make those who come from English-speaking countries already feel that they don't need to learn a foreign language. This is not good because one learns to understand a culture better if one knows the language, and one may also enjoy reading original books. Question: The following are all the reasons for English to be widely used EXCEPT that  _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"many schools asked the students to study English\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"many schools asked the students to study English\\" is not explicitly mentioned as a reason in the given article for English to be widely used. However, it is indirectly suggested through the statistics on the percentage of schoolchildren in the European Union studying English as a foreign language. According to the article, the main reasons for English gaining its status as a world language are: 1. British colonization - The British colonized large parts of the world, spreading the English language to new areas. 2. Importance of the United Kingdom and the United States - Both nations are highly influential on the global stage, making English advantageous for international business and diplomacy. 3. Industry and business demands - Non-English-speaking countries adopted English in industry and business, hiring English speakers or requiring workers to attend language courses. 4. English as the international language of technology - The widespread use of English in the tech world makes it a lingua franca in this sector. 5. English as the dominant language in science - As mentioned, 95% of articles in the Science Citation Index were written in English in 1997. Although the fact that many schools ask students to study English is not listed as a separate reason, it is indeed a contributing factor to the widespread use of English. Schools around the world often prioritize English as a second language, which in turn creates a global workforce proficient in English, further solidifying its status as a world language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding  I am facing a new situation today: Two different types of animals live in the same habitat but have vastly different behaviors. Animals A and B are both the same size which is relatively small. Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group likely relies on confusing potential predators, group A or B? Answer:","output":"Group B likely relies on confusing potential predators. In the background article, it is mentioned that species moving in synchrony, like schools of sardines and flocks of starlings, exhibit herding behavior to create a confusion effect that helps them avoid predators. This confusion effect is more effective when more individuals are present.  In your new situation, Animal B lives in large groups and moves in unison, which matches the description of species relying on confusion to evade predators. On the other hand, Animal A lives in smaller groups of 4 or 5, which suggests that they might depend more on other strategies like shared vigilance, as exhibited by meerkats, rather than confusing predators. Therefore, it is more likely that Group B relies on confusing potential predators to protect themselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process:  - A star forms - The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula - The star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose star is in a stable environment happens, how will it affect a SMALLER white dwarf star.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose involves a stable environment around a star. Assuming such an environment, the process of the star's life cycle you've outlined would generally proceed undisturbed, as these changes mostly depend on the star's internal processes and inherent properties such as its mass. For a smaller white dwarf star in the vicinity, a stable environment should not directly affect its evolution because the life cycle of a star is primarily determined by its mass, composition, and own gravitational forces.  However, there could be indirect influences. If the mentioned star and the white dwarf are in a binary system (two stars orbiting a common center), changes in the larger star could indeed influence the smaller star. For instance, when the larger star becomes a red giant, its expanded outer layers might transfer mass to the white dwarf. This accretion of mass can push the white dwarf over its stability limit (known as the Chandrasekhar Limit), causing it to explode as a type Ia supernova. But if the two stars are not in a binary system or sufficiently close, the effect of changes in one star on the other would not be significant. In terms of gravitational forces, stars need to be relatively close to each other for significant interaction.  Without specific details on the relationship and distance between the two celestial bodies, it's challenging to definitively assess the precise impact. But in general, for a white dwarf star, a stable environment would likely allow it to cool and fade slowly over billions of years without interference."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. \\"Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies,\\" said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md. It \\"may well be\\" that theft of business data is \\"as serious a strategic threat to national security\\" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs. The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. Any secret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the air. Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder. They need only position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait. \\"You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time,\\" Mr. Matchett said, adding : \\"It's a pretty good bet they won't get caught.\\" The only way to catch an electronic thief, he said, is to set him up with erroneous information.  Question: \\"Where do amateurs need to position themselves to pirate a secret transmitted over the air?\\" Response: \\"Near the company's satellite dish\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. Amateurs need to position themselves near the company's satellite dish to pirate a secret transmitted over the air."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Susan liked the tea drink from the store better than the smoothie, because the","output":"tea drink had a wonderfully delicate fusion of flavors that appealed to her sophisticated palate, while the smoothie was too cloyingly sweet and heavy for her taste. Besides, the unique blend of loose-leaf teas and herbs used for the tea drink, she found, not only tasted fabulous but also had remarkable health benefits. Her love for the tea drink from the store had turned into somewhat of a daily ritual, making it her preferred beverage of choice. On a particularly warm and sunny afternoon, Susan decided to go to the store to get her usual fix of the tea drink. As she strolled along the sidewalk, her mind wandered to the beautiful botanical garden she had visited the previous weekend. She had loved looking at the diverse flora, which included various tea plants and aromatic herbs. The vibrant colors and tantalizing scents at the garden made her appreciate the complexity of her much-loved tea drink even more. Upon reaching the store, Susan noticed that it was buzzing with activity. The usual barista, a young woman named Emma, greeted her with a warm smile. Although they had exchanged pleasantries numerous times before, today, Susan felt compelled to ask Emma about how her tea drink was prepared. Emma, ever so enthusiastic and eager to talk about her passion, dove into a wonderfully detailed explanation. She explained that the store sourced the finest varieties of tea leaves from around the world. They paid special attention to the growing conditions and harvesting times to ensure that they get the most fragrant and flavorful tea possible. The tea blend used in Susan's favorite drink included a mix of Assam, Darjeeling, and Blue Mountain tea leaves, which gave it its rich and complex base. However, what set this tea drink apart from the rest was the inclusion of exotic herbs. Emma went on to explain that they used a carefully selected combination of locally grown herbs and imported ones. The delightful marriage of rosemary, thyme, and lemongrass was what gave the drink its invigorating aroma, while a touch of lavender and sage added an enticing layer of complexity. Susan listened attentively, her awe and admiration for the tea drink growing with each new revelation. To enhance the flavors even further, Emma revealed that they used a special brewing technique that allowed the tea leaves and herbs to release their full potential. By steeping the blend at the optimal temperature for a precise amount of time, they extracted a perfect balance of flavors and health-boosting antioxidants. She showed Susan a glimpse of the state-of-the-art tea infuser they used in their store, which meticulously controlled the brewing process. As Susan sipped on her freshly prepared tea drink, she could sense the thoughtfulness poured into each and every ingredient and brewing step. For her, it wasn't merely a beverage; it was a testament to the artistry, craftsmanship, and dedication of the people behind it. From that day onward, Susan's connection to her tea drink became even stronger. Each time she took a sip, she was reminded not only of the beautiful botanical garden she had visited, but also of the care and attention to detail that Emma and her team put into creating the perfect blend. Susan started to explore other tea varieties, attend tea tastings, and even took up gardening to grow some of her favorite herbs. The journey of discovering the intricacies of the tea drink opened up a whole new world for Susan to savor, with countless scents, flavors, and textures waiting to be explored. Her newfound passion transformed her life in ways she could never have imagined, as she found solace, beauty, and a profound connection with nature in every single cup. And it all began with her deep appreciation for an extraordinary tea drink from a humble store."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Review: When a film has no fewer than FIVE different titles, it usually means several things and almost always means that the film has major flaws somewhere. Necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad. I saw the version on video called Rosemary's Disciples. Yes, I am sure it differs from other versions, but I am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have - going to be really any better. The story is perhaps the biggest problem: the film opens with Laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for occultists(yep, it gets bad this early!). The town is called Lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the \\"owner\\" of the town are allowed in. Soon we find that everyone living in Lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of Mr. Cato - the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son back(hence the name Necromancy). The people in the town do witch kind of stuff - have ceremonies, some like wearing a goat's head, and promiscuity abounds(not much really shown in this area), but none of these people are very good actors. Mr. Cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally larger-than-life movie maverick Orson Welles. Welles is misused, but, make no mistake, he is the best thing in this movie. And that is really the saddest part of Necromancy as Welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial guidance. In one scene at a party, director Bert I Gordon keeps going back to Welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames! It looked ridiculous. As did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a woman's arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash. It looked like the arm of a shop mannequin. The story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens: many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed. This also applies to the corny, hokey ending. The lead Pamela Franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent. Other than her performance, real slim pickings from the rest of the cast sans Welles. The direction and story were both done by Gordon who obviously had little gas left in the engine. This is not a good movie in any way under any name. Now, what is this review like?

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that had to change plans when money was withheld?, using the article: The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Sir Ernest Shackleton. In the article, it states that \\"Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic.\\" This shows that Sir Ernest Shackleton was the person who had to change plans when money was withheld."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Food that blows you away and makes you want to come back to Vegas just for a particular restaurant. They say it's glitz and glamour, expensive and flashy, and food takes a backseat. No where else is this more true than STK.   It's a great looking restaurant. It's hip with loud music and good looking servers and bartenders.

The carburetor, or 'carb', is an essential part of older vehicles which aren't equipped with modern fuel injection systems. The carburetor's role is to mix air and fuel in the perfect ratio for combustion. Poor performance, reduced fuel economy, and even failure to start can result from a faulty or ill-maintained carburetor. Therefore, understanding how to repair and maintain them is key to your vehicle's ongoing performance. Before delving into a comprehensive guide, it's important to remember that safety comes first when performing any repair or maintenance on your vehicle. Always start with a cool engine and disconnect the battery before starting. Here's a step by step guide to repairing and maintaining your carburetor: 1. **Proper Diagnosis**: The first step is to diagnose whether the carburetor is indeed defective or needs maintenance. Symptoms of carburetor problems include hard starting, poor fuel economy, lack of power, or black smoke from the exhaust.  2. **Removal**: If trouble with the carburetor is suspected, it must first be removed from the vehicle. This typically involves disconnecting the air cleaner, throttle linkage, fuel lines, and vacuum lines. Ensure to take note or photos to help remember the configuration of these connections for reinstallation. 3. **Disassembly**: Once removed, you can begin disassembling the carburetor. Depending on the make and model, this might differ slightly. Generally, the top and bottom halves are separated by removing the fasteners. Be careful not to lose any small parts. 4. **Cleaning**: This is a crucial step in carburetor maintenance. Over time, the carburetor can accumulate deposits which hinder its functionality. Use a carburetor cleaning solution and a small brush to clean out passages, jets, and other parts. A compressed air blowgun can be used to blow out passages and ensure there's no residual gunk. 5. **Inspection and replacement of parts if necessary**: Check the parts for wear or damage. You may need to replace certain parts, like gaskets, seals, or the needle valve. You can find carb rebuild kits available for most models which include all needed parts. 6. **Reassembly**: Carefully reassemble the carburetor, reversing the steps used to disassemble it. It's important to ensure all parts fit correctly and are in their proper place. 7. **Reinstallation**: Reinstall the carburetor into your vehicle, reconnecting all the linkages, lines, and the air cleaner. Always check the manufacturer's specifications for any settings or adjustments that need to be made after reinstallation. 8. **Tuning**: After everything's back together, and your engine's warmed up, you can then fine-tune the carburetor's settings to ensure your engine operates at peak efficiency. This usually involves adjusting the idle speed and mixture screws using a tachometer and vacuum gauge. To maintain your carburetor, here are a few tips: 1. **Regular Cleaning**: Regularly clean the carburetor to prevent the build-up of dirt and debris.  2. **Quality Fuel**: Using high-quality fuel can also aid in maintaining the health of your carburetor. 3. **Regular Inspection**: Regular inspection can help detect any potential issues and ensure the carburetor is functioning correctly. 4. **Tune-ups**: Regular tune-ups, in line with the manufacturer's recommendations, will help maintain optimal operation. Remember, every carburetor and vehicle are a little bit different, but this guide should provide you with a general understanding of how to repair and maintain a carburetor. Always refer to your vehicle's specific service manual for detailed instructions to supplement this guide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Editor's note: Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review. A former CNN producer/correspondent, she is the author of \\"The End of Revolution: A Changing World in the Age of Live Television.\\" Follow her on Twitter: @FridaGColumns (CNN) -- How much should the rest of the world worry about the crisis unfolding in Europe? For anyone who cares about the state of their personal finances and the size of their reserves for retirement, the answer is: A lot. For investors, it's a time of risk and opportunity. Investors exhaled with some relief Sunday after voters in Greece gave a narrow victory to New Democracy, a party that vows to work with European leaders to keep the struggling country in the eurozone. But the crisis is nowhere near solved. Greece has to find a way to stability while Spain and Italy, much more important economies, show worrisome signs. When scenarios of \\"Europocalyspe\\" and \\"Eurogeddon\\" are evoked, you know things are getting bad. Because in today's interdependent and hyper-connected world, no continent can feel secure while another is sliding economically. What happens in Europe has the potential to determine the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November. It could trip up America's feeble recovery, create more unemployment and take a toll on the global stock market. Conversely, if Europe manages to avoid a financial storm, it could remove a huge cloud of uncertainty hanging over the global economy and brighten the outlook -- and the portfolios -- of investors everywhere. Pro-Euro Greek right tries, again, to form government If you doubt that European problems could affect U.S. shores, take a quick glance at history for a chilling lesson. Prominent economists have drawn an eerie parallel between today's events and those of the early 1930s when, as the world limped in the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street crash, a banking crisis in Europe took the world economy into another downward spiral and led to an explosion of extremist politics that, ultimately, set the pathway to World War II. If you don't care about the politics, consider just the stock market in the last 100 years. The Dow Jones, which stood at 381 in summer 1929, lost about half its value in the first few months after the September 1929 crash. But the worst was yet to come. By 1932, the Dow plummeted to just 41, a breathtaking 90% loss. The years after the 1929 crash brought a stomach-churning roller-coaster ride. The Dow climbed more than 400% from 41 to 194 and then back down to 92, before stabilizing and resuming a relatively steady climb during World War II. Imagine seeing your savings, your retirement funds, cut to one-tenth their size. It took a quarter of a century for the market to return to pre-crash levels. Those who bought stocks when the index stood at 41 saw their investment eventually soar to spectacular heights -- especially those who picked the right stocks at the right time. (The tycoon, J. Paul Getty, among others, started building his fortune by snapping up bargain stocks.) So what do those events in the 1930s, which unfolded when bankers, politicians and investors knew so much less about the economy, have to do with our world, the age of the Internet, the era of unlimited access to information and advanced economic theories? If European leaders and the voters who elect them glean the right lessons from history and manage to steer their continent away from the edge of the cliff, then we won't see a repeat of that disaster of a global crash. But no one knows whether Europeans will get their economic problems straightened out. This means that anyone who owns stocks or other investments should take a deep breath and decide just how much risk he or she is willing to accept. Most Americans own stocks through mutual funds. Millions have their money in employee-provided retirement accounts and rely on the stock market for their future without realizing it. Many top-rated investors are minimizing their stake in the market. The legendary Jim Rogers says he's pessimistic and not buying stocks. He's buying gold and other commodities. The investment giant BlackRock is telling clients to stock up on cash and safe-haven bonds and treasury bonds even though this is not the best strategy in the long run since it provides negative returns when you factor in inflation. For the more adventurous and optimistic, there's the lure of potentially huge returns, if Europe dodges disaster, or, in the aftermath of a crash. European leaders are getting strong advice from all directions. While the Greeks suffer, the Spaniards face severe unemployment, and fringe political parties spring up and grow stronger, economists from both sides of the Atlantic are urging German Chancellor Angela Merkel to reverse course from her push for strict austerity, which is choking economies already in depression. My sense is that Merkel will do whatever it takes to not let the eurozone come apart and will ease up on austerity while the storm passes. But nobody has a crystal ball; not for the market, not for the politicians. For investors, the most important point to keep in mind is that these are not days like others. It is a time of crisis, of great risk and, as happens when there is great risk, also of potentially great rewards. Those who wish to take the risk should do it with eyes wide open, not by accident, neglect or inertia. The epicenter of the crisis may be in Europe, but the shockwaves will know no boundaries. Everyone should pay attention. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","output":"Title: Europe's Financial Turmoil: A Global Ripple Effect on Investors and Economies In this article, Frida Ghitis discusses how the ongoing European crisis can have significant consequences for investors and economies around the world. She highlights the importance of understanding the potential risks and opportunities that the European financial situation presents, especially for those focused on personal finances and retirement planning. Investors recently experienced a fleeting sense of relief after the Greek election results favored New Democracy, a party that supports European cooperation. However, Ghitis emphasizes that the European crisis is far from over. The challenges facing Greece, Spain, and Italy reveal concerning signs for the global economy. The financial turmoil in Europe threatens international stability due to the interconnected and hyper-connected nature of today's global economy. The article explores how Europe's economic situation could influence the U.S. presidential election, disrupt America's fragile recovery, increase unemployment rates, and impact worldwide stock markets. Conversely, resolving the European crisis could boost investor portfolios and the overall global economic outlook. Drawing parallels to the 1930s economic crisis that followed the 1929 Wall Street crash, the author explains how the current European crisis could have dire consequences if not handled correctly. As a result, investors must consider the level of risk that they are prepared to face in the current uncertain climate. Ghitis also points out that legendary investors like Jim Rogers are opting for investments in gold and other commodities as a measure of risk management. The article stresses that the outcome of the European financial crisis is uncertain and largely depends on the actions of European leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Ghitis suggests that Merkel may change her stance on austerity and ensure the eurozone remains intact, but there is no guarantee. With significant risks and potential rewards on the line, the author urges investors worldwide to remain vigilant, informed, and prepared for potential global repercussions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we will get rid of the constant term next to it. -8*k - 40 + 40 = 0 + 40 Adding 40 to both sides, we get: -8*k = 40 Step 3: Solve for k Now, we will solve for k by dividing both sides by the coefficient of k, which is -8: -8*k / -8 = 40 / -8 Cancelling the -8, we find the value of k: k = -5 So, the solution to the equation -16*k + 8*k - 40 = 0 for k is k = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cliff Richard stars as Jonnie, who works as a waiter on a traveling ferry with his bandmates (The Shadows) and his fellow waiter friends. Through a pyrotechnics accident, the power cuts on the ferry and the group are fired on the spot, stranded on a tiny boat with nothing but their instruments. They float around in the Mediterranean until they reach the Canary Islands, where they spot a young woman wearing tartan clothing, and they try to follow her, accidentally confusing her with a Scottish man wearing a kilt.

This crucial step initiates the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, which ultimately leads to the generation of energy necessary for plants to grow and reproduce. Here is a detailed explanation of the complete process, now including the missing initial step: 1. Absorption of sunlight: The process of photosynthesis begins when the plant's chlorophyll, a pigment found in chloroplasts within the plant cells, absorbs photons of light from the sun. These absorbed photons excite the electrons within the chlorophyll, increasing their energy levels and preparing them for use in subsequent reactions. 2. The energy from the sunlight causes an enzyme in the plant to break apart the water: Known as photolysis, this step sees the energy absorbed in the previous step being used to catalyze the splitting of water molecules (H2O) into their constituent components: oxygen (O2), hydrogen ions (H+), and electrons (e-). 3. The water breaks into oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons: As a result of photolysis, water molecules are broken down into their constituent components. Oxygen is produced as a byproduct, hydrogen ions are released, and electrons are liberated to participate in the following steps of photosynthesis. 4. Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into NADPH: The freed electrons and hydrogen ions are used to convert a molecule called NADP+ (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) into its reduced form, NADPH. NADPH plays a crucial role as an electron carrier in the subsequent light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, also known as the Calvin cycle. 5. Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis: The oxygen molecules generated during photolysis are not needed by the plant for the remaining steps of photosynthesis. Therefore, they diffuse out of the plant cells and are released into the atmosphere as a waste product. This release of oxygen is essential for life on Earth, as it provides the necessary gas for aerobic respiration in other organisms, including humans. In summary, the missing first step in the process is the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll in the plant, which is required to initiate the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis that ultimately generate energy and reduce NADP+ to NADPH."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the topic \\"Timing belt\\" whose answer would be: Timing belt (camshaft) , a toothed belt used to drive the camshaft(s) within an internal combustion engine.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles.

As day broke on Tuesday, four people were killed across Syria, opposition activists said. At least 144 people were reported killed Monday, including 64 who died in a \\"horrifying massacre\\" at a checkpoint in Homs province.      Those killed at a checkpoint in the Abel area were attempting to flee shelling in the Baba Amr neighborhood in the city of Homs, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists.      \\"Reports said security members and thugs kidnapped the women among them,\\" the network said in a statement. Residents found 47 corpses in one area and 17 in a second one, it said.      A total of 68 corpses were found in the area, in farmland in western Homs province, said the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, apparently referencing the same incident. The bodies were found after an injured survivor reported the attack, the group said. All the bodies had been either shot or stabbed.

President Bashar al-Assad's regime has touted the constitutional referendum as a move toward reform.      Syria announced the referendum amid intense international cries to stop the bloodshed and open its regime to change. But analysts and protesters widely describe the effort as a farce, a superficial attempt to pacify al-Assad's critics.      \\"We dismiss it as absolutely cynical. ...

But the vast majority of reports from the ground indicate that government forces are massacring citizens in an attempt to wipe out civilians seeking al-Assad's ouster.      No attempts at getting al-Assad to stop his regime's crackdown on dissidents have stopped the onslaught.      The Council of the European Union agreed Monday on new sanctions regarding Syria after foreign ministers met in Brussels, Belgium, said spokeswoman Susanne Kiefer.      Seven ministers of the al-Assad regime will have their EU assets frozen and will be denied entry into the EU, Kiefer said. In addition, assets of the Syrian Central Bank in the EU will be frozen. Legitimate trade will be allowed to continue, she said, but must be authorized first.      \\"Today's decisions will put further pressure on those who are responsible for the ruthless campaign of repression in Syria,\\" Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, said in a statement. \\"The measures target the regime and its ability to conduct the appalling violence against civilians. As long as the repression continues, the EU will keep imposing sanctions.\\"      Elsewhere in Syria on Monday, two people were killed and eight wounded by government shelling on the village of Sarmeen in Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.      The shelling began Sunday night, and Syrian troops have entered Sarmeen, said Abu Mustafa al-Sayed, a Syrian opposition and community leader in the town of Binnish, also in Idlib province. The Syrian army has Sarmeen surrounded, and communications with the residents have been cut off, he said.      And in Damascus, security forces fired on mourners at a funeral, according to the Local Coordination Committees. Clashes were also occurring in Deir Ezzor, the group said, and 14 students were arrested during a protest at Aleppo University.      The opposition network estimates that 9,000 people have been killed since the government launched its crackdown in March. The Syrian government says that more than 2,000 members of its security forces have been killed by \\"terrorists\\" during that same period.      Asked Monday whether Syria would be referred to the International Criminal Court, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said, \\"I hope the international community reflects on the conditions of referral. ... It's a difficult issue. Syria is not a participating state, so it's up to the Security Council to address this question. They must therefore continue to gather the elements that would permit an eventual referral.\\" ||||| BEIRUT, Lebanon — Determined to tightly control political change in Syria in the face of an insurrection, the government announced Monday that nearly 90 percent of voters had approved a new Constitution.      Western leaders and opponents of the government called the referendum a farce and its result a hoax, while Russia and China, two of Syria’s few remaining international friends, called it a step toward reform.      The news came as activists said that scores of people had been killed across the country in the government’s violent crackdown on the opposition and in clashes between rebels and security forces.      In a news conference broadcast on Syrian state television, Maj. Gen. Muhammad Ibrahim al-Shaar, the interior minister, said that 89.4 percent of voters, or nearly 7.5 million people, backed the new Constitution in the referendum on Sunday, while 735,000, or about 9 percent, voted against it. About 132,000 ballots, or 1.6 percent, were invalid, he said.      General Shaar called the 57.4 percent turnout of eligible voters a good showing, “despite the threats and intimidation by armed terrorist groups,” as the government refers to its opponents.      In Syria, referendums traditionally produce the results sought by the government, so the huge plurality reported in favor of the Constitution was not surprising.      “For its entire existence, this regime has forged elections,” said Haithem el-Maleh, a Syrian lawyer and human rights activist, speaking by telephone from Cairo. “How can they hold a referendum in the shadow of war and tanks?” he said. “Aren’t they embarrassed?” Mr. Maleh said the people, and not President Bashar al-Assad, should have chosen the committee that rewrote the Constitution.      With opponents of the government boycotting the voting, it was possible, some Syrians said, that the government did not need to manipulate the vote totals very much; most of the people who cast ballots may well have been genuine supporters of the government.      “From the people around me, most of those who didn’t like the Constitution didn’t bother going to the polling stations,” said Amir Bitar, 29, a Christian resident of Damascus who said he voted for the change. “So it is understandable that the vast majority of those who did vote turned out to be in favor of the Constitution.”      The biggest changes brought by the new Constitution include ending the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party’s political monopoly and setting a limit of two seven-year terms for future presidents.      Elsewhere in Syria, clashes continued Monday between the government and its opponents. Shells and rockets crashed onto the city of Homs, and activist groups said that more than 60 people were killed as they tried to flee besieged neighborhoods.      It was impossible to verify the activists’ reports, which differed on some specifics, because Western journalists are unable to operate freely in Syria.      One activist group based in Britain, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said that 68 bodies were brought to the hospital in Homs on Monday, The Associated Press reported. Another group, the Local Coordination Committees, put the death toll in Homs at 64 and said that 135 people had recently been killed across the country, though The A.P. said the period in which the people were killed was not clear.      The referendum widened the global diplomatic divide over how to deal with Syria. Russia and China castigated Syria’s critics for suggesting that Mr. Assad must go, and rejected American criticism of their own actions, while Western leaders sharpened their language against the Syrian government.      “The referendum vote has fooled nobody,” the British foreign secretary, William Hague, said in Brussels. European foreign ministers meeting there on Monday tightened economic sanctions against Syria, adding limits on transactions by Syria’s central bank, banning Syrian cargo flights to Europe and imposing travel restrictions on several senior officials.      “To open polling stations but continue to open fire on the civilians of the country has no credibility in the eyes of the world,” Mr. Hague said. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"In a place called Syria, the government had an election to approve a new constitution, which is a set of rules that guide the country. But, a lot of people are not happy about it. They think the election was not fair because the government is fighting against people that want change, making it hard for them to vote. There are also reports of people being hurt or killed while trying to escape from the dangerous areas.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person whose co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation?,, using the article: The Oklahoma City bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing happened at 9:02 am and killed at least 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed one-third of the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated 652 million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies in the wake of the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. Until the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States, and remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in the country's history. Within 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The full name of the person whose co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation is Timothy McVeigh.

Hollywood Undead is an American rap rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2005. They released their debut album, Swan Songs, on September 2, 2008, and their live CD/DVD Desperate Measures, on November 10, 2009. Their second studio album, American Tragedy, was released April 5, 2011. All of the band members use pseudonyms and wear their own unique mask, most of which are based on the common hockey goaltender design. In early 2010, the band announced that singer, Deuce, had left the band due to creative differences. Ragan and Busek later cited arguments over writing credits, and Deuce not wanting to tour, as reasons for the departure. Decker and Terrell also stated that Deuce wanting to bring his own personal assistant for touring caused a rift between members. The band asked long-time friend, and lead singer of Lorene Drive, Daniel Murillo, to fill in for Deuce's role. Murillo had just advanced past the auditions for season 9 of American Idol, but decided to drop out to join the band.  The band soon began writing material for their second studio album; American Tragedy, in mid-2010, with hopes to release it by the end of the year.

People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off.  Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds. Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn’t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn’t be bothered to find somewhere. (For the record, we both opted for a Big Mac and a diet coke.) For the first half day, we wandered around whilst the skies were beautifully blue… …learned a lot of local history, admired the Hollywood style sign in the hills… …slipped into a couple of churches (not to mention dodged giggling kids racing around on miniature cars)… …some hidden, and some hidden in plain sight… …and admired the sign from our cosy hotel, as it lit up at twilight Our only full day dawned fairly murky for the most part, it was a Sunday so a lot of things were closed, so after hitting 20,000 steps and getting lost a few times in the less pretty corners of the city… What does the blogger probably like to do while traveling to new cities?

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To answer these questions, I will need to conduct research on the role of media and education among Asian-Americans during the Great Depression from 1929-1941.  Step 1: Conduct research on the role of media among Asian-Americans during the Great Depression (1929-1941) I will start by searching for articles, research papers, and historical documents that provide information on how the media served Asian-Americans during the Great Depression. This will involve looking into newspapers, magazines or any other media sources that were available to Asian-Americans at that time. I will aim to learn how these media sources played a role in informing, educating, and connecting the Asian-American community. Step 2: Conduct research on the role of education among Asian-Americans during the Great Depression (1929-1941) Following the research on media, I will then look for materials that focus on education among Asian-Americans during the same period, such as school curriculums and access to education. I will search for articles and research papers on the educational opportunities and challenges faced by Asian-Americans during the Great Depression, as well as any existing educational reforms or initiatives that targeted Asian-Americans. Step 3: Determine if the two questions are the same After conducting research on both media and education among Asian-Americans during the Great Depression, I will compare the findings to determine if the two questions have similar answers or if they discuss separate aspects of the Asian-American experience during that time. Step 4: Present the findings and answer the questions Once I have completed my research and analysis, I will provide an answer to both questions, highlighting the role media and education played in the lives of Asian-Americans during the Great Depression, along with any similarities or differences in their impact. Based on the nature of the questions, I can say that they are not the same. The first question focuses on the role of media and its influence on Asian-Americans during the Great Depression, whereas the second question is concerned with the role of education during the same period. These are different aspects of the Asian-American experience during that time, and while there may be some overlap in terms of their impact on the lives of Asian-Americans, they are not interchangeable topics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilard, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. A secret German facility, apparently the largest of the Third Reich, covering 75 acres in an underground complex, was being re-excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development. The letter is believed to be \\"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first. As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the \\"race\\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \\"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\\" to initiate the Manhattan Project. It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II. For Einstein, \\"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \\"I made one great mistake in my life--when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification--the danger that the Germans would make them ...\\"  Question: \\"Which two powers during World War Two were likely racing to develop the first nuclear weapons?\\" Answer: \\"Switzerland\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, this answer is not correct.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Recently a large amount of factories have been built in Illinois using fossil fuels as their main energy source. In Indiana however, many of their factories have been shut down and replaced by parks with many plants and trees.  and a hint : When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.  Please answer this question : Given Illinois adds even more of these fossil fuel burning factories will the levels of carbon dioxide increase or decrease? A:","output":"Given the situation described, where Illinois is adding more fossil fuel burning factories, the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere will increase. This is due to a number of reasons explained by the carbon cycle and the impacts of fossil fuel consumption. Fossil fuels, which include coal, oil, and natural gas, store carbon that has been locked away for millions of years. When these fuels are extracted and burned as a source of energy for factories, they release CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. This disrupts the natural balance of the carbon cycle by injecting additional carbon dioxide that has not been part of the cycle for a long time. As your hint suggests, the burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a natural process through which plants absorb CO2, sunlight, and water to produce their food, releasing oxygen into the environment. However, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, are producing more carbon dioxide than the world's plants can absorb. Moreover, the situation in Indiana, where factories are being shut down and replaced by parks, is a positive development in terms of reducing carbon emissions. The addition of parks and trees will contribute to increased absorption of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, as well as create green spaces that offer numerous other environmental and public health benefits. However, if Illinois continues to construct factories relying on fossil fuels as their main energy source, the cumulative effect will be an overall increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere. This is because the emissions from the new factories will outweigh the benefits provided by the tree planting and greening efforts in Indiana. The increase in carbon dioxide emissions will exacerbate the greenhouse effect mentioned in the hint, which in turn contributes to global warming and climate change. Therefore, it is critical to focus on alternative, cleaner energy sources and reduce our dependency on fossil fuels to minimize the associated negative impacts on our environment and climate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 500 Hispanic settlers who had lived near Los Adaes had to relocate in 1773 in San Antonio . The 500 Hispanic settlers who had lived near Los Adaes had to resettle in San Antonio in 1773 .","output":"Yes, these two sentences convey the same meaning with a slight difference in the wording used. Both sentences are referring to the same event that took place in 1773, where 500 Hispanic settlers who had lived near Los Adaes were required to move and establish themselves in a new location, which in this case is San Antonio. In the first sentence, \\"relocate\\" is used to express the action of moving from one place to another. The structure of this sentence is also slightly different, as it places \\"in 1773\\" at the end of the sentence. However, the meaning remains the same - the settlers had to move in 1773. In the second sentence, \\"resettle\\" is employed to describe the same process of moving and establishing oneself in a different place. The sentence structure is also slightly different, with \\"in San Antonio\\" being followed by \\"in 1773,\\" which conveys the same information as the first sentence.

The Force Awakens Comic-Con footage: what we've learnt As predicted, the team behind Star Wars: the Force Awakens brought no new trailer to Comic-Con this year. But instead, writer/director JJ Abrams and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy presented a wonderful behind-the-scenes video, followed by a Q&A with their cast - young and old. Original Star Wars stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and - in a rare appearance - Harrison Ford were joined by new cast members Gwendonline Christie (who plays the first female stormtrooper), Girls star Adam Driver (playing the main villain), Brendan Gleeson (General Hux), plus heroes John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Oscar Isaac. Harrison Ford loved the script Making his first public appearance since being injured in a plane crash in March, the 72-year-old was on unusually good form at Comic-Con. In stark contrast to his open disdain for George Lucas’s original Star Wars script (“George, you can type this s___ but you can’t say it”), Ford professed to love Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan’s draft of The Force Awakens: “I never thought it would come back to bless me instead of haunt me,” he said. \\"I was very gratified when I read the script, because I read something that I thought was really remarkable. Well written, with some intriguing developments. So I was delighted to be involved.” The Force Awakens is basically finished Abrams revealed that a rough cut is now ready, and he’s preparing to show it to composer John Williams. And it's chock-full of practical effects Making good on his promise to favour practical effects over CGI wherever possible, Abrams brought out a creature called Baba Jo, one of “hundreds” of such beasts built for the film. It takes five people to operate Baba Jo. Brendon Gleeson let slip a secret Gleeson began answering a question with the words: “On Starkiller Base....” before cutting himself off, looking at Abrams and saying \\"Is that okay?\\" As one of the panelists later said, \\"You can't fire him now.\\" Gleeson also answered a question about his whether or not his character is evil: “He’s British, so yeah.” Adam Driver is very tight-lipped The Girls star, who plays villain Kylo Ren, didn’t let much slip at all. But he did reveal the following about his lightsaber-wielding character: “We didn’t really have a lot of conversations about bad or evil, actually, when we were shooting it. It was more what do you think the difference between being bad and being right?… Thinking they’re right is almost more evil. A group of people who have decided that they’re morally justified in behaving a certain way.” Simon Pegg is definitely in it somewhere After months of teasing and rumours, Pegg is clearly shown in the behind the scenes footage wearing some kind of alien costume. It seems what we’ve heard is true - he’s in the film but his face isn’t. “My life is now complete,\\" Pegg says in the video. Carrie Fisher does not have the Leia bun The video shows Fisher in costume as an older Leia for the first time, and her hair is in a single knot at the top of her head - not, alas, in the twin-bun style of old. The video throws up more questions than it answers Why is Daisy Ridley on the Millennium Falcon with Han Solo? Could she really be Han and Leia’s daughter? And is that really her piloting the ship in a long-range shot? What’s the significance of the red stripes on the Tie Fighters? Who’s the captive being lead through a corridor by a Stormtrooper? Why is the Stormtrooper wielding a flame-thrower? Who is Warwick Davies playing? Could the ewoks really be coming back? The first standalone movie is imminent Kennedy revealed that Gareth Edwards’s Star Wars: Rogue One, starring Felicity Jones, begins shooting in three weeks. But we still don’t know who’s shooting Episode 9 Despite the strong rumour flying around yesterday that Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow would be directing the last of the new trilogy (Looper’s Rian Johnson is doing Episode 8), no announcement was made at Comic-Con. Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens is released on December 18, 2015 What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316 workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000 engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production. The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built more than 800 Percival Proctor aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby Barton Aerodrome. Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for Churchill tanks, munitions, Bailey bridges, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce penicillin in quantity.As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of December 1940. On the night of 23 December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13 MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly. The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.In the December 1940 air raids, stray bombs aiming for Trafford Park landed on Old Trafford football stadium, the nearby home of Manchester United, but this air raid only resulted in minor damage and matches were soon being played at the stadium again. On 11 March 1941, however, stray bombs aimed at Trafford Park fell onto Old Trafford for a second time, causing serious damage to the stadium.

I need not trouble the reader with an account of the meeting with my faithful servant. While we were still engaged in questioning each other, I noticed that the countenance of our friend the scout wore an anxious and almost impatient expression.  \\"Anything wrong, Dobri?\\" I inquired.  \\"God knows!\\" he replied in a solemn tone, which impressed me much. \\"A rumour has come that the Circassians or the Bashi-Bazouks--I know not which, but both are fiends and cowards--have been to Venilik, and--\\"  He stopped abruptly.  \\"But that village was in the hands of the Russians,\\" I said, at once understanding his anxiety.  \\"It may be so, but I go to see without delay,\\" he replied, \\"and have only stopped thus long to know if you will go with me. These brutes kill and wound women and children as well as men. Perhaps your services may--Will you go?\\"  He spoke so earnestly, and his face looked so deadly pale, that I felt it impossible to refuse him. I was much exhausted by the prolonged labours of the day, but knew that I had reserve strength for an emergency.  \\"Give me a few minutes,\\" said I,--\\"just to get leave, you know. I can't go without leave.\\"  The scout nodded. In ten minutes I had returned. Meanwhile, Lancey had prepared my horse and his own. Swallowing a can of water, I vaulted into the saddle. It was very dark, but Petroff knew every foot of the country. For several hours we rode at a smart gallop, and then, as day was breaking, drew near to Venilik. As we approached, I observed that the bold countenance of the scout became almost pinched-looking from anxiety. Presently we observed smoke against the sky, and then saw that the village had undoubtedly been burned. I glanced at Petroff nervously. There was no longer a look of anxiety on his face, but a dark vindictive frown.  What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. Who asked the king to go with him? 2. Where were they going? 3. Who did Dobri hear had been to Venilik? 4. Who was supposed to be in control of the town? 5. What did Dobri say the brutes do? 6. And men? 7.

They have a unique and unlikely friendship with an 11-year-old African American girl, Kamilla. These three deal with hardships on a daily basis; Eli and Daniel face racism from African Americans and Hispanics, and Kamilla has a troubled family after the death of her mother some years earlier, who warn her to stay away from the shoe store. Kamilla is also constantly badgered by Mr. Kim, who owns a liquor store near Eli and Daniel's shoe store; this leads to Eli often intervening on Kamilla's behalf, straining the relationship between Mr. Kim and Eli.

The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return. Thus, the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania.  What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"One potential question that could be asked from this paragraph is: \\"What was the exact time and content of the conversation between the Vice President and the President regarding the shootdown authorization for the CAP pilots during the events of September 11?\\" This question addresses the uncertainty surrounding the precise moment and details of their conversation, considering the lack of documentary evidence and conflicting testimonies provided."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Information:  - In information theory , Shannon 's source coding theorem ( or noiseless coding theorem ) establishes the limits to possible data compression , and the operational meaning of the Shannon entropy . The source coding theorem shows that ( in the limit , as the length of a stream of independent and identically - distributed random variable ( i.i.d . ) data tends to infinity ) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate ( average number of bits per symbol ) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source , without it being virtually certain that information will be lost . However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy , with negligible probability of loss . The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word ( which is viewed as a random variable ) and of the size of the target alphabet .  - Ecology (from , \\"house\\", or \\"environment\\"; -, \\"study of\\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services.  - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968.  - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on  or to heat  the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.  - The Boltzmann constant (or ), which is named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant :  - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding.  - A temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer. Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called \\"centigrade\\"), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K).  - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon.  - Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humancomputer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation.  - In statistical thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol ) (Greek:,  + ) is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by certain macroscopic variables. Specifically, assuming that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (which provides consistency with the original thermodynamic concept of entropy discussed below, and gives entropy the dimension of energy divided by temperature). Formally,  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection.  - In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.  - Signal processing is an enabling technology that encompasses the fundamental theory, applications, algorithms, and implementations of processing or transferring information contained in many different physical, symbolic, or abstract formats broadly designated as \\"signals\\". It uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and linguistic representations, formalisms, and techniques for representation, modelling, analysis, synthesis, discovery, recovery, sensing, acquisition, extraction, learning, security, or forensics.  - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'named after' with 'claude shannon'.

I was a farm boy from County Kilkenny, a child who some thought would never walk, let alone go as far as I had in the world. From the day I was born, there was a problem. The doctors at the Dublin hospital told my parents I had phocomelia, a _ that affected both legs below the knee, which were outward and shorter than normal and each foot had just three toes. Life was tough. I couldn't stand, much less walk. I rarely, left the farmhouse---and then only in someone's arms. Mam bundled me up whenever she took me to town, no matter the season. \\"The world will see him when he can walk,\\" she told Dad. \\"And he will walk.\\" Mam devoted herself to helping me. She tried everything to get me on my feet. When I was three, she and Dad took me to a clinic in Dublin. A few weeks later we returned to Dublin with my artificial limbs  . Back home I practiced walking with my new limbs. \\"There's nothing anyone can do but you can't,\\" Mam said. \\"You and I are going to walk through town.\\" The next day Mam dressed me in my finest clothes. She wore a summer dress and fixed her hair and makeup. Dad drove us to the church. We stepped out of the car. Mam took my hand. \\"Hold your head up high, now, Ronan,\\" she said. We walked 300 meters to the post office. It was the farthest I'd walked, and I was sweating from the effort. Then we left the post office and continued down the street, Mam's eyes shining with a mother's pride. That night, back on our farm, I lay exhausted on my bed. It meant nothing, though, compared to what I'd done on my walk. Then I began to pursue my dream of singing. And at every step Mam's words came back to me--Ronan, you can do anything anyone else can do--and the faith she had in God, who would help me do it.

But many U.S. politicians are reluctant to deal with this issue.

Income inequality has been a growing issue in the United States for several decades, and the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen. The adoption of policies similar to those implemented in Brazil, such as cash transfer programs and minimum wage policies, could potentially help to address this problem by reallocating resources and supporting those in the lower income brackets. However, political reluctance and differing ideologies regarding wealth distribution have been major obstacles in implementing such policies to combat income inequality in the United States. It is important to recognize that a high level of income inequality can be detrimental to a nation's social cohesion, political stability, and economic growth. A more equal society fosters higher levels of trust and cooperation among citizens, which in turn can encourage stronger democratic institutions and overall well-being. Cash transfer programs, like Brazil's Bolsa Família, have proven effective in reducing inequality by providing direct financial assistance to low-income families, with certain requirements such as school attendance for children and adherence to vaccination schedules. This creates an incentive for families to invest in education and healthcare, which leads to better long-term outcomes for recipients and helps to break the cycle of poverty. Minimum wage policies also play a role in addressing income inequality by ensuring that workers earn a living wage that is sufficient to sustain them and their families, and are not exploited by employers. Brazil's decision to raise the minimum wage has contributed to a reduction in their income inequality and led to a growth in their middle class. If the United States were to adopt similar policies aimed at reducing income inequality, it could prevent the nation from becoming even more unequal than it currently is. However, this would require a collaborative effort among policymakers, politicians, and citizens to prioritize these issues and be willing to implement the necessary measures."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

A similar operation undertaken by their counterparts in Stockholm has just ended in failure. American college students Dana Polk (Kristen Connolly), Holden McCrea (Jesse Williams), Marty Mikalski (Fran Kranz), Jules Louden (Anna Hutchison), and Curt Vaughan (Chris Hemsworth) are spending their weekend at a seemingly deserted cabin in the forest, a cabin recently acquired by Vaughan's cousin. From their underground facility, where they possess significant technological control over the area in which the cabin is situated, Sitterson and Hadley manipulate the teenagers by intoxicating them with mind-altering drugs that hinder rational thinking and increase libido. They take bets from the different facility departments on what kind of monster will attack the teenagers and discuss the failures of similar rituals in other nations. In the cabin's cellar, the group finds many bizarre objects, including the diary of Patience Buckner, a cabin resident abused by her sadistic family. Dana recites incantations from the journal, inadvertently summoning the zombified Buckner family despite Mikalski's warnings.

Marty, a frequent marijuana smoker, discovers concealed surveillance equipment before being dragged off by one of the Buckners and apparently killed.

Article: Students at the Yale School of Architecture handed over the keys to a house that they designed and built to its new owners at a ceremony on Sept. 25 at 20 King Place. The ceremony held to hand over the house will mark the completion of the school's First-Year Building Project 2008. since 1967, the Yale School of Architecture has offered its first-year graduate students the opportunity to design and build a structure as a part of their education. Unique among architecture schools, this program is compulsory for all members of the class, and students frequently refer to it as their reason for applying to Yale. This year's class of 64 worked to design, develop and document an idea for a 2,100-square-foot, wheelchair-accessible, two-family house. Students had to use sustainable resources and energy-efficient technology. The budget for the project is always less than actual construction costs, and the builders-in-training had to seek supplementary donations, mostly in the form of construction materials. The result this year was a \\"designer\\" home, dressed entirely in cedar , fitted inside with Swedish-designed cabinetry  and partially powered by solar energy. The floors are bamboo, another natural material prized for being quickly replenished . This year, the student-builders used a pre-cast foundation system, which, in addition to its other labor-saving virtues, uses 75% less concrete than the poured system. The first-year class of 2008 raised 100,000-worth of donated materials. But when it came to constructing the inside steps of the house, they used old drafting tables from the School of Architecture that would otherwise have been thrown out.  Ground was broken in May for the house at King Place, and the whole class worked on site until the construction was finished. Question: How long did it take the students to finish the house ? Options: A: More than five months B: Almost five months C: About six months D: Less than four months The answer is:","output":"B: Almost five months Justification: The ground was broken in May and the ceremony was held on September 25th.

As the wealth has increased and people have acquired more material possessions, their outlook on life has become more positive and it has been noted that the citizens have a lower incidence of depression. The town of Zenphora, on the other hand, has taken a downward financial turn over the past 50 years. The citizens have had to sell their worldly goods just to make ends meet and many do not have a good feeling about what their future holds.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which town is more optimistic, Euphoria or Zenphora?  Hint: Using longitudinal data from over 100 countries, Diener and his colleagues showed that rich countries are in general happier than poor countries (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013).[17] Also, life satisfaction for most countries goes up as they become wealthier over time. Diener identified three factors that influence the relationship between income and SWB. Namely, rising income most likely results in higher SWB when it leads to greater optimism, financial satisfaction and household material prosperity among citizens. Furthermore, Diener and his colleagues investigated the relationship between income and different elements of SWB. They illustrated that income has stronger influence on people’s evaluation of their lives than the positive or negative emotions they experience over time (Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010).[18] The study points to the necessity to evaluate different elements of SWB separately instead of treating happiness as a single entity. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the question and supported by the research findings from Diener, Tay, & Oishi (2013) and Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora (2010), the town of Euphoria is more optimistic than the town of Zenphora. The town of Euphoria has experienced increased wealth and success, leading to an improved outlook on life for its citizens. This can be linked to the research conducted by Diener and his colleagues which indicate that, in general, richer countries tend to be happier than poorer countries. Furthermore, as countries grow wealthier, their citizens' life satisfaction tends to increase over time. The three factors that influence the relationship between income and subjective well-being (SWB), as identified by Diener, are greater optimism, financial satisfaction, and household material prosperity among citizens. In Euphoria, the citizens have acquired more material possessions, which can be assumed to contribute to their overall SWB, as well as resulting in a lower incidence of depression. On the other hand, the town of Zenphora has experienced financial difficulties over the past 50 years, leading to a decline in the citizens' well-being. They have had to sell their possessions in order to make ends meet, which indicates that they do not have the same level of financial satisfaction and household material prosperity as the citizens of Euphoria. This is likely to have a negative impact on their overall SWB. Additionally, the study by Diener and his colleagues highlights the importance of evaluating different elements of SWB separately, such as the influence of income on people's evaluations of their lives and their emotions over time. It has been found that income has a stronger effect on the way people evaluate their lives than on the positive or negative emotions they experience. From this perspective, it can be concluded that the town of Euphoria is more optimistic than Zenphora, as the higher income and material prosperity of the citizens likely have a positive impact on the evaluation of their lives. In conclusion, taking into account the financial situation and overall well-being of citizens in Euphoria and Zenphora, as well as the research findings on the relationship between income and SWB, it is clear that Euphoria is the more optimistic town of the two. The citizens of Euphoria have reaped the benefits of increased wealth, financial satisfaction, and household prosperity, leading to greater optimism and a positive outlook on life, while the citizens of Zenphora struggle with financial problems and an uncertain future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The benefits last at least a fortnight longer than the vacation and can be felt for months in some cases where it is claimed. Experts say workers should always take their full holiday entitlement each year-as many as one in three don't-to get the benefits.

The monks raise the child, and Marcelino grows into a rowdy young boy. He has been warned by the monks not to visit the monastery attic, where a supposed bogeyman lives, but he ventures upstairs anyway, sees the bogeyman and tears off back down the stairs. At a festival, Marcelino causes havoc when he accidentally lets some animals loose, and the new local mayor, a blacksmith whom the monks would not let adopt Marcelino because of his coarse behaviour, uses the incident as an excuse to try to shut down the monastery. Given the silent treatment by the monks, Marcelino gathers up the courage to once again enter the attic, where he sees not a bogeyman, but a beautiful statue of Christ on the Cross. Remarking that the statue looks hungry, Marcelino steals some bread and wine and offers it to the statue, which comes to life, descends from the Cross, and eats and drinks what the boy has brought him. The statue becomes Marcelino's best friend and confidant, and begins to give him religious instruction. For his part, Marcelino realizes that the statue is Christ. The monks know something is strange when they notice bread and wine disappearing, and arrange to spy on Marcelino.

Subjective idealists like George Berkeley are anti-realists in terms of a mind-independent world, whereas transcendental idealists like Immanuel Kant are strong skeptics of such a world, affirming epistemological and not metaphysical idealism. Thus Kant defines idealism as \\"the assertion that we can never be certain whether all of our putative outer experience is not mere imagining\\". He claimed that, according to idealism, \\"the reality of external objects does not admit of strict proof. On the contrary, however, the reality of the object of our internal sense (of myself and state) is clear immediately through consciousness.\\"  However, not all idealists restrict the real or the knowable to our immediate subjective experience. Objective idealists make claims about a transempirical world, but simply deny that this world is essentially divorced from or ontologically prior to the mental. Thus Plato and Gottfried Leibniz affirm an objective and knowable reality transcending our subjective awareness—a rejection of epistemological idealism—but propose that this reality is grounded in ideal entities, a form of metaphysical idealism. Nor do all metaphysical idealists agree on the nature of the ideal; for Plato, the fundamental entities were non-mental abstract forms, while for Leibniz they were proto-mental and concrete monads.

To do this, add 44h to both sides of the equation (to eliminate the -44h on the left side): -44h + 44h + 76 = 44h + 111h - 1164 0 + 76 = 155h - 1164 Now the equation is: 76 = 155h - 1164 Step 2: Move the constant term to the other side of the equation. To move the constant -1164 to the left side, add 1164 to both sides of the equation: 76 + 1164 = 155h - 1164 + 1164 1240 = 155h Step 3: Solve for h.

North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security...

Besides comprising the majority of the Y-DNA in Somalis, the E1b1b1a (formerly E3b1a) haplogroup also makes up a significant proportion of the paternal DNA of Ethiopians, Sudanese, Egyptians, Berbers, North African Arabs, as well as many Mediterranean populations.

During the process of erythropoiesis, the production of erythrocytes, precursor cells called proerythroblasts in the bone marrow go through successive stages of differentiation, leading to the formation of mature red blood cells (erythrocytes). An erythrocyte's main function is to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the body, which it does using the protein called hemoglobin. Throughout this differentiation process, the cells undergo a series of significant changes. These changes include: 1. Gradual decrease in cell size: As the cells mature, they become smaller in size. 2. Cytoplasmic condensation: The cytoplasm loses the ability to stain with basic dyes and becomes more eosinophilic, taking on a pinkish hue due to the accumulation of hemoglobin. 3. Extrusion of the nucleus: In the late stages of erythropoiesis, the cell extrudes its nucleus, which gets engulfed by cells called macrophages in the bone marrow. This extrusion allows the erythrocyte to have a more flexible, biconcave shape, which is essential for its ability to navigate through narrow capillaries and increase its surface area for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. 4. Loss of organelles: In addition to extruding the nucleus, the erythrocyte also loses most of its other organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria. This is a necessary step since removing these organelles creates more space for hemoglobin within the cell and reduces the cell's metabolic needs. As a consequence, mature erythrocytes generate energy solely through glycolysis, with lactic acid as the end product. In summary, as an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles (Option D) to create a more flexible and efficient cell for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport. The absence of these organelles also ensures that the mature red blood cell can focus its energy on its primary function without unnecessary metabolic demands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fleet Foxes is an American indie folk band formed in Seattle, Washington. Their first two albums were released by the Sub Pop and Bella Union record labels, with their third by Nonesuch and Bella Union. The band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP, Sun Giant, and their self-titled debut album. Both received much critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band 60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009-10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010.  In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound \\"less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based\\". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, saying, \\"That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record.\\" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with \\"vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling.\\" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments.  The album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, \\"Battery Kinzie\\", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe's radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track \\"Grown Ocean\\", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12\\" vinyl double A-side single of \\"Helplessness Blues\\" and \\"Grown Ocean\\" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for \\"The Shrine / An Argument\\".  On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band. He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage.  Helplessness Blues was nominated as Best Folk Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards, held February 12, 2012.

Answer this: When sound waves with large amplitude are compared to sound waves with small amplitude, which of the following is true? Select from the following. a). Sound waves with large amplitudes have less energy and sound quieter. b). Sound waves with large amplitudes have more energy and sound louder. c). Sound waves with large amplitudes have the same energy and sound quieter. d). Sound waves with large amplitudes have the same energy and sound louder.","output":"When comparing sound waves with large amplitude to sound waves with small amplitude, the truth is that sound waves with large amplitudes have more energy and sound louder. So, the correct answer is option b). Sound waves with large amplitudes have more energy and sound louder. Let's delve into this a bit more to understand why this is the case: Sound is a type of energy made by vibrations. When any object vibrates, it causes movement in the air particles. These particles bump into the particles close to them, which makes them vibrate too causing them to bump into more air particles. This is how sound is carried through air. Amplitude refers to the measure of the amount of energy in a sound wave. The amplitude of a sound wave determines its loudness or volume. A larger amplitude implies a louder sound, and a smaller amplitude means a quieter sound.  When a sound wave has more energy, it can cause larger vibrations in the eardrum which we perceive as a louder sound. This is because our hearing works by translating these physical vibrations into signals which the brain interprets as sound. The larger the vibrations, the louder our brain interprets the sound to be.  In terms of energy, a wave with a larger amplitude carries more energy. This is because amplitude is a reflection of the energy transported by the wave. The more energy a wave has, the higher its amplitude, and vice versa. Thus, sound waves with large amplitudes carry more energy and are inherently louder than sound waves with small amplitudes.  Therefore, the statement b) correctly relates the relationship between sound wave amplitude, energy, and the perceived loudness of the sound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? hate having to do this but there has been a lot of changes at Murphy's in the last year, none of which I can report as being good. This place used to be consistently great with service and food but I'm sad to say it's not anymore.   Began earlier this summer when the food started being hit or miss. Some days it was the stellar food we all came in to have at lunch and other days... not so good. To the point that the last three times were bad and the large group of us haven't gone back and probably won't. The food thing came down to if a certain chef was working - if he was there, good; if not, bad. Started asking the waitresses and figured out the trend.   Fast forward to today and that chef has left and no longer works there. Which leads me to understand why the last 3 times in a row the food has been subpar. Like what makes a tomato hard? wasn't green or unripe but hard like... tough to cut hard. wtf? I don't know enough to know this is a reason the food has got worse but typically if you're looking to franchise you get different food vendors that can deliver the same type of food to your locations all across the country. So think frozen foods instead of more fresh stuff etc. I mean it makes sense. Also when you have a trained Chef quit whom made great food, and tailored to groups that wanted more expensive off the menu lunches and catered for local businesses & events... something's up. I can only assume it was the quality in food and the new direction...   ... meaning... I also found out (chandler news and biz journal) that Murphy's is wanting to franchising and changing their name to Irish Republic and some of what's going on inside. Girls with slightly different garb... kilt's and knee-high's. etc. Not so much breastaraunt-ish but similar.  Trademark Info: http://www.trademarkia.com/irish-republic-public-house-85274024.html  Service... much like the food the service has gone down in quality. There never seems to be enough girls during what used to be the lunch rushes and an hour lunch quickly turns into 1:30 lunches waiting on fill-ups and food and the check. It's not horrible service, girls are nice and friendly, just slow.   In summary: We haven't returned in at least 4 weeks and it's just not an option when thinking of places to eat downtown Chandler anymore. From 5 to a 2 (meh i've experienced better).

Additionally, they note that they and their group haven't returned to the restaurant in weeks and that it is no longer an option when considering places to eat downtown.

Background: Pinhead is a fictional character from the Hellraiser series, first appearing as an unnamed figure in the Clive Barker novella The Hellbound Heart. The name \\"Pinhead\\" is derived from a sobriquet given to him by the crew of the first Hellraiser film; he is first credited as such in Hellbound: Hellraiser II. Nearly thirty years after The Hellbound Heart was published, the character was given the designations the Hell Priest and the Cold Man in the sequels that followed, The Scarlet Gospels and Hellraiser: The Toll. Pinhead is one of the leaders of the Cenobites, formerly humans but transformed into creatures which reside in an extradimensional realm, who travel to Earth through a puzzle box called the Lament Configuration in order to harvest human souls. Context: Described by Doug Bradley as stronger than Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, Pinhead is an extremely powerful being, and as such, has several supernatural abilities. His preferred method of attack is by summoning hooks and chains to mutilate victims, often pulling said victims in several directions to tear them apart. These chains are subject to his total mental control and he may direct them at will. The chains may even change shape after having attached to a victim. Pinhead is highly resistant to damage and direct assault, being able to resist both gunshots and futuristic energy weapons. His magic is also used for creating objects out of thin air, teleporting, creating explosions at distances and deceiving opponents with illusions. He is capable of creating other cenobites from both living and dead victims.  In order to act in the physical world, Pinhead needs to have been purposely summoned through the Lament Configuration, though this in itself is not usually enough for Pinhead to target the puzzle-solver: in Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Pinhead stops the Cenobites from torturing an emotionally traumatised girl who was manipulated as a proxy into opening the Configuration, remarking \\"...it is not hands that call us, it is desire.\\" In Hell on Earth, he temporarily eliminates these restraints when he is separated from the part of him that is Elliot Spencer, wreaking havoc indiscriminately upon every human subject he encounters until he is finally defeated when Spencer willingly merges with Pinhead once again, the combination binding Pinhead as Spencer keeps his extremes in check. During this incident his powers were apparently expanded beyond their normal limits allowing him to physically warp reality to his will.  Pinhead at first has no memory of his human past, though is reminded of it in Hellbound: Hellraiser II, which results in what screenwriter Peter Atkins described as him being \\"spiritually weakened\\" and subsequently killed by the Chanard Cenobite. Question: What are his powers? Answer:","output":"Pinhead possesses several supernatural abilities, which make him an extremely powerful being. Some of his powers include: 1. Summoning hooks and chains: Pinhead's preferred method of attack is by summoning hooks and chains to mutilate victims.

Shape-shifting chains: The chains may even change shape after having attached to a victim, providing Pinhead with a versatile means of attacking and torturing his victims. 3. High damage resistance: Pinhead is highly resistant to damage and direct assault, being able to resist both gunshots and futuristic energy weapons. 4. Magic and reality manipulation: His magic allows him to create objects out of thin air, teleport, create explosions at distances, and deceive opponents with illusions. In certain situations, his powers can be expanded, allowing him to physically warp reality to his will. 5. Cenobite creation: Pinhead is capable of creating other cenobites from both living and dead victims, adding to his arsenal of followers and minions. 6. Limited control in the physical world: Pinhead needs to be purposely summoned through the Lament Configuration to act in the physical world. However, his actions may be limited based on the desires of the person who summoned him. 7. Merging with his human past: Pinhead can merge with his human past (Elliot Spencer) to gain further control over his powers and bind his extreme tendencies. In summary, Pinhead's powers include summoning and controlling hooks and chains, shape-shifting, high resistance to damage, magic abilities such as creating objects, teleporting, and manipulating reality, cenobite creation, and acting with limited control in the physical world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Many of today's parents fondly remember childhood days spent playing outdoors. When children make mud pies and observe ants, it may seem like just fun and games, but the truth is the outdoor play is an important part of growing up healthily. The National Association for the Education of Young Children reports that outdoor play reduces (make...less) stress and restlessness in children and improves their attention. Outdoor play is the perfect way to fight against the childhood's obesity(being fat).Research shows that children who play outdoors are more fit and thin, according to the National Center for Physical Development and Outdoor Play. Children who spend time outside on a regular basis  also have healthier immune   systems. And playing outdoors is a good way to get enough vitamin D. Playing outside enables children to relax , reduces tension and helps them solve problems. When children play outdoors, they learn to share and cooperate (work together) with one another. Kids who feel confident outdoors are likely to become able clever adults. The outdoors is a giant laboratory for learning that improves creative thinking and problem solving. Researchers have found that children learn best when their body, mind and spirit are involved  , and this appears in outdoor play. Outside activities develop all five senses, which create a powerful learning environment. The outdoors also lets children have the chance to explore  , experiment, form questions and create their own ideas about how the world works. Although there are the many advantages of outdoor play, time spent outside has been reduced for many of today's children. Kids today spend much more time in front of electronic media than children a generation   ago. The lack of outdoor play is tied to the childhood widespread obesity. And experts predict that the situation is so serious that this generation will have much trouble when they grow up. To get kids involved with the outdoors, encourage them to collect rocks, fly kites, climb trees, garden, camp, swim, go fishing, watch birds and butterflies or play games with other children.

The other options are incorrect because: b). The information given already states that the same contractor is used for both phases, so there is no ambiguity. c). The statement confirms the same contractor is allowed for both phases, so this option contradicts the given information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Choose your answer from:  (A). negative;  (B). positive; TEXT:Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) gets out of reform school and goes back to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) does her best to keep him out of trouble, but it just seems to follow him. Aside from his associations with the Termite gang, Gabe is followed by real-life gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to collect the insurance. They need someone to blame for the arson, and Gabe is it. It is up to the Termites to work the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just desserts. The the scene that introduces the Dead End Kids is really quite good. The boys wander on over to the new resident's furniture on the street, and proceed to make it their own. They talk to each other in phoney posh accents and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Punsley takes a nap in a chair. The boys then proceed to start a fight with the new boy, but after he proves himself a good fighter, they ask him to join their club. The initiation scene is rather good too, filled with mischief that seems dangerous at first, but is really rather clever and innocent. Later, when Billy Halop studies to become the boy mayor, he has a dream about schoolwork. This is wonderfully staged, with tiny holograms of the kids walking on his face and firing questions at him. Angels Wash Their Faces is a great title because it plays off of the success of Angels With Dirty Faces, and really tells what the kids are doing. Notorious for bad behavior on and off the set, these boys make nice in this film. But rather than seem disingenuous, it makes for some great laughs. This is a preview of what many of the boys would become in The Bowery Boys series. We even get a few garbled words from Leo Gorcey.","output":"(B). positive"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],j={key:0},E={key:1};function D(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
