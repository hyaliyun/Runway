Can you fix that?","output":"The boat paints are just as usable as water under water. Certainly! Here's the corrected version with proper capitalization: The boat paints are just as usable as water underwater. To provide a more detailed explanation on this topic, let's discuss how boat paints have been specifically designed for underwater usage. Boat paints, also known as marine or antifouling paints, are specifically formulated to protect vessels from the harsh underwater environment. These paints need to withstand not only the constant pressure and motion of water but also the various microorganisms, algae, and other marine life that can attach themselves to the boat's hull.  There are several factors that contribute to the effectiveness of boat paints in underwater conditions: 1. Waterproof: Boat paints contain specialized resins and additives that create a highly waterproof barrier, preventing water infiltration and protecting the boat's surface from moisture damage. This is essential, given that the boat paint is always submerged in water. 2. Antifouling properties: One of the primary goals of boat paint is to prevent the growth of marine life on the boat's hull. Marine organisms can cause significant drag and negatively impact fuel efficiency and speed. Boat paints contain biocides like copper or other chemical compounds that deter marine organisms from attaching to the boat's surface. 3. Durability: Since vessels are exposed to harsh conditions both above and below water, boat paints must be durable, able to withstand constant impact from waves, UV exposure, and corrosive saltwater. Marine paints are formulated to provide long-lasting protection and maintain their integrity in these conditions. 4. Adhesion: A boat paint's ability to adhere to various substrates (fiberglass, wood, metal) and withstand the stress of flexing, twisting, and impacts is crucial for its underwater performance. High-quality marine paints contain strong adhesion properties that enable them to remain bonded to the boat's surface even in turbulent waters. 5. Compatibility: Marine paints need to be compatible with various boat materials, ensuring that they do not damage or cause issues with other components of the boat. For example, boat paints should not cause any adverse reactions with metals, plastics, or other materials used in the boat's construction. Overall, boat paints are made specifically for underwater usage, offering protection, durability, and performance in harsh marine conditions. Through their unique formulations and properties, marine paints provide exceptional underwater protection, ensuring that the vessel remains functional even when submerged in water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will Dwight finish his growth spurt before or after Jimothy?  Hint: Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished.","output":"Dwight will likely finish his growth spurt before Jimothy, as he is older and has a higher level of testosterone, which plays a significant role in controlling adolescent growth."},{"instruction":"Title: Wow, what junk Review: Four people couldn't figure out how this was supposed to stay together.

Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man â Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume â finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death.

As the ship sinks, Taylor finds Stewart dead and her body desiccated. They throw an inflatable raft from the ship and climb down into it; before departing the ship, Taylor notes that the date is November 25, 3978, approximately two millennia after their departure in 1972. Once ashore, Dodge performs a soil test and pronounces the soil incapable of sustaining life. After abandoning their raft, the astronauts set off through a desolate wasteland in hopes of finding food and water before their provisions run out. Eventually, they encounter plant life. They find an oasis at the edge of the desert and go swimming, ignoring eerie scarecrow-like figures around the edge of the water. While they are swimming, their clothes are stolen. Pursuing the thieves, the astronauts find their clothes torn to shreds, their supplies pillaged and the perpetrators â a group of humans that are apparently so primitive that they cannot even talk and dressed in torn clothes â raiding a cornfield. Taylor is attracted to one of the humans, whom he later names Nova (Linda Harrison).

Given the question: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything.

On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop.

Article: Humble hero uses Medal of Honor to raise awareness of the wounds of war      WASHINGTON — Ty Carter sat on the back of his camper, parked near a gas station in the remote Oregon woods, with his two dogs asleep and his kids arguing and his wife feeding the baby, waiting for a phone call he didn’t really want to take.      A colonel from the Pentagon had contacted him a week earlier, to ask whether he would be available that day for a call from a “high-ranking military official.”      Carter said no.      It would be in the middle of his family vacation — he had promised them a trip to Crater Lake.      “He sounded kind of exasperated, so I could tell that was the wrong answer,” Carter said, laughing. He agreed to take a detour, to stay within cell-phone range a few hours longer.      When the call came, it was the commander-in-chief, who congratulated Carter on being chosen for the Medal of Honor. Sitting on the back bumper as the occasional car sped by, the soldier thanked him, traded stories about raising children, then got back in the car to continue the drive south.      That’s how Army Staff Sgt. Ty Carter learned he’d be recognized as one of America’s greatest heroes.      Not from a lavish White House ceremony, which comes Monday. Not from a summons to the Pentagon, or even to his base commander’s office.      From a cell-phone call at a remote gas station — actually, across the street from the gas station because folks there were worried about him loitering so he had to move the camper.      Monday, Carter will become the fifth living Medal of Honor recipient for actions in Afghanistan. Only 12 men from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have been honored with the award, singled out for “conspicuous gallantry” and “selfless courage” on the battlefield.      The common thread between the survivors’ stories has been their humility, even compared to the proud-without-boasting heroes of the past. All of them said they were just doing their job, that any other servicemember would have done the same, that they aren’t inherently different than any other American who joined the military.      “I am an American soldier, just like thousands who have served, will serve and are continuing to serve this great nation,” he said at a news conference at his home base of Joint Base Lewis-McChord just days after the White House announcement. “This award is not mine alone.”      Carter, 33, has spent most of the last few weeks starkly recounting battlefield chaos to reporters while privately trying to explain what the battlefield was like to his 14-year-old son, Jayden. Madison, 8, was more interested in buying a new dress for the trip to Washington.      With the Medal of Honor effectively making him undeployable — recipients have said Pentagon leaders are reluctant to send them back into harm’s way — he wants to continue his service in wounded warrior units, sharing his struggles with post-traumatic stress.      He’s uncomfortable facing the families of the men who died fighting alongside him, freely admitting to a mix of guilt and post-traumatic stress whenever he speaks to them.      “We all did what we could to keep each other alive,” he said.      The battlefield      Carter is the second Medal of Honor recipient from the Battle of Kamdesh, one of the few fights in Afghanistan to catch the attention of the American public. Clint Romesha received his award earlier this year, for fighting done on the other side of the remote Army firebase.      On Oct. 3, 2009, more than 300 Taliban fighters descended on Combat Outpost Keating, a soon-to-be-abandoned site near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, in a well-coordinated ambush. Eight U.S. soldiers would be killed in the daylong battle, and 22 wounded.      When the fighting began — a hail of bullets from above, almost immediately overwhelming the 54-man force inside the COP — then-Spc. Carter was asleep. He rushed into battle wearing a tan T-shirt and PT shorts but did manage to grab his body armor.      He spent most of the day out of uniform, just trying to survive.      Carter and three others were pinned down around a sandbagged Humvee serving as a guard tower, dodging between cover as the enemy advanced.      He watched two friends die in the early assault and two more die trying to support his position. Another, Spc. Stephan Mace, was gravely wounded by a rocket-propelled grenade and left stranded in the middle of the kill zone.      Carter’s commanding sergeant forbade him from attempting rescue after the explosion, saying it was a suicide mission. Over the next agonizing hours, Carter watched Mace slowly dying just out of reach.      “A good man was lying there wounded, begging for my help,” he said, swallowing hard as he fought back tears. “But [Sgt. Brad] Larson knew that if I went out there, I’d be dead too. For that, I owe him my life.”      So the two men kept fighting. When they ran out of ammo, Carter scavenged magazines from a nearby bombed Humvee. When he and Larson saw Taliban fighters walking onto the COP, they worried the base was beyond saving.      Between bursts of gunfire, Carter said they discussed crawling down the nearby hillside, rolling into the river and floating down to the next Army base a few miles downstream. It was a bad escape plan, but possibly the only option.      Still, Carter was focused on Mace. As the firefight began to shift in their favor — thanks to the efforts of Romesha across the base and aerial support — Carter pressed Larson again to let him try to rescue Mace.      Larson relented.      Carter ran onto exposed ground to pull the almost lifeless Mace to safety. He had to make two trips — out to stabilize the fallen soldier, back to coordinate cover fire with Larson, out again to drag Mace across the kill zone back to relative safety.      On his next scavenging mission, Carter found a fallen comrade’s radio and managed to connect with the men across the COP. They set up an evacuation plan, got themselves out of the Humvee prison and took Mace to the medics.      “I had told myself long before that if I ended up in that kind of situation, I wouldn’t let fear make my choices for me,” Carter said. “All I thought about was supporting [our] men.”      Getting back to his squad wasn’t the end of the day for Carter. He spent the next few hours working as half of a sniper team, picking off enemies along the hillside. Later, when a tree caught on fire outside the medical station, Carter went out with full battle rattle and a chainsaw to keep the flames from spreading.      “It actually fell on the TOC (tactical operating station) and put out the fire on its roof, so that was good,” he said, smiling at the memory of his battlefield lumberjacking.      By then, the battle was mostly over. Mace and other wounded were evacuated. It wasn’t until a few hours later, while the remaining men were still recovering the bodies of their fallen friends, that they learned Mace died in surgery.      “I didn’t feel angry that we lost them,” Carter said. “I just felt the loss. I just felt sad.      “I don’t want to put down the Medal of Honor or what it means. But when you’ve lost family ...”      Carter still describes his actions largely as a failure, especially when reflecting on Mace’s death. Mace’s mother, Vanessa Adelson, disagrees.      “My son didn’t die in the dirt alone, because of what Ty did,” she told reporters last week. “After seeing another soldier get killed trying to rescue my son, Ty still went out there to save him.      “Because of what he did, Stephan had a few more hours with his brothers. He was able to speak with them (before he was evacuated). He was joking about getting a beer with the surgeons afterwards.      “Because of Ty’s actions, my son died thinking that he was coming home. He was at peace.”      The aftermath      Carter didn’t attend Romesha’s Medal of Honor ceremony, saying the 4-year-old battle still felt too raw for him. He talks about the nine losses his troop suffered in that battle — fellow soldier Ed Faulker Jr. battled PTSD and took his own life a year after the attack.      He has been open about his own struggles with PTSD, and said he hopes to use the new honor as a forum to talk about the stress of war and the stigma of seeking mental help. He deployed again to Afghanistan last year and has been in counseling to help him handle the battlefield horrors he can never unsee.      “America’s citizen soldiers are doing amazing things to make them proud,” he said. “But people need to be more aware of the wounds of combat, both the visual wounds and the unseen ones.”      That’s the man he wants people to see receiving the nation’s highest military honor: a U.S. soldier who did his job and is struggling with the aftermath.      He’s talked to fellow medal recipient Sgt. 1st Class Leroy Petry — who lost his hand hurling an enemy grenade away from wounded soldiers in Afghanistan — about how to direct the story away from himself and toward the larger sacrifices of servicemembers. He’s more comfortable talking about his struggles than his successes.      Army officials insist that Carter is more than just another soldier: His “remarkable acts of heroism and skill … exemplify what it means to be an American hero.”      His family sees the hero and the humble man. His wife, Shannon, told reporters earlier this month that recaps of his battlefield heroism are too overwhelming to process, but “he’s my husband … he blows my mind every day.”      She’ll accompany him into the East Room of the White House for today’s formal ceremony, likely trying to keep 8-month old daughter Sehara quiet while the commander-in-chief speaks. His parents will be there too, along soldiers from his Army unit and from past medal-worthy battles.      In an interview with Army media, Carter’s father, Mark, wept while talking about what it will mean to see his son honored by the president.      “Not too many dads get to experience this,” he said, “where their son or daughter survives and then gets recognized nationally for an act of being himself in a dire situation.”      shane.leo@stripes.com      Twitter: @LeoShane ||||| For more, watch \\"Jake Tapper Reports: An Unlikely Hero\\" tonight August 21 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. Jake Tapper, host of \\"The Lead\\" and CNN's chief Washington correspondent, is the author of the best-selling book, \\"The Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor.\\"      (CNN) -- When Spc.Ty Carter first arrived in Afghanistan, he took one look at his surroundings and thought, \\"This is a death trap.\\"      He would soon learn just how right he was.      Combat Outpost Keating was a sitting target for nearby Taliban insurgents: It sat deep within a valley, surrounded by mountains.      The American soldiers stationed there knew it was only a matter of time before something bad happened. \\"We just didn't know when,\\" Carter said.      When it did, the assault would set in motion a chaotic chain of events that had every soldier certain he would not make it out alive.      Eight American soldiers died on October 3, 2009. Many of the 45 others who survived, including Carter, struggle with the guilt that they couldn't save more lives.      Yet Carter's daring efforts to rescue his fellow soldiers in the face of imminent death earned him the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, which he will receive on Monday at a White House ceremony.      Now Staff Sgt. Ty Carter, 33, will join another survivor of that battle, former Army Staff Sgt. Clint Romesha, who received the award earlier this year. It marks the first time in nearly half a century that two living soldiers from the same battle received the Medal of Honor.      To Carter, it's a bittersweet award.      \\"It just brings back all those memories of what he had to go through,\\" explained his wife, Shannon Derby.      Discharged from the Marines      Carter was a loner as a teenager. He didn't have a lot of friends. His older brother Seth had a knack for getting into trouble, and Ty followed in his footsteps for awhile before his mother kicked Seth out of the house.      Not exactly hero material, he says.      Carter joined the Marines in 1998, spending five years in the service until a fight with a roommate led to his demotion. Two months later, he was honorably discharged.      So, it was back to civilian life, something that left Carter restless and bored. He bounced across the country from job to job: more than a dozen stints in five years, everything from a yacht repairman to a tow-truck operator.      He was supporting his daughter after his first marriage ended. But in every job, something was always missing.      \\"There was no motivation, there was no purpose,\\" Carter said. \\"It felt like I was a drone.\\"      He hated the punch-in-punch-out lifestyle of making ends meet, and fondly recalled military life.      \\"I was thinking 'Well man, back in the service ... I was doing what I enjoyed and I was actually happy to wake up in the morning, happy to go to work,'\\" he said.      So he enlisted in the Army in 2008. But military life wasn't the idyllic place he remembered.      \\"We had a platoon full of guys that were on a lighter side of life (who) liked to joke around,\\" retired Sgt. 1st Class Jonathan Hill recalled. \\"And Carter never really got involved ... he thought it was immature.      \\"Carter really didn't make friends with a lot of guys, and he struggled with it.\\"      A little over a year after he enlisted, Carter and his platoon were deployed to eastern Afghanistan in May 2009.      Despite his aloofness toward his fellow soldiers, Carter would find himself in a situation where he didn't think twice to risk his life for those men whose jokes he once found childish.      Defining moment      Combat Outpost Keating had been built in Nuristan province in 2006 as part of the effort by NATO-led forces to build partnerships with local Afghans, and try to stop insurgents from trickling over in nearby Pakistan.      The camp had experienced ups and downs since that time and by 2008, the cavalry commanders in charge of the outpost thought it made sense to shut it down.      Yet there were other factors at play.      Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai was in the middle of his re-election campaign in fall 2009, and abandoning Combat Outpost Keating might have been seen as a lack of American support.      So, despite numerous warnings, Gen. Stanley McChrystal -- then commander of all U.S. troops in Afghanistan -- kept the outpost open.      After Karzai's victory and the end of a military operation that freed some key assets, the military leadership approved a plan to abandon the outpost and the troops stationed there were to start packing up on October 4, 2009.      That never happened.      Instead, a day before their planned departure, an assault was unleashed on the outpost that culminated in what has now been described as one of the most intense battles of the entire war in Afghanistan.      The first shots rang out just a few minutes before 6 a.m. The rumors that the soldiers had heard for months were coming true. Carter said he had often imagined that day.      \\"I was like, 'Well, if it's my time to go, how am I going out?' \\" he said.      The Taliban had studied how the Americans responded to previous attacks, and they knew the outpost relied heavily on its mortars.      So they made the big guns their first target.      \\"When the enemy weren't shooting at us, they were shooting at the weapons,\\" Carter said. \\"So they were disabling the weapons.\\"      The insurgent fire killed Pfc. Kevin Thomson as he raced to his post. Sgt. Josh Kirk was killed while returning fire.      \\"You could hear the rounds coming in from every direction,\\" said platoon Sgt. Jon Hill.      Troops begin running much-needed ammunition to the men on guard duty. Sgt. Michael Scusa was gunned down 10 feet outside one of the outpost's doors. In the midst of the gunfire, Sgt. Christopher Griffin \\"immediately ran out the door without hesitation,\\" Hill said.      \\"He didn't make it back\\"      Ammunition was starting to run out, so Ty Carter and other members of his Black Knight troop volunteered to deliver more -- a hundred yards away across the heaviest of gunfire.      Carter didn't think twice about the danger. All he knew was there were three fellow soldiers -- Sgt. Bradley Larson, Spc. Stephan Mace and Sgt. Justin Gallegos -- trapped in a Humvee and they needed more supplies to return fire.      \\"Carter's kinda like .. for lack of a better word, a robot,\\" Hill said. \\"You tell him to do something, he's gonna do it and he's gonna do it to the best of his ability.\\"      He would return through that deadly gauntlet three times to get supplies to the men.      When the firefight was over, the death toll would include Mace, Gallegos, Sgt. Josh Hardt, and Staff Sgt. Vernon Martin.      The names of all eight men who died on that day are engraved on a steel band that Carter wears on his wrist, not that he needs the reminder.      Read more about the battle from Jake Tapper's \\"The Outpost\\"      Farm life      Today, Carter still struggles with the memories of the battle, seeking solace with his wife and three children on their farm in Washington state near Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where he is now stationed.      In the dark, quiet moments, the constant ringing in his head brings back difficult thoughts.      \\"That's when the memories start kicking in and you can't sleep because, you know, the whole, 'I shoulda done this, I coulda done that,' \\" he said. \\"And then you see the faces of the soldiers that died.\\"      Carter said he believes that one more name should be added to the death toll of the battle of Kamesh: Ed Faulkner Jr., who struggled with drug abuse and mental problems after surviving the battle.      He left the army with severe PTSD and died in September 2010 after a fatal overdose of methadone and Xanax. While there was no evidence of a suicide, Faulkner's friends -- including Carter -- believe his death was linked to the battle.      \\"I honestly believe that, yes, he was the ninth victim of Combat Outpost Keating,\\" Carter said. \\"And I also believe that he won't be the last.\\"      Carter also struggles with PTSD, and now has regular therapy.      \\"I didn't believe it was real until I experienced it,\\" he said of PTSD. \\"I thought it was just an excuse to get out of duty ... but once it hit me, and I realized it, I was blown away. How could I be so ignorant?\\"      Carter wants to be a voice to destigmatize these invisible wounds of war, and he hopes that the attention he receives with the Medal of Honor will show that there is nothing weak in seeking help.      \\"What we need to do is take the first few steps,\\" Carter said. \\"We need to realize that yes, this is affecting me, and I need to fix this.\\"      CNN's Eric Marrapodi, Jennifer Rizzo and Andy Segal contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","output":"Army Staff Sgt. Ty Carter was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Kamdesh in Afghanistan. His courage and selfless actions in rescuing his fellow soldiers in the face of imminent death has made him one of America's greatest heroes. Despite being seen as a humble and quiet person, Carter recounts the events of the battle and discusses his struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Upon receiving the Medal of Honor, he wants to use the recognition to raise awareness about the wounds of war, both visible and unseen, and advocate for mental health support for veterans. Carter is the second Medal of Honor recipient from the Battle of Kamdesh, joining Clint Romesha, who received his award earlier in the year. Carter's story highlights his struggles with PTSD, his openness about seeking help, and his desire to help others who are struggling, showing the reality many soldiers face in the aftermath of their service. He hopes that by sharing his story, people will see the nation's highest military honor being awarded to someone who isn't just a hero but is also struggling to deal with the effects of their experiences on the battlefield. Carter's focus on using his medal as a platform to raise awareness for the wounds of war directly appeals to the emotions of his audience, reinforcing his story of heroism and his ultimate message of hope for those facing similar struggles."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The March sisters tried to be good but had their share of faults. Pretty Meg was often displeased with the schoolchildren she taught; boyish Jo was easy to become angry; golden-haired schoolgirl Amy liked to show up; but Beth, who kept the house, was loving and gentle always. The happy days passed and darkness came when a telegram arrived for Mrs. March. \\"Your husband is very ill,\\" it said, \\"come at once.\\" The girl tried to be brave when their mother left for the front. They waited and prayed. Little Beth got scarlet fever   when she was taking care of the sick neighbor. She became very ill but began to recover by the time Marmee was back. When Father came home from the front and at that joyful Christmas dinner they were once more all together. Three years later the March girls had grown into young womanhood. Meg became Mrs. Brooke, and after a few family troubles got used to her new state happily. Jo had found pleasure in her literary efforts. Amy had grown into a young lady with a talent for design and an even greater one for society. But Beth had never fully regained her health, and her family watched her with love and anxiety. Amy was asked to go and stay in Europe with a relative of the Marches. Jo went to New York and became successful in her writing and had the satisfaction of seeing her work published there. But at home the bitterest blow was yet to fall. Beth had known for some time that she couldn't live much longer to be with the family and in the spring time she died. News came from Europe that Amy and Laurie, the grandson of a wealthy neighbor, had planned to be married soon.

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David.

The first post-Classical published classification of humans into distinct races seems to be François Bernier's Nouvelle division de la terre par les différents espèces ou races qui l'habitent (\\"New division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it\\"), published in 1684. In the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation. But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the White, European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes. The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus, inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human race Homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus, asiaticus, americanus, and afer, each associated with a different humour: sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic, respectively.

Furthermore, she found success as a radio personality in Australia, co-hosting a popular radio show from 2013 to 2014. To summarize, while Sophie Monk has had a successful and varied career in the entertainment industry, we cannot definitively conclude that she starred in a movie in 2007 based on the information provided. Further research may yield more information about her filmography during that time, but as it stands, there is no direct evidence pointing to a 2007 movie starring Sophie Monk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Two men named Ty and Vachel are hunting in a forest and come across an abandoned church, which they go in to explore. After Ty sees their truck being crashed into a tree, Vachel is stabbed with a serrated machete by a chuckling assailant who then dons Vachel's hat and jacket. Ty, seeing the murderer come out of the church, quietly flees off into the forest. Meanwhile, forest ranger Roy McLean is at his home, where he encounters a van of five college-aged adults heading to rural property which one of them has inherited. Despite his insistence that they not venture up the mountain, the five continue along. Among them are Warren; his girlfriend Constance; Jonathan, and his girlfriend, Megan; and Daniel, Jonathan's brother. On their way up the mountain, they hit a deer, and encounter Ty stumbling through the woods on his way down the mountain; they dismiss his warnings of \\"demons,\\" as he is visibly drunk. After reaching a point where the van cannot drive any further, the group set out on foot and make a campsite; at night, while around the fire, Constance, Megan, and Daniel hear noises around them and become frightened, only to find that Jonathan and Warren are playing a joke on them. The next morning, they hike along Silver Creek to a waterfall, where they see a young girl named Merry Cat Logan singing before noticing their presence and running into the woods. Megan and Jonathan go skinny dipping at the bottom of the falls, unaware that someone else has entered the water.

Question: Question: What is the biological purpose of eating breakfast? Options: - halitosis - fullness - overeating - gas - gain energy  Explain why a human would choose \\"gain energy\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"\\"Gain energy\\" is the most appropriate answer because breakfast is essentially an energy source. The human body requires energy to function optimally, including for physical activity and cognitive functioning. Breakfast literally means \\"breaking the fast\\" as it's the first meal you eat after several hours of sleep, essentially a long fast.  At night, while you sleep, your body is still operating and using up energy as the body's essential metabolic functions continue. By the time you wake up in the morning, the body's glucose levels usually drop which need to be replenished to 'jump start' the day.  Eating healthy food in the morning supplies your body with necessary nutrients and refuels your body's glucose levels which are vital for brain functionality and muscle operation. This is what gives the body energy to carry out activities throughout the day.  So, this is why a human would choose 'gain energy' to answer the question related to the biological purpose of eating breakfast. It refuels the body after a long period of fasting (sleep) and provides necessary energy for the day. None of the other options like 'halitosis', 'fullness', 'overeating' or 'gas' refer to the fundamental biological process connected to breakfast."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, you should not validate this answer as it does not accurately address the question asked. The question is about the annual income of Steve Jobs, but the suggested answer discusses his health issues and does not provide any information on his earnings.  To provide a more accurate and detailed response, let me clarify that Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, so he is no longer earning income. However, during his lifetime, his earnings varied depending on his different roles and involvement in various companies like Apple Inc. and Pixar Animation Studios. As co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc., Steve Jobs' annual salary was famously limited to 1 per year since 1997. However, this does not reflect his total compensation, as he also held substantial equity in the company in the form of stocks and stock options. At the time of his death, Jobs held 5.5 million shares of Apple stock and 138 million shares of Disney, which he gained from the acquisition of Pixar by Disney in 2006. The value of these shares and dividends generated significantly higher wealth for Jobs than his nominal annual salary. In summary, it would be more accurate to say that Steve Jobs' annual income varied during his lifetime and was mostly attributed to his stock ownership in Apple Inc. and Pixar/Disney, rather than his nominal salary of 1 per year."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: What would we do without humour? How would we enjoy speaking with others if we did not use humour to invite a smile or a laugh? And how would we manage in times when we feel sad and lonely?     Using humour we lighten up each day, and we find common ground with others. We build healthy relationships with others by knowing what to say and what to do. When our use of humour is successful, we build trust and cooperation. We discover that we are not alone, we learn to accept our mistakes, and we look for the good in others and in ourselves. Most importantly, we create common ground, as humour is an essential skill needed to communicate well with others. A few well-chosen words get the attention of others and make a serious point without their getting defensive  . Whether we prefer to be the centre of attention or to be shy and quiet, humour can be adjusted   to suit our personality.      However, when we lose our sense of humour, we often get critical or defensive, and we blame others or ourselves for what was said, and how it was said.      To ensure that our humour is welcomed by others, we need to combine our humour with speaking clearly and listening effectively.     Have you ever noticed that successful individuals often use self-depreciating humour to humble   themselves, without putting themselves down? These individuals understand that every person has strengths and weaknesses and that self-depreciating humour invites others to feel more confident and equal. In this way, humour is the shortest distance between two people.      Humour is the spice of life, as it brings happiness, numbs pain and it makes us speak and listen well.

While the app has its merits, it falls somewhat short of excellence, which is why I am awarding it three stars. Pros: 1. Comprehensive content: The app covers a wealth of information ranging from weapon trees, armor sets, quest details, and monster stats to skills, item locations, and even Palico support moves. For a hardcore Monster Hunter fan, the material is certainly appreciated and helps in strategizing against the game's numerous enemies. 2. Easy navigation: Finding information within the app is quite intuitive, with a simple menu layout that allows for speedy access to key sections. The search function is efficient and filters results based on user input, providing the most relevant data promptly. 3. Offline access: One of the highlights of the app is that it can be accessed offline, which is perfect during commutes or in areas with limited internet connectivity. It ensures that users can consult the guide anytime they need help. Cons: 1. Outdated and incomplete information: Although the app offers plenty of data, some crucial details are either missing or outdated. Several weapon trees and armor sets seem to be incomplete, and newer DLCs or game patches are not always accounted for in the database. This can lead to confusion and restrict gameplay progress, as players may rely on incorrect information. 2. Performance issues: The app suffers from occasional crashes, hangs, and slow loading times, which could prove irritating, especially in a time-sensitive gaming scenario. This seems to be an underlying issue that requires urgent attention. 3. Visual presentation: The overall design of the app can be improved. As it stands, the interface and images in the app appear dull and lacking in vibrancy. This, coupled with the occasional pixelation and low-resolution images, can make consulting the app less appealing than it could be. In conclusion, com.ghstudios.android.mhgendatabase does offer numerous benefits to its users, providing them with much-needed guidance in the complex and immersive world of Monster Hunter Generations. That being said, the app would benefit from improvements in its content quality, performance, and aesthetics to provide a seamless experience and maintain its relevancy in the ever-evolving gaming environment. A solid three-star app with the potential to be exceptional should these concerns be addressed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

However, according to a 2003 Amnesty International report, blacks and whites were the victims of murder in almost equal numbers, yet 80 percent of the people executed since 1977 were convicted of murders involving white victims. 13.5% of death row inmates are of Hispanic or Latino descent, while they make up 17.4% of the general population.

Colorado theater shooter James Holmes remains in a prison outside Colorado, after being transferred earlier this year.      A Colorado Department of Corrections spokeswoman said Thursday that state prison officials used the \\"interstate corrections compact\\" to move Holmes out of state.      \\"He is not in the state,\\" said Laurie Kilpatrick, a CDOC spokeswoman.      Kilpatrick would not say where Holmes was transferred, sometime before mid-January, citing safety concerns.      Holmes is serving a life without parole sentence for killing 12 people and injuring 70 others when he opened fire in a crowded Aurora movie theater in 2012.      Several victims testified during Holmes' sentencing that they didn't want him imprisoned in California, closer to his parents who live near San Diego.      More than 100 former Colorado prisoners are serving sentences out of state as part of the interstate compact, Kilpatrick said.      Kieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or @kierannicholson ||||| Ask any corrections officer: Guarding high-profile criminals is one of the most difficult parts of the job. Not because the most notorious are more dangerous than the rest, but because other inmates know that one way to get famous is to go after the infamous. Serial cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer found that out in a Wisconsin prison twenty years ago, and the con who beat him to death, Christopher Scarver, drew so much attention that he had to be transferred to Colorado.      As we first reported in September, Aurora theater shooter James Holmes was quietly shipped to the Colorado State Penitentiary after his sentencing without even his name surfacing in the Department of Corrections database, to begin serving his sentence of life without parole. But his presence there soon generated buzz among other inmates, in part because he was the only occupant of a sixteen-man pod, presumably for his own protection.      Yet even being isolated in his own unit within the state's highest-security prison wasn't enough to keep Holmes from being a target. On October 8, as he was leaving a case manager's office, Holmes was attacked by an inmate who'd slipped through a sliding door past a group being taken from a class to a day hall — a brief encounter that was announced by the attacker himself in a boastful letter to the Denver Post. But Mark \\"Slim\\" Daniels, a 27-year-old doing time for menacing, auto theft and other crimes, is concerned that people still don't understand his motives in assaulting Holmes. In a recent letter to Westword, he claims to have been acting as a kind of ad hoc avenger for the Aurora shootings. ||||| Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes was not supposed to interact with other prisoners, but after a security gate was left open at just the wrong time, another inmate snatched an opportunity to attack the mass killer in the state penitentiary, even throwing punches as guards tried to pull the two apart, according to documents and a top prison official who spoke exclusively to ABC News.      Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      Though officials insisted it was a minor incident, prison higher-ups said the episode proved Holmes was in so much jeopardy that he had to be secretly transferred out of state to an undisclosed location in what one critic called a highly unusual move.      “We had not allowed Holmes at that time to come into daily contact with other offenders,” Colorado Prisons Director Steve Hager said in an exclusive interview in February. “That was not part of the management plan of him.”      Hager explained that “the attack was part of the reason for moving him. There were many concerns; the attack was part of the concern.”      Colorado Dept. of Corrections      Hager said Holmes, 28, was not supposed to cross paths with anyone but prison staff while housed in the Colorado State Penitentiary in Canon City. But documents obtained by ABC News show that, as Holmes exited the office of his case manager on Oct. 8, a prison staffer opened a sliding gate without realizing he was putting Holmes in close proximity with another inmate, convicted car thief Mark “Slim” Daniels. The officer escorting Holmes was unable to radio the officer controlling the gate “as his battery had gone dead,” according to a so-called “intelligence assessment” drafted after the incident occurred.      With the sliding gate opened and Holmes within striking distance, Daniels, according to the reports, “ran through the slider, squeezing through as it was closing toward offender Holmes … Offender Daniels began hitting offender Holmes, in and around his head, with his fist.”      The documents paint a picture of a brief but frenzied incident with officers shouting “No. Don’t do it,” while “Daniels kept swinging over the top of [one officer’s] head, still hitting offender Holmes.” The officer escorting Holmes wrote that Daniels “landed at least two blows to offender Holmes before I was able to get behind” him.      Officers struggled to pull Daniels off Holmes but eventually got him to the ground. In the process, Daniels hit a female staffer \\"on the left side of her face below the eye and on the top of her head,” the records say.      In a letter to Denver's Westword newspaper in December, Daniels said he regretted not doing more harm to the mass murderer.      \\"I'm so sorry I couldn't wipe him out and sent [sic] him packing to Satan's lake of fire,” wrote Daniels, who is serving time for a series of crimes, including auto theft, menacing and forgery. “It was just impossible to do by myself with so many cops. I did get him six or seven good ones… He was very scared.”      Hager, the prisons director, agreed to answer questions after ABC News obtained internal records detailing the assault through a formal request from the Colorado Department of Corrections. Even as he acknowledged shortcomings at his facility, Hager insisted that staffers did not make any mistakes or violate department procedures or protocols. No one has been disciplined because of the assault, he said, and no one would be.      Glenn Asakawa/Denver Post via Getty Images      Despite Holmes’ infamy and the fact he had been housed at the prison more than five weeks, corrections staff still had not determined whether he would be kept in “protective custody” and separate from all other inmates at all times, Hager explained. But he was being held alone in the facility’s Management Control Unit. “At that time, they were trying to find the best placement for him,” Hager said.      Hager told ABC News that he did not review the closed-circuit video of the incident, though, he said, “I am sure that it has been monitored by the facility and the facility warden.” When ABC News requested copies of it, the state’s first assistant attorney general, James Quinn, offered a different response, saying “there are no stills and no video.”      When the assault occurred, it had been two full months since Holmes had been convicted on Aug. 7 for killing 12 and injuring 70 others when he shot up the Century Aurora 16 cinema in 2012. He was sentenced in late August to serve multiple life sentences behind bars.      After word got out that Daniels assaulted Holmes, strangers sent Daniels money and letters of support. Prison officials said his commissary account received 75 and someone was trying to “start a website called ‘James’ Jailhouse Justice.’” Daniels’ mother also established a GoFundMe site to help pay for bills Daniels’ family said are associated with the assault.      Because of the incident, Daniels was punished with 60 days in segregation, 45 days loss of privileges and up to 12 months in restrictive housing, Hager said. He has also been moved to Sterling Correctional Facility near the Nebraska border. He's eligible for parole in January.      But the most significant result of the incident was Holmes’ secret move to an undisclosed prison.      When asked about Holmes’ location, Corrections Department spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson first said it was public record, though she refused to answer the question. Jacobson later changed her explanation, saying the agreement that allows for the interstate transport of prisoners being held in state custody requires confidentiality. When pressed by ABC News to justify the new secrecy, Jacobson, Hager and other prison officials said the location is being kept a secret, citing only non-specific “security” needs of Holmes, other inmates and staffers.      Other states who participate in the interstate-prisoner system as well as the federal government routinely release information concerning the whereabouts of prisoners. For instance, the locations of the five accused of planning the 9/11 attacks and notorious California killer Charles Manson are public record.      Local District Attorney George Brauchler, who prosecuted Holmes, said he is disturbed that the killer is being hidden by Colorado authorities, regardless of what transpired inside the penitentiary.      “You can Google the federal inmate locator and look up any federal inmate you've ever heard of and find where they're located right at this moment,” Brauchler told ABC News. “Isn't that a tacit admission that the state system is less safe than the federal system? As a Colorado taxpayer and a Coloradoan who had to bear the impact of his mass murder, this guy should be serving a sentence in Colorado. And if not, we should know why and where he is.”      Bob Hood, a longtime corrections official who used to run the federal government’s highest-security prison, took issue with the explanations and actions of those in charge of Holmes and the Colorado prison system.      “It’s not debatable: Errors were made,” said Hood, a Colorado resident who used to be the warden of the federal Supermax penitentiary in Florence, Colo. “Clearly someone dropped the ball. [The inmates] should never have made contact. At a minimum, it’s a failure of systems -- a very serious breach of security.”      Hood said the assault was “simple” and should not have led to the extreme measure of Holmes being transferred to an undisclosed location.      “It’s called a ‘dump job,’” Hood said. “Moving him on to another warden. He’s always going to be a target. The [Colorado] Department of Corrections could easily have placed him in a secure setting. It’s ironic to me that they transfer him out of state for such a simple assault. The Department of Corrections dropped the ball. The inmate was assaulted. The system broke down.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Colorado theater shooter James Holmes, who was given a life sentence without parole for killing 12 people and injuring 70 others in the 2012 mass shooting, has been moved to a prison outside of Colorado.

In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years.

He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work.

Identify the key phrases and essential elements in each sentence. 2. Compare the key phrases and essential elements between the sentences. 3. Determine the similarity level based on the comparison. Step 1: Identify the key phrases and essential elements in each sentence. a. Sentence 1: \\"Palestinian President Receives Jordanian Foreign Minister\\" - Key phrase: \\"Palestinian President\\" - Essential element: \\"Receives\\" - Key phrase: \\"Jordanian Foreign Minister\\" b. Sentence 2: \\"Palestinian arrested for sexually harassing young girls\\" - Key phrase: \\"Palestinian\\" - Essential element: \\"arrested\\" - Key phrase: \\"sexually harassing young girls\\" Step 2: Compare the key phrases and essential elements between the sentences. - Both sentences contain the key phrase \\"Palestinian\\". This adds some similarity. - The essential elements in the sentences are different: \\"Receives\\" in sentence 1 while \\"arrested\\" in sentence 2. This decreases similarity. - The second key phrases are not related: \\"Jordanian Foreign Minister\\" in sentence 1 and \\"sexually harassing young girls\\" in sentence 2. This also decreases similarity. Step 3: Determine the similarity level based on the comparison. Based on the above comparison, the sentences have only one related key phrase (\\"Palestinian\\"), but the essential elements and the second key phrases are different.

Question: Information:  - The Territory of Minnesota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1849, until May 11, 1858, when the eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Minnesota.  - Bloomington is the fourth largest city in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is located in Hennepin County on the north bank of the Minnesota River, above its confluence with the Mississippi River. Bloomington lies south of downtown Minneapolis. The city's population is 86,435, according to the 2015 United States Census estimates.  - The Minnesota Golden Gophers football program represents the University of Minnesota in college football at the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level. Founded in 1882, the program is one of the oldest in college football. Minnesota has been a member of the Big Ten Conference since its inception in 1896 as the Western Conference. The Golden Gophers claim seven national championships: 1904, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1940, 1941, and 1960. Since 2009, the Gophers have played all their home games at TCF Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In January 2017, the Gophers fired head coach Tracy Claeys and hired former Western Michigan head coach PJ Fleck as the new head coach.  - Target Field is a baseball park located in downtown Minneapolis. It is the home ballpark of the Minnesota Twins, the state's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. It is the franchise's sixth ballpark and third in Minnesota. The Twins moved to Target Field for the 2010 Major League Baseball season after 28 seasons at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. It is the first facility built specifically for the Twins since the team moved to the Twin Cities in 1961; Metropolitan Stadium was built for the Minneapolis Millers five years before the franchise's first season in Minnesota, and the Metrodome was built as a multipurpose stadium for the Twins, Minnesota Vikings, and the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football team. The 2010 season was the first since 1936 in which the franchise (then known as the Washington Senators) did not share their home stadium with an NFL team. The Twins received the certificate of occupancy from Mortenson Construction on December 22, 2009. The Twins staff moved in on January 4, 2010.  - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs.  - The Minnesota Kicks were a professional soccer team that played at Metropolitan Stadium in the Minneapolis suburbs of Bloomington, Minnesota from 1976 to 1981. The team was a member of the now defunct North American Soccer League. The Minnesota Kicks were established in 1976 and quickly became one of the league's more popular teams, with an average attendance of 23,120 fans per game in 1976. The Kicks won their division four years in a row from 197679. The Kicks drew over 23,000 fans in each season from 197679, with attendance peaking at 32,775 in 1977.  - Metropolitan Stadium (often referred to as \\"the Met\\", \\"the Ice Palace\\" when the Minnesota Vikings played, \\"Met Stadium\\", or now \\"the Old Met\\" to distinguish from the Metrodome) was a sports stadium that once stood in Bloomington, Minnesota, just outside Minneapolis. The Minneapolis Millers minor league baseball team played at Met Stadium from 1956 to 1960. The Minnesota Twins and the Minnesota Vikings then played at the \\"Met\\" from 1961 to 1981. The North American Soccer League soccer team Minnesota Kicks also played there from 1976 to 1981.  - The Minnesota Twins are a Major League Baseball ( MLB ) team based in Minneapolis , Minnesota .

In the 19th century a different Minneapolis Millers were part of the Western League. The team played first in Athletic Park and later Nicollet Park.  The name Minneapolis Millers has been associated with a variety of professional minor league teams. The original Millers date back to 1884 when the Northwestern League was formed. This league failed and the Western League replaced it, absorbing some of the old teams. According to Stew Thornley, this team folded in 1891 due to financial problems. In 1894, another team calling itself the Millers was formed when Ban Johnson and Charles Comiskey revived the Western League in hopes of making it a second major league. The Millers continued to play in the Western League through 1900, when the name was changed to the American League to give it more of a national image. Following the 1900 season, several cities were abandoned for bigger markets in cities recently vacated by the National League, including Minneapolis. Some teams were transferred, as was the case of the Kansas City franchise to become the Washington Nationals (Senators). However, some of the teams were just left out in the dark. It is unclear which of these two paths the Millers took, but most evidence seems to point toward abandonment, not a transfer to Baltimore, especially given that no player for the 1900 Millers played for the 1901 Orioles.  - The Minnesota Vikings are an American football team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Vikings joined the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team in 1960, and first took the field for the 1961 season. The team competes in the National Football Conference (NFC) North division; before that, the Vikings were in the NFC Central, and before that they were in the NFL's Western Conference Central Division. The team has played in four Super Bowl games, but lost each one. The team plays its home games at U.S. Bank Stadium in the Downtown East section of Minneapolis.  - The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome (commonly called the Metrodome) was a domed sports stadium located in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. It opened in 1982 as a replacement for Metropolitan Stadium, the former home of the National Football League's (NFL) Minnesota Vikings and Major League Baseball's (MLB) Minnesota Twins, and Memorial Stadium, the former home of the Minnesota Golden Gophers football and baseball teams.  - Minnesota (locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  - Minneapolis is the county seat of Hennepin County, and larger of the Twin Cities, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, containing about 3.5 million residents. As of 2015, Minneapolis is the largest city in the state of Minnesota and 46th-largest in the United States with a population of 410,939. Minneapolis and Saint Paul anchor the second-largest economic center in the Midwest, after Chicago.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\").  - A bus (archaically also omnibus, multibus, motorbus, autobus) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type of bus is the single-decker rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special licence above and beyond a regular driver's licence.  - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC.  - The 2010 Major League Baseball season began Sunday, April 4, when the Boston Red Sox defeated their longtime rivals, the 2009 World Series champion New York Yankees at Fenway Park, 97; the regular season ended on October 3. The 2010 All-Star Game was played on July 13 at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California. The National League ended a 13-game winless streak with a 31 victory. Due to this result, the 2010 World Series began October 27 in the city of the National League Champion, the San Francisco Giants, and ended November 1 when the Giants defeated the American League Champion Texas Rangers in the 2010 World Series, four games to one.

Choose the correct option: In this case, it is best to choose the option of giving the spare ribs a gentle rinse under cold water. Rinsing with boiling water may cook the surface of the ribs, which is not the intention at this stage of the process. Cold water is more suitable for rinsing raw meat, as it helps to maintain its freshness and retains its texture. 2. Prepare the workspace: Clear the sink area and clean the surroundings to ensure a hygienic space for rinsing the spare ribs. Keep a cutting board within reach to place the rinsed ribs onto. 3. Handle ribs with clean hands: Ensure your hands are clean by washing them with warm water and soap before handling the spare ribs. This will minimize the risk of contaminating the meat with harmful bacteria. 4. Rinse the spare ribs under cold water: Hold the spare ribs under the cold tap, allowing the water to flow gently over the meat to rinse away any debris or impurities. Turn the ribs as needed to ensure that all sides are properly rinsed. 5. Pat the ribs dry: Once the ribs have been rinsed, gently pat them dry with paper towels. This will remove any excess water and help the ribs to cook evenly during the recipe process. 6. Transfer the ribs to a cutting board: Place the spare ribs onto a clean cutting board, ready to be used in the recipe. Make sure to sanitize the working area once the rinsing process is completed, to minimize any risk of cross-contamination.

Question: What rpm was more common than 16 2/3? Context: Some recordings, such as books for the blind, were pressed at 16 2⁄3 rpm. Prestige Records released jazz records in this format in the late 1950s; for example, two of their Miles Davis albums were paired together in this format. Peter Goldmark, the man who developed the 33 1⁄3 rpm record, developed the Highway Hi-Fi 16 2⁄3 rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles, but poor performance of the system and weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the 16 2⁄3 rpm records. Subsequently, the 16 2⁄3 rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially available, although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16 rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s.

The second the credits started rolling at the end of “Steve Jobs,” I reached into my purse and did what so many other people in the theater did: I turned on my iPhone. Currently, I’m writing this review on my MacBook Pro. Later this afternoon, once I’ve brought my six-year-old son home from school, I’ll try to deflect his demands to play “Angry Birds Star Wars” on the iPad. So yes, Steve Jobs has changed my life just as he’s changed many millions of others’ on the planet. The devices he devised do what he hoped they would do: They make our lives easier. They are aesthetically appealing. They are our friends.      Advertisement      Danny Boyle’s thrilling film, which takes place behind the scenes at three key product launches during the late Jobs’ career, begins with the Apple co-founder freaking out minutes before introducing the Macintosh in 1984 because his team couldn’t get it to say “hello.” It was nitpicky and obsessive—qualities he was famous for—but he was also onto something, as we now know: this idea of technology serving as a constant and comforting companion.      All of which makes the fact that he was so coldly dismissive to the real-life people closest to him—the people who actually loved him—such a fascinating contradiction, one of many that Boyle, writer Aaron Sorkin and star Michael Fassbender explore with great ambition and élan.      He insisted on micromanaging the tiniest details of his presentations—making sure the console was a perfect black cube, down to the millimeter, at the 1988 launch of his failed company, NeXT, or cajoling underlings to ignore fire code by shutting off the exit signs in the theater in hopes of achieving a dramatic darkness for his unveilings. But he couldn’t control who was going to come at him in the moments before he took the stage, or what they would say, or what they would want, or how they would dare to invade his formidable brain to wreak havoc when all he wanted to do was maintain his carefully crafted façade of Zen cool.      They include Apple co-founder and old friend Steve Wozniak (played with great intelligence and pathos by Seth Rogen); Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), the one-time father figure who would gain infamy for eventually firing Jobs; and Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston), Jobs’ ex-girlfriend and the mother of his daughter, Lisa, whom he long refused to acknowledge as his or support financially. (All three actresses playing Lisa at various ages give smart, distinctive performances, by the way—Makenzie Moss at 5, Ripley Sobo at 9 and Perla Haney-Jardine at 19.)      Advertisement      And of course, there is Fassbender himself, who doesn’t really resemble Jobs in any physical way but rather embodies his drive, his restlessness. Fassbender has never shied away from playing damaged or difficult characters—“Shame,” “12 Years a Slave,” even the “X-Men” prequels as a young Magneto—but here, he has the added challenge of playing a revered, real-life figure over the span of 14 years, from long hair and bow tie to glasses and dad jeans. He never flinches from the arrogant and repulsive elements of this man’s behavior, but there’s an intensity to his presence and a directness in his eyes that make him not just compelling but commanding. He doesn’t care whether you like him, and that’s exciting.      Through it all is Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs’ calm yet forceful right-hand woman and a much-needed voice of reason. Winslet gets a couple of great speeches, which she delivers with convincing power, totally unsurprisingly. Her exchanges with Fassbender are the film’s high points and almost a high-wire act; it’s a tricky thing making such dense dialogue sound effortless, but both actors pull it off.      This a super-Sorkiny Aaron Sorkin script—full of the kind of well-timed zingers and clever turns of phrase that never occur to us in real life. Rogen gets the best line of all toward the end, one he levels at Jobs in a crowded auditorium before the 1998 iMac launch: “You can be decent and gifted at the same time. It’s not binary.” With self-conscious beauty and piercing insight, it’s a notion that defines the entire film.      The energy is relentless and the actors all more than meet the challenge of not only keeping up with Sorkin’s trademark, rat-a-tat patter but also making it sing. But because the movie takes place almost entirely within interiors, the non-stop walking-and-talking—back and forth through hallways, up and down stairways and in and out of doorways—almost plays like a parody of Sorkin’s style, the kind of thing we saw when “The West Wing” was at its peak.      Thanks to Boyle’s typically kinetic direction, “Steve Jobs” is certainly never boring. It rarely takes a breath and is crammed with high-tech jargon, but it never feels bogged down. Corridors come to life with imagery. Moments from the past crosscut seamlessly and inform the present, often with overlapping dialogue. And the glare of the lights and thunder of the crowds can be so all encompassing, they make you feel like you were there, too: on the precipice of the future.      Advertisement      And that’s sort of a fascinating contradiction in itself: that a movie about a guy who was obsessed with sleekness and simplicity should be bursting with verbiage and verve.      Having said that, if you don’t know a whole lot about Steve Jobs going into “Steve Jobs,” “Steve Jobs” isn’t about to go out of its way to help you. If you don’t know about the garage in Los Altos, CA where it all began, or his lengthy and tangled friendship with Wozniak, the potential for exploring the complexities of Jobs’ personality might be lost on you. An excellent companion piece would be Alex Gibney’s recent documentary, “Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine,” which covers much of the same ground, but more thoroughly. (You’re welcome to ignore the 2013 biopic “Jobs” starring Ashton Kutcher, if you haven’t already. But it is rather telling that Jobs’ life has inspired three separate features in just a couple of years.)      Sorkin’s script is bold in choosing these pivotal moments in Jobs’ career and structuring them as a three-act play. Certainly it’s far preferable to the standard, superficial, cradle-to-the-grave biopic that tries to encompass too much. It’s easy to imagine “Steve Jobs” as a stage production, actually, for its theatrical talkiness and the minimalism of its set design.      It’s also easy to compare Sorkin’s portrayal of Jobs in “Steve Jobs” to his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in “The Social Network,” which earned him the adapted-screenplay Oscar in 2011. Both men are visionary geniuses who revolutionized the way people connect with each other, even though they are more than a little socially challenged when it comes to the people in their own lives. The irony may be too rich, but it’s delicious—even though the men in question can be so vicious that their actions leave a bad taste in your mouth.      The fact that he doesn’t try to redeem these flawed, fascinating figures—or even try to make you like them in the slightest way—feels like an innovation in itself. ||||| If you're going to interpret on film the searching mind of an indisputable genius, it helps not to make too many dumbass moves. On that basis, score a triumph for Steve Jobs, written, directed and acted to perfection, and so fresh and startling in conception and execution that it leaves you awed. Michael Fassbender rips through the role of the volcanic Apple co-founder and CEO who sucked at personal interaction but soared at transmogrifying personal computing and everything digital from music, animation (Pixar) and publishing to those iPhones we wear like a second skin. Fassbender's Jobs is a tornado of roaring ferocity and repressed feeling. He's also charming and seductively funny, which makes him dangerous if you get too close. Fassbender gives a towering performance of savage wit and limitless firepower. Is he really that good? Hell, yeah.      Related 'Steve Jobs' and Why Movies Can't Capture Genius How the biopic on Apple cofounder is the latest film that fails to nail the elusive quality — and why it may not matter      The script, by Aaron Sorkin, an Oscar winner for The Social Network, is sheer brilliance. Sorkin didn't so much follow Walter Isaacson's bestselling Jobs biography as absorb it into his DNA and release it with a daring structure and point of view all his own. Sorkin divides the movie into three time frames, each filmed in different formats by the gifted cinematographer Alwin Küchler and each involving the launch of a new Jobs product.      The first part, shot on low-res 16mm film, is set in 1984 in Cupertino, California, where Jobs, 29, debuts the Macintosh. The second part, presented on widescreen 35mm, unfurls at the sleek San Francisco Opera House in 1988 when Jobs, axed by Apple, presents his NeXT cube to mass indifference. The final part, utilizing high-def digital, takes place in 1998 at San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall, where Jobs, back calling the shots at Apple, gives the iMac its famed send-off. Dazed by the tech-speak and whirling innovations? Sorkin offers no sympathy. Echoing Jobs' rush to the next big thing, Sorkin counts on you to keep up. It's a challenge worth taking.      Cheers to master filmmaker Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting, 127 Hours) for directing Sorkin's three-act play with the hurtling speed of a white-knuckle thriller. Boyle also knows how to fill the spaces between words so they reveal the emotions of the multitudes who come and go in Jobs' hectic life. Sorkin moves characters around his cinematic chessboard (shades of Birdman) with little regard to whether they were actually present during Jobs' backstage rampages. Still, their actions and reactions have the ring of harsh, abstract truth.      The actors could not be better, as they thrust and parry over 14 years with the man who compares himself to Julius Caesar, an emperor surrounded by enemies. A superb Seth Rogen finds the bruised heart in Steve \\"Woz\\" Wozniak, the Apple co-founder who can't laugh off Jobs' refusal to credit his team with the success of the Apple II computer. Michael Stuhlbarg shows us the pain in software developer Andy Hertzfeld, who suffers the wrath of Jobs for failing to make the Mac prototype say \\"hello.\\" And Jeff Daniels, an iconic Sorkin interpreter on HBO's The Newsroom, nails every nuance as John Sculley, the Apple CEO who fires Jobs and sparks his cruel revenge.      Can anyone tame this perfectionist beast? Polish-born marketing chief Joanna Hoffman comes close. As played by the glorious Kate Winslet, award-caliber and radiating grit and grace, Hoffman is the one person ready to give shit to the boss. She berates Moneybags for letting his former lover Chrisann Brennan (Katherine Waterston) live on welfare and for denying paternity of their five-year-old daughter, Lisa (Makenzie Moss). Nine-year-old Lisa (Ripley Sobo) gets closer to the old man. But it's not until 19-year-old Lisa (a stellar Perla Haney-Jardine) fights her controlling, withholding dad on his terms that Jobs takes his first real steps toward her.

But Fassbender lets us see flickers of humanity. What we don't see is the older, even richer Jobs who married Laurene Powell, had three children, created more Apple miracles, fought the pancreatic cancer eating away at his body and died in 2011 at age 56.      Steve Jobs the movie aims to catch the man at three public points when people who defined their lives in relation to his showed up at the last minute to give him holy hell. Harsh? Yes. But essential to a film about a pioneer who created products with a slick, spotless veneer to hide all the tangled circuits inside. In Steve Jobs, sure to rank with the year's very best films, we see the circuits without ever diminishing the renegade whose vision is still changing our digital lives. ||||| I don’t know how much the tormented, loquacious, obsessive-compulsive dad played by Michael Fassbender in writer Aaron Sorkin and director Danny Boyle’s riveting three-act backstage drama “Steve Jobs” resembles the actual co-founder of Apple, the guy who made technology feel like an extension of the human personality rather than its antiseptic antidote. I also don’t know how much that matters. Not to draw an invidious comparison right off the bat, but how much did Shakespeare’s “Henry V” have to do with the historical monarch who fought the battle of Agincourt?      This film and Alex Gibney’s highly critical but richly nuanced recent documentary “Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine” barely seem to be about the same person, and brush against each other in only the most cursory ways. But the Boyle-Sorkin “Steve Jobs” is not a hagiography or a whitewashing. In fact, it’s not a biopic at all. Although I found Fassbender’s performance magnetic – the Irish actor gradually becomes Jobs, through some mysterious metamorphosis, despite looking almost nothing like him – the character we see backstage before three major product launches is frequently downright unpleasant and almost never resembles the sympathetic and “relatable” protagonist typically demanded by major motion pictures. If you find Steve Jobs relatable, you may need professional help.      Just as “The Social Network” was not about Facebook, “Moneyball” was not about the Oakland Athletics and “The West Wing” was not about the White House, “Steve Jobs” is not really about Steve Jobs or Apple Computer. Like nearly all of Sorkin’s work in movies and television, it’s about the moral interaction between public performance and private behavior, and about the difficulty many driven and talented people have in treating other human beings as if they mattered. Quite likely it’s a self-portrait to some degree, although there I lapse into exactly the kind of amateur psychoanalysis that Sorkin will cheerfully tell you he indulges in every time he sits down to write.      A few nights ago I moderated a conversation with Sorkin after a screening for the Writers Guild. Before laying out his psychological theory on Jobs – which is essentially that he was a profoundly damaged person who gradually came to understand how damaged he was – Sorkin hauled out a quip he has used many times before. “When I say stuff like this, you need to remember that I do hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in musical theater,” he said. “So this isn’t just coming from some guy off the street.”      But that gag line contains buried meanings that are not superficial: Sorkin’s writing is always theatrical, and in this screenplay he has essentially boiled down Walter Isaacson’s whopping Jobs biography into a trilogy of one-act plays. And his language is inherently musical: The famous Sorkin “walk and talk,” the overly lyrical expository monologue in which a character reveals his or her driving desires, the zinger comeback uttered while leaving a room, the finely balanced back and forth between a man and a woman. If anything, “Steve Jobs” is so perfectly wrought and meticulously shaped a vessel that it leaves all verisimilitude behind and delivers a dramatic redemption or salvation that Steve Jobs never found in life. For most viewers, that won’t be a problem, and this is simultaneously Sorkin’s most satisfying movie script and Boyle’s most graceful work as a director      Many fans of Apple and Jobs were puzzled to learn that Sorkin had taken just three incidents from Isaacson’s authorized biography – three of Jobs’ product launches, yes, but none of the greatest hits. This movie ends in 1998, with Jobs’ return to Apple and the launch of the iMac, the friendly ovoid blob that came in many colors and was described by Jobs’ daughter Lisa (in the movie, at least) as “Judy Jetson’s Easy-Bake Oven.” There is no such thing as an iPhone, still less an iPad, and people who want to listen to music while they walk around have those clunky portable CD players. In one of his final scenes with Lisa, Jobs tells her he’s going to fix that problem, which is probably a bit of Sorkin-esque cheating – the iPod was not launched for another three years.      But the structure of “Steve Jobs” makes perfect sense once you understand that Sorkin is essentially not interested in the story of Steve Jobs as a technological innovator or a corporate visionary. He’s looking for moments of dramatic tension and personal crisis in a famous person’s life, and is entirely willing to fictionalize them for effect, as was done in, say, the lives of the saints written by church historians centuries after their deaths. The moral spine of all three episodes in “Steve Jobs” is not Jobs’ relationship to his machines, but his relationships with a “West Wing”-style core group of people around him and especially with Lisa, the illegitimate daughter whom he denied for years and resisted getting to know.      In the first act of the film, it’s 1984 and Jobs is preparing to unveil the Macintosh desktop computer at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California – then a relatively obscure Silicon Valley bedroom community, and now famous all over the world as Apple’s hometown. The second chapter takes place four years later at the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, after Jobs has been hounded out of Apple and is preparing to launch the NeXT, an overpriced, overdesigned and underpowered cube that was effectively a Trojan horse directed at his former company. Then we skip a full decade, to Jobs’ reconquest of Apple and the iMac launch at Davies Symphony Hall, just across the street. (All the locations are genuine, and it really does make a difference.)      Boyle’s design team doesn’t go over the top with the ‘80s and ‘90s styles and signatures – although we certainly see oversize glasses and enormous shoulder pads – but each section of the film has a distinctive visual flavor. For the opening section, in 1984, cinematographer Alwin H. Küchler uses old-school 16mm film, lending the scene a subtle grain and slightly washed-out colors. In 1988, we get the richness and sophisticated color palette of 35mm, and for the late ‘90s Küchler switches to the relentless digital clarity and “contemporary” feeling of the Arri Alexa.      There’s a problem with the computer Jobs plans to unveil at the Flint Center: It doesn’t work. At least it doesn’t say “hello,” or not without a little backstage trickery, and Jobs is utterly inflexible on this point. (That part, Sorkin says, is actually true.) As for the Apple founder, who is about to risk his wunderkind reputation on a machine that will be a disastrous failure, he doesn’t want to say hello either. Not to the eager journalists, not to the technical wizards he alternately berates and patronizes – Seth Rogen plays Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and Michael Stuhlbarg is software genius Andy Hertzfeld – and not to his ex-girlfriend, Chrisanne Brennan (Katherine Waterston) or the little girl he insists is not his daughter. Chrisanne and Woz and Hertzfeld come and go throughout the movie, as each is subjected to Jobs’ baleful glare, and for obvious reasons Lisa is played by a different young actress in each section.      Jobs’ confidante and antagonist and external voice of conscience, throughout all three episodes, is Apple marketing head Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), constantly trying to make the angel-on-shoulder argument that he would still be Steve Jobs even if he stopped treating other people with vicious disregard. If Fassbender is almost never off screen – there are two brief shots where he is not visible – Winslet is present only slightly less, and turns what could have been an overly “womanly” amanuensis role into a steely, angry and ultimately irresistible force of ferocious power and emotion. If there’s an Oscar in this cast, beyond the one for which Fassbender will surely be nominated, it’s hers.      Another voice of normalcy from the outside world is supplied by Jeff Daniels as Apple CEO John Sculley, whose role here is largely a Sorkin invention. In real life, Sculley’s famous falling out with Jobs after the Macintosh fiasco of ’84 led first to the latter’s dismissal from Apple and then to the former’s, and the two men never spoke again. Sorkin says he had a lengthy email exchange with Sculley, who is now retired in Florida and has never spoken publicly about his days at Apple, and decided to give him a chance, in dramatic form, to say all the things he wanted to say to Steve Jobs but never did.      I’m perfectly fine with that decision, largely because any chance to watch Daniels act is a chance worth taking, and because Sorkin’s concocted confrontations between Jobs and Sculley are richly enjoyable. But it exemplifies the fact that “Steve Jobs” is a work of imagination and reinvention, not of biography or history. It’s a moral survey of American life on the cutting edge of the late 20th century as we wish it had happened (during the administration of President Jed Bartlet, in effect), rather than as it did. It’s a moving and magnificently crafted story about a person named Steve Jobs who was brought low by pride and arrogance and then redeemed by love. It might be a story that mirrors our dreams and desires, which is what the real Steve Jobs did too, and in that sense maybe it’s indirectly about him. It’s definitely not about a guy who built and sold computers.      “Steve Jobs” opens this week in New York and Los Angeles, with wider national release to follow, beginning Oct. 23. ||||| \\"Steve Jobs,\\" the man and the film, use Hoffman as a gatekeeper, someone who has a key voice in who gets to see the great man.

Wait and let gravity work: If the clog isn't too severe, sometimes waiting for a few minutes will allow the water to drain down the pipe, loosening the clog. If this doesn't work, proceed to the next step. 2. Use hot (but not boiling) water: Boil a kettle or pot of water and allow it to cool down for a few minutes, so it's hot but not boiling. Pour the hot water carefully into the toilet bowl, aiming at the drain hole to avoid splashing. The heat from the water can help break apart the clog and facilitate the unclogging process. 3. Use dish soap or shampoo: If the hot water isn't enough, add a generous squirt (approx. half a cup) of dish soap or shampoo into the toilet bowl. The soap will act as a lubricant, helping the clog to slide down the pipe. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes. 4. Use a wire coat hanger: If the clog is still not resolved, you can use a wire coat hanger as a makeshift snake. Unwind the hanger and bend one end so it forms a small hook. Carefully insert the hooked end into the drain hole and use a gentle probing motion to break up the clog. Be cautious not to apply excessive force, as this may damage your toilet. 5. Use a toilet brush or mop: If the coat hanger isn't available or doesn't help, use a toilet brush or wrap a mop head with a plastic bag, securing it with a rubber band. Push the brush or mop into the toilet bowl, aiming for the drain hole. Pump it gently to create pressure that may dislodge the clog. 6. Use baking soda and vinegar: If all else fails, combine one cup of baking soda with one cup of vinegar and pour the mixture into the toilet bowl. The chemical reaction between the baking soda and vinegar may help dissolve the clog. Leave it for 30 minutes, then pour another bucket of hot water into the toilet bowl to flush it and see if the clog has resolved. If the clog persists after trying these methods, it might be a more severe blockage that requires professional assistance from a plumber."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was inspired to write a song by the growing tension among the Beatles, using the article: Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout. The..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer would be: McCartney. Paul McCartney was the person who was inspired to write the song \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" due to the growing tension among the Beatles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There is no real fight scenes that's worth talking about, it's more or less something you'd see in the streets. Oh yeah I'll say this Dennis Hooper had some very funny moments. The reason i gave it two stars was because I keep hoping there will be another one that can be better than the last. I will say this, it's the worst of the series. Ed didn't look believable unless he was suppose to played a drag queen. They need to get a better makeup artist. I wish they call me, I'd have a better idea on a storyline for the movie. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is primarily negative. The reviewer only mentions a few positive aspects, such as Mr. Chong's performance and some funny moments from Dennis Hooper. However, the overall tone is critical, with the reviewer stating that there are no real fight scenes worth mentioning, the movie is the worst in the series, and the makeup is unconvincing. Additionally, the reviewer only gives the movie two stars and hopes that future installments will be better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I will consider all the vocabulary, grammar rules, and linguistic nuances between these two languages. Now, let's translate: \\"Science and Technology: Bulgaria hosts Informatics Olympiad\\" translates to \\"Bilim ve Teknoloji: Bulgaristan, Bilgisayar Olimpiyatları'na ev sahipliği yapıyor\\"  Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Science and Technology\\" translates to \\"Bilim ve Teknoloji\\". Both are common terms used in the tech field and do not possess any context-specific connotations, making the translation straightforward. 2. The \\":\\" in English is a punctuation used to introduce a sentence, or a list of things, or a quote, or a speech. In Turkish, the function of \\":\\" is the same as in English. 3. \\"Bulgaria hosts\\" translates to \\"Bulgaristan, ... ev sahipliği yapıyor\\". Here, the verb comes after the object in the Turkish sentence structure which is different from the English one. 4. \\"Informatics Olympiad\\" translates to \\"Bilgisayar Olimpiyatları\\". Olympiads in the field of informatics are also denoted as \\"Bilgisayar Olimpiyatları\\" in Turkish.

This article: Balch Creek begins in the Forest Park neighborhood in unincorporated Multnomah County near the intersection of Northwest Skyline Boulevard and Northwest Thompson Road at the crest of the West Hills. It flows generally east about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) to its confluence with the Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia River. The creek drops from 1,116 feet (340 m) above sea level at its source to 46 feet (14 m) at its mouth, a total of 1,070 feet (330 m). Most of this occurs in the first 2.5 miles (4.0 km). In the hills, the stream gradient (slope) generally ranges from 15 to 30 percent interspersed with sections of less than 15 percent along the middle reaches.From its source, the creek runs east on private property near Forest Park, a large municipal park in Portland, before turning briefly south about 3 miles (5 km) from the mouth. Soon thereafter, the stream receives an unnamed tributary on the right bank and turns southeast on private property along Northwest Cornell Road. It enters the city and the Audubon Society of Portland simultaneously about 2 miles (3 km) from the mouth, receives two more unnamed tributaries on the right, and flows northeast, entering the part of Forest Park known as Macleay Park.For about 0.25 miles (0.40 km) the creek parallels Wildwood Trail, the main hiking trail in Forest Park, until reaching a former public restroom known as the Stone House. From here Balch Creek runs beside the Lower Macleay Trail, another hiking trail, for about 0.8 miles (1.3 km). Near Northwest Thurman Street, roughly 1 mile (1.6 km) from the mouth, the creek flows through a trash rack into an 84-inch (210 cm) diameter storm sewer. City workers first diverted the creek into a pipe in the early 20th century. The water empties into the Willamette River in the city's Northwest Industrial neighborhood at Outfall 17. About 10 miles (16 km) below this outfall, the Willamette enters the Columbia River. contains an answer for the question: Which body of water flows past the Stone House?, what is it ?

Much of her work was published in The New Age under a variety of pseudonyms , and she lived with the editor , A. R. Orage , for a time before the outbreak of the First World War . Bisexual , she was a friend and lover of Katherine Mansfield , whose work was first published in The New Age . Another of her lovers was Wyndham Lewis . Born in London and raised in South Africa , just before the war , she moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with Max Jacob . She shared an apartment in Montparnasse with Amedeo Modigliani and posed for him as well . Another friend was adventure novelist Charles Beadle , with whom she had several things in common . He grew up in Hackney , spent time in South Africa ( participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police ) , and published several novels about bohemian life in Paris . When Beadle came to America , from Paris , in November 1916 , he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris . Towards the end of her life she felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due , and blamed Orage , whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain , and she published a pamphlet , The Old New Age , bitterly criticising him in 1936 . In 1943 , probably suffering from cancer , she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker .  - Philip Mairet (full name: Philippe Auguste Mairet; 18861975) was a designer, writer and journalist. He had a wide range of interest: crafts, Alfred Adler and psychiatry, and Social Credit. He was also a translator of major figures including Sartre. He wrote biographies of Sir Patrick Geddes and A. R. Orage, with both of whom he was closely associated.  - The New Age was a British literary magazine, noted for its wide influence under the editorship of A. R. Orage from 1907 to 1922. It began life in 1894 as a publication of the Christian Socialist movement; but in 1907 as a radical weekly edited by Joseph Clayton, it was struggling. In May of that year, Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson, who had been running the Leeds Arts Club, took over the journal with financial help from George Bernard Shaw. Jackson acted as co-editor only for the first year, after which Orage edited it alone until he sold it in 1922. By that time his interests had moved towards mysticism, and the quality and circulation of the journal had declined. According to a Brown University press release, \\"\\"The New Age\\" helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922\\". It ceased publication in 1938. Orage was also associated with \\"The New English Weekly\\" (193249) as editor during its first two years of operation (Philip Mairet took over at his death in 1934).  - Kathleen Mansfield Murry (nee Beauchamp; 14 October 1888  9 January 1923) was a prominent New Zealand modernist short story writer who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield. At 19, Mansfield left New Zealand and settled in the United Kingdom, where she became a friend of modernist writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf. In 1917 she was diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which led to her death at the age of 34.  - George Holbrook Jackson (31 December 1874  16 June 1948) was a British journalist, writer and publisher. He was recognised as one of the leading bibliophiles of his time.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Adeline Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882  28 March 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century.  - Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 190911, revised and expanded in 191415 and first serialized in the magazine \\"The Egoist\\" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women, and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regardsespecially in its English formas a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are, ironically, a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis's own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler.  - The Leeds Arts Club was founded in 1903 by the Leeds school teacher Alfred Orage and Yorkshire textile manufacture Holbrook Jackson, and was probably one of the most advanced centres for modernist thinking in Britain in the pre-First World War period.   - Percy Wyndham Lewis (18 November 1882  7 March 1957) was an English painter and critic (he dropped the name 'Percy', which he disliked). He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art, and edited the literary magazine of the Vorticists, \\"BLAST\\". His novels include his pre-World War I-era novel \\"Tarr\\" (set in Paris), and \\"The Human Age\\", a trilogy comprising \\"The Childermass\\" (1928), \\"Monstre Gai\\" and \\"Malign Fiesta\\" (both 1955), set in the afterworld. A fourth volume of \\"The Human Age\\", \\"The Trial of Man,\\" was begun by Lewis but left in a fragmentary state at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes, \\"Blasting and Bombardiering\\" (1937) and \\"Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date\\" (1950).

Answer the question...when did the internet first become available to the public??","output":"In order to answer the question about when the internet first became available to the public, I will take the following steps: Step 1: Define the Internet The internet, as we understand it today, is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate. Step 2: Identify key milestones in the development of the Internet - ARPANET (1960s): The earliest form of the Internet was ARPANET, developed by the United States Department of Defense in the late 1960s. - TCP/IP (1983): ARPANET adopted the TCP/IP protocol suite on January 1, 1983, and this marked the beginning of the modern Internet. Step 3: Determine when the Internet became accessible to the general public - World Wide Web (WWW): The WWW, invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed through the Internet using web browsers. The invention of the World Wide Web is what truly made the Internet accessible and practical for the general public. - Public availability of the WWW: In August 1991, Tim Berners-Lee publicly announced the World Wide Web, making it available for public use. Based on these steps, I can conclude that the Internet, as we know it today, became available to the public in August 1991 when the World Wide Web was publicly announced by Sir Tim Berners-Lee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bengals extended their lead with an 8-yard TD pass to wide receiver Chad Johnson.  In the second quarter, kicker Shayne Graham made a 37-yard field goal as time ran out to give Cincinnati a 17-3 halftime lead. In the fourth quarter, Graham would give the Bengals a 37-yard field goal, and the Browns responded with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Reuben Droughns.  Two touchdown runs by Bengal running back Rudi Johnson put the game out of reach.  The Browns scored one more touchdown with quarterback Charlie Frye's 2-yard run, but it was not enough as the Bengals improved to 2-0. Several Bengals were injured during this game. David Pollack, a 2nd year linebacker, suffered a non-paralyzing broken neck (fracturing his C6 vertebra), and would miss the rest of the season. Safety Dexter Jackson suffered a severe ankle sprain.

So what next for Jones and his side as they try and hunt down the world champions? Head coach Eddie Jones captured the mood of an excited nation after England completed an historic 3-0 whitewash in Australia, just months after sealing a first Grand Slam in 13 years. \\"I'm sure that everyone at home who watched the three Tests can't wait to see us play in November,\\" the Australian said. \\"They must be lining up at Twickenham now trying to get seats.\\" Next up for England are the autumn Tests against South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia. Jones says England were too inconsistent across the series, best illustrated by the lax defensive displays in the first and third Test matches. Defence coach Paul Gustard will be tasked with ensuring the heroic rearguard effort in the second Test in Melbourne was not a one-off. \\"We've got a lot of hard work ahead of us,\\" Jones told BBC Sport after Saturday's 44-40 victory in Sydney. \\"We have serious deficiencies in our consistency, but that will come with time and with more detailed practice. \\"The All Blacks beat Wales by a big score, which just shows their incredible relentlessness. We don't have that yet but that's where we are aiming to go.\\" Jones will be aware that the Wallabies were hampered in the series by injury and unavailability, and the players acknowledge there is plenty to work on. \\"We are not the finished article by any means,\\" said scrum-half Ben Youngs. \\"We have got to kick on from where we are.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Before the Six Nations, Jones said England lacked \\"world-class players\\", so have any of his charges elevated themselves to that level since then? \\"[Number eight] Billy Vunipola was absolutely outstanding, while his brother Mako really came through on this tour,\\" Jones said. \\"I thought Owen [Farrell] and George [Ford] really grew as guys who could control a game, they knew when to run, knew when to kick, and knew when to pass. So they are the guys that really stood out.\\" Jones also had special praise for prop Dan Cole, who has been another key performer for England after a difficult World Cup, while flankers James Haskell and Chris Robshaw were also outstanding and lock Maro Itoje has continued his staggering development. Farrell scored an astonishing 66 points in the series, nailing 23 out of his 26 kicks at goal in the process. At the start of the season the debate was whether  Farrell or Ford should play at fly-half; this tour has shown that there must be a place for Farrell in the starting XV, regardless of the number on his back. The Saracen has been compared to all-time great Jonny Wilkinson by the Australian media because of his relentless accuracy from the tee and, if he stays fit, chasing down Wilkinson's England points record is not unfeasible. But while Jones has spoken in the past of his desire for a big ball-carrier at inside-centre - Luther Burrell started the series in Brisbane - it will now be hard to break up the Ford and Farrell combination at 10 and 12, with both players excelling down under. The two could become \\"legends of the game\\" according to skills coach Glen Ella, and it would be a surprise if they both don't start in the autumn. However, Jones will have options in the midfield: Manu Tuilagi will be drafted back into the squad if he can finally avoid injury, while Northampton's Harry Mallinder caught the eye as he led the England to the World Rugby Under 20 Championship at the weekend. Then there is Ben Te'o, who didn't feature in the tour down under, but will be playing in the Premiership next season with Worcester. While urging his players to improve, Jones is looking to do likewise, and will spend time with the Orica GreenEDGE team at next month's Tour de France in the belief he must develop as a coach if England are to the top the world rankings. \\"I'm keen to have a look at what they do because I've got to get better,\\" he said. \\"If the team's not consistent, then our coaching's not good enough. You can never take your foot off the pedal.\\" England don't play New Zealand until 2017 at the earliest, and while supporters would love to see the side's resurgence tested against the best in the world, the schedule does present England with a genuine chance of going through 2016 unbeaten. South Africa, Fiji, Argentina and Australia visit Twickenham in the autumn, with all four matches eminently winnable. It may be that England have won 12 from 12 ahead of a rematch with the Wallabies on the first weekend of December. \\"Absolutely, there's no reason we can't [win every match],\\" said Youngs. \\"But there is a lot of rugby to be played between now and then. It's an exciting time for England rugby, and I feel very privileged to have been a part of this tour party.\\" \\"English rugby is in a good place,\\" reflected captain Dylan Hartley. \\"We were in a dark place maybe six months ago, and I hope we have now given the people something to cheer about.\\" Find out how to get into rugby union with our special guide.

However, coach Eddie Jones expressed concerns over the team's volatile performance and inconsistencies shown across recent series, particularly in defensive plays.

They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \\"Hammer A Nail\\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \\"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\\" Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \\"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work Apple, much to her fury.Ono began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \\"avant-garde bullshit\\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they \\"made love at dawn\\". When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \\"Oh, hi.\\" Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.Two years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War.

Later, they planned to continue this performance in the United States, but after being denied entry, they held the event at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal. Throughout these public protests and peace advocacy work, the couple often incorporated elements of performance art. This is seen in their concept of \\"Bagism,\\" which was first introduced during a press conference in Vienna. Even prior to their marriage, Lennon and Ono shared a deep connection with each other—a relationship that began shaping soon after their first meeting at a gallery exhibition in London, and that continued to evolve in the years that followed.

Now, to isolate t, we need to get rid of the coefficient -25. We can do that by dividing both sides of the equation by -25, since we want to reverse the multiplication process. (-25*t) / (-25) = (-150) / (-25) t = 6 Solution: The value of the variable t is 6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: A report from a high-volume single center indicated a survival benefit of receiving a kidney transplant from an HLA-incompatible live donor as compared with remaining on the waiting list, whether or not a kidney from a deceased donor was received. The generalizability of that finding is unclear.      In a 22-center study, we estimated the survival benefit for 1025 recipients of kidney transplants from HLA-incompatible live donors who were matched with controls who remained on the waiting list or received a transplant from a deceased donor (waiting-list-or-transplant control group) and controls who remained on the waiting list but did not receive a transplant (waiting-list-only control group). We analyzed the data with and without patients from the highest-volume center in the study.      Recipients of kidney transplants from incompatible live donors had a higher survival rate than either control group at 1 year (95.0%, vs. 94.0% for the waiting-list-or-transplant control group and 89.6% for the waiting-list-only control group), 3 years (91.7% vs. 83.6% and 72.7%, respectively), 5 years (86.0% vs. 74.4% and 59.2%), and 8 years (76.5% vs. 62.9% and 43.9%) (P<0.001 for all comparisons with the two control groups). The survival benefit was significant at 8 years across all levels of donor-specific antibody: 89.2% for recipients of kidney transplants from incompatible live donors who had a positive Luminex assay for anti-HLA antibody but a negative flow-cytometric cross-match versus 65.0% for the waiting-list-or-transplant control group and 47.1% for the waiting-list-only control group; 76.3% for recipients with a positive flow-cytometric cross-match but a negative cytotoxic cross-match versus 63.3% and 43.0% in the two control groups, respectively; and 71.0% for recipients with a positive cytotoxic cross-match versus 61.5% and 43.7%, respectively. The findings did not change when patients from the highest-volume center were excluded.      This multicenter study validated single-center evidence that patients who received kidney transplants from HLA-incompatible live donors had a substantial survival benefit as compared with patients who did not undergo transplantation and those who waited for transplants from deceased donors.

Surgeon Karim Zalazun looks at a monitor displaying a donor kidney for patient Adam Abernathy, who participated in a five-way organ transplant swap, in New York, August 1, 2012. REUTERS/Keith Bedford      A long-term study found that transplant recipients whose immune systems were technically incompatible to the donated kidney - because they had so-called anti-HLA antibodies - were more likely to be alive eight years later than people who did not receive a transplant or waited to get an organ from a deceased donor.      “We used to say if you had a compatible donor, you could do a transplant. Now you can say, if you have an incompatible donor, we still can make that transplant happen,” senior author Dr. Dorry Segev of John Hopkins University in Baltimore told Reuters Health. “That’s very exciting to those on the waiting list.”      Eight-year survival rates were almost 77 percent for 1,025 people who received an HLA-incompatible kidney from a live donor, 63 percent for 5,125 matched patients who remained on a waiting list for a kidney or received a kidney from a deceased donor and 44 percent for 5,125 people who remained on the waiting list without receiving a kidney.      “The paper is showing how much longer the patient will live compared to their next available option,” said Segev, who directs John Hopkins’ Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation. “Your next best option is waiting on the list for a compatible donor, and a lot of those patients will never find one.”      The study was done at 22 centers. It could help the more than 32,000 people in the United States who have anti-HLA antibodies and need a transplant.      “It’s all about timing,” said Dr. Sanjay Kulkarni, director of kidney and pancreas transplantation at Yale-New Haven Hospital and the Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. “The longer people are on dialysis before they have a transplant, the worse their survival,” he said.      “So if you have a living donor, instead of waiting five years for a compatible donor, if you can get a transplant from an incompatible donor in a couple of months, this paper suggests that that is beneficial, despite the fact that they have a higher rate of rejection,” he told Reuters Health.      “The implications of these results are revolutionary, especially when the numerous contradictory opinions raised by the transplant community are considered,” said Drs. Lionel Rostaing and Paolo Malvezzi of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes in La Tronche, France, in an editorial accompanying the study in the New England Journal of Medicine.      Desensitizing recipients can be very expensive, they said, and the immunosuppressive regimens required carry the potential of infection and cancer. In addition, living donors face a small but significant increase in their risk of end stage renal disease.      Nonetheless, Rostaing and Malvezzi write, using incompatible kidneys from living donors “may save lives and may be cost-effective over time.”      There is an added cost, but it is relatively small, Segev said.      Each patient’s immune system has to be desensitized to accept the incompatible kidney. Depending on antibody levels, “it can take a few days to a couple of weeks,” he said. “But compared to the cost of a transplant, it’s relatively low. If a transplant costs perhaps 100,000 and you add desensitization, it might be 110,000 to 120,000.”      There’s the additional cost of 10,000 or so each year for drugs to keep the immune system from rejecting the kidney. “But compared to 100,000 a year f dialysis,” he said, a transplant quickly becomes cost effective over time.      Kulkarni cautioned that the organ donation system was changed just over two years ago to make it easier for hard-to-match patients to get a kidney from a deceased donor.      Now “people are getting transplanted much quicker” so today’s survival rates may not be as dramatically different as they are in the new study, he said. “But I bet they still hold.”      SOURCE: bit.ly/24R0D0j New England Journal of Medicine, online March 9, 2016. ||||| Summary:","output":"A new study from the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that transplanting a mismatched kidney from a living donor may lower the risk of death more than not doing a transplant at all.

Movie plot title: Invincible Movie plot: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts. Breitbart foresees what will be known as the Holocaust and returns to Poland to warn the Jewish people... Answer:","output":"No answer"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: What is the name for the ‘wavy line’ above the letter n in words such as jalapeño and piñata?","output":"The 'wavy line' above the letter 'n' in words such as jalapeño and piñata is called a \\"tilde.\\" In the context of these specific words, it is also specifically referred to as the \\"virgulilla\\" or the \\"tilde de la eñe\\" in the Spanish language. The tilde is a diacritical mark used in various languages to provide additional information about the pronunciation and meaning of a written word. In the case of the Spanish language, the tilde above the letter 'n' transforms it into the distinct letter 'ñ,' which represents the palatal nasal sound (a sound produced with the middle part of the tongue against the hard palate) that is phonetically different from the regular 'n' sound. This sound is similar to the 'ny' sound in the English word \\"canyon.\\" The use of the tilde in Spanish can be traced back to medieval scribes who used it for abbreviating words. The letter 'ñ' originated as a ligature of two 'n's written together, with the tilde as a graphic representation of the second 'n.' Over time, the ligature and the tilde evolved into the distinct letter 'ñ' that we recognize today. Besides the Spanish language, the letter 'ñ' or other letters with a tilde are used in several other languages, such as Filipino, Galician, and Basque, among others. The role and pronunciation of the tilde in these languages may vary, but the general concept remains the same: It signifies a phonetic difference that sets the letter apart from its base form. In conclusion, the 'wavy line' above the letter 'n' in words like jalapeño and piñata is called a tilde. The presence of the tilde changes the letter from 'n' to a distinct letter called 'ñ,' which has a different phonetic sound that is crucial to the correct pronunciation and meaning of certain words in the Spanish language and other languages that use this diacritical mark."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The boy is one of four children from the same family at the centre of a 'mindboggling' police investigation, in which two of the children are believed to have been murdered and two others were almost killed in a deliberately lit house fire. The man's three-year-old son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found dead at a Moryafield home, on the Sunshine Coast on July 27 2013. His seven-month-old half-brother was found dead at the same address on September 27 2014. Scroll down for video. Father and son: The father of a three-year-old boy police believe was murdered in a crime linked to his grandmother wants justice for the dead toddler. The father of a toddler police believe was murdered on July 27 last year at the birth of his son. No one in the 'mindboggling' series of alleged crimes committed at Morayfield, north of Brisbane, can be identifed. This picture shows the father of a toddler who died in July last year. On February 27 2014, two other children living at the address - a nine-year-old and an 11-year-old - suffered burns and smoke inhalation when part of the house was set ablaze as they slept. Each alleged crime occurred on the 27th of the month, prompting police to investigate the 'coincidence'. Police investigating the two deaths and the fire are treating a grandmother as a person of interest in what they describe as a 'mindboggling' series of crimes at Morayfield, north of Brisbane. Until Friday, the father of the three-year-old believed his son had died of complications from a virus. Today, he was calling for justice for his boy, as well his son's half-brother and the two other boys. 'I just want to know what happened to my son,' he said. 'He was my little buddy.' On Saturday, the man changed his Facebook profile to feature a picture of his son below the words: 'Justice for (the boy's name)'. He had also written the message: 'Justice for all 4. 3 other boys went though hell to so please dont forget about them'. A relative of the man had posted: 'RIP my little pumpernickel I knew it would all come out in the end. Luvs ya and miss ya heaps (boy's name) xxxxx I'm so sorry I wasn't there to protect you.' Another user posted: 'How could someone be so evil? Such a innocent little boy' The father of the three-year-old, who had separated from the boy's mother and was not living with his son when he died, has pleaded for anyone with information to come forward and help police. '(My son) was a really healthy little boy,' he said. 'When I got the call that night he was at the hospital, something didn’t add up - he was a healthy three-year-old boy. ‘How did my little buddy die?’ Detectives have described a grandmother as being a person of interest in the investigation into the deaths of the two boys and the alleged attempted killing of the other two children as they slept in their beds. The alleged crimes all occurred at the same home in Morayfield and the grandmother was present during each incident. No one has been charged. The deaths of the three-year-old and the seven-month old were initially treated as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) cases, police said. Horror scene: Queensland police have recreated the moment the kids were nearly murdered in their beds by fire as they slept. Firefighters remove the bed from the makeshift home. Police believe the children were deliberately blocked from exiting their bedroom. Blaze: A scene from the police recreation of the attempted murder of two kids. The alleged crimes all occurred at a home in Morayfield, toward the Sunshine Coast north of Brisbane. On February 27 this year two boys aged nine and 11 were asleep in their beds in the same home when the house was set ablaze. The children survived but based on a forensic recreation of the arson attack, detectives believe someone had deliberately blocked their escape pathway from the bedroom. Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific. 'To have it happen to defenceless children is just mindboggling,' he told reporters on Friday evening. Supt Hansen would not identify any family members. Both children and other occupants of the burning house were treated for smoke inhalation. 'The children were inside the room and could not exit the room,' he said. One child suffered burns to his lower limbs and was treated at Caboolture Hospital. Queensland Police have provided vision of a recreation of the case, above, featuring police staff and an unknown woman. 'Just mindboggling': Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific. Firefighters: The incidents all occurred at the one address in Morayfield. This is a Queensland Fire and Rescue re-enactment of the fire which nearly claimed the lives of two children. Police are investigating whether there is a reason why the crimes all occurred on the 27th of the month, Supt Hansen said. 'It's a matter being investigated,' he said, although he ruled out any religious or cult links to the crimes. The detective would not rule out the involvement of other people but said police have 'strong leads'. 'We are very confident we have the right line of enquiry with this investigation and will have a conclusion in the near future,' he said. The surviving children are now in state care. Police are calling for anyone with information that could help the investigation or witnessed the house fire on February 27 and the early hours of February 28 to contact CrimeStoppers on 1800 333 000.

TheghettoesofRussiaandPolandwereanessentialandintegralpartoftheTalmudicorganizationandanyattempttoabolishthemwouldhavebeendenouncedaspersecution. Please segment the words:","output":"The ghettos of Russia and Poland were an essential and integral part of the Talmudic organization, and any attempt to abolish them would have been denounced as persecution. Now, I will provide a detailed analysis of the statement above. Ghettos were originally found in various regions throughout Europe, including Russia and Poland, where they played a significant role in Jewish and general European history. Ghettos were confined urban areas designated to the Jewish community to live in, often enclosed by walls or fences and under strict social, economic, and religious limitations. The Talmudic organization refers to the Jewish religious community that adhered to the teachings of the Talmud, an ancient set of texts that is central to the study and practice of Jewish law. The Talmud contains a collection of interpretations, commentaries, and discussions based on scriptures from the Hebrew Bible, mainly the Torah and Mishnah. It holds a profound influence on Jewish thought, legal interpretation, and cultural norms, even today. During the time when ghettos were prevalent in Russia and Poland, the Jewish population was deeply rooted in the Talmudic organization, which shaped their everyday lives and practices. The ghettos not only confined the Jewish people to a specific area within the city due to social segregation but also played a unique role in the consolidation and continuity of Jewish religious, cultural, and educational life. The ghettos provided a space for Jewish communities to maintain their religious practices, customs, and traditions, preserving their heritage in an often hostile environment. The Jewish scholars found in the ghettos were responsible for leading the study and education of the Talmud and other religious texts; as a result, they helped maintain the strength and survival of Jewish religious life. Despite the harsh living conditions and restrictions in the ghettos, any attempts to abolish or dismantle them were seen as a direct threat to Jewish religious and community life. Such an action would be considered persecution because it would cause the dismantling of communities and the subsequent scattering of Jewish people, leading to loss of cohesion and continuity in the Talmudic organization. Furthermore, the forced assimilation of the Jewish population into the non-Jewish-dominated society would challenge their unique religious and cultural identity, potentially eroding the basis of Jewish community life. Therefore, Jewish individuals and communities would actively resist the abolishment of ghettos as an attempt to disrupt their way of life. In summation, the ghettospace and structure provided Jewish communities in Russia and Poland with a means to maintain their unique religious, cultural, and educational practices rooted in Talmudic teachings, despite the many limitations and hardships. The abolishment of ghettos was perceived as a direct threat and persecution, as it would disrupt the Jewish community's cohesiveness and challenge their adherence to Talmudic values and traditions, thus risking their cultural identity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - garage - white house - synagogue - hospital - demonstration  I believe the correct choice is \\"garage\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"Garage\\" To understand why \\"garage\\" is the most suitable answer to this question, let's take a closer look at each of the possible options and analyze the context in which a person surrounded by tools and oil cans would be found. 1. Garage: A garage is typically a space where vehicles are stored, maintained, and repaired. It is a common setting for individuals to be surrounded by various tools and oil cans, which are used for automotive repair and maintenance tasks. People who work in a garage, such as mechanics or car enthusiasts, regularly use tools like wrenches, screwdrivers, and jacks, as well as oil cans for tasks like changing engine oil and lubricating parts. Hence, a person being surrounded by these items would most likely be found in a garage.  2. White House: The White House is the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States. While there may be maintenance personnel who use tools and oil cans in the course of their duties, such as repairing vehicles in the Presidential fleet, it would be unusual to find someone surrounded by these items inside the main building. Furthermore, these maintenance tasks would be carried out in a designated garage or workshop area, not in the White House itself. Thus, this option isn't an appropriate fit. 3. Synagogue: A synagogue is a place of worship for people who practice Judaism. It is primarily a space for prayer, spiritual guidance, and community gathering. Tools and oil cans aren't typically found or used in a synagogue, as it is not a typical environment for vehicle maintenance or repair. As a result, it would be unlikely to find a person surrounded by these items in a synagogue. 4. Hospital: A hospital is a place where people receive medical care, treatment, and diagnosis. While hospitals do have various tools for medical purposes, tools and oil cans related to vehicle maintenance are not commonly found in hospital settings. Such items wouldn't be relevant to the primary functions and responsibilities of healthcare workers. Thus, a person surrounded by tools and oil cans would not generally be found in a hospital. 5. Demonstration: A demonstration refers to a public gathering of people to protest or advocate for specific causes. Typically, demonstrations take place in outdoor settings or public spaces and focus on political or social issues, not activities such as vehicle repair or maintenance. It is highly improbable that someone surrounded by tools and oil cans would be found participating in a demonstration. In conclusion, taking into account the contexts in which each of the given options is associated with, the correct choice is \\"garage.\\" A garage is the most suitable environment for a person to be surrounded by tools and oil cans, as it is a space specifically designated for storing, maintaining, and repairing vehicles. None of the other options presents a logical connection to someone being surrounded by these particular items."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"Tuppence read it over her shoulder.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Tuppence looked over her right shoulder to read it. \\"?","output":"The given premise states: \\"Tuppence read it over her shoulder.\\" This statement gives us some information about Tuppence and her actions - she is reading something and she is doing so over her shoulder. Importantly, this statement doesn't specify which shoulder - left or right - Tuppence looked over. Given this premise, we try to assess the entailing hypothesis: \\"Tuppence looked over her right shoulder to read it.\\"  Entailment in its core linguistic and logical sense means that whenever the truth of a statement (premise) guarantees the truth of another (hypothesis), the latter is entailed by the former.  In this case, the premise does not provide enough specific information to guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The hypothesis details that Tuppence used her right shoulder to read, and such a detail isn't available in the premise. Her reading over her shoulder could refer equally to her left or her right shoulder. Therefore, we cannot confidently say that from the given premise - \\"Tuppence read it over her shoulder.\\"- it directly entails the specific hypothesis \\"Tuppence looked over her right shoulder to read it.\\" The given hypothesis heavily banks on the assumption that Tuppence was looking over her right shoulder. However, assumptions are not enough to confirm the logical entailment of a hypothesis; we need the premise to state factual information that directly aligns with or equals the hypothesis. In conclusion, the premise \\"Tuppence read it over her shoulder.\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"Tuppence looked over her right shoulder to read it.\\" due to a lack of specificity about which shoulder it was in the premise. This would be an invalid inference, as the premise doesn't provide enough specific information to confirm the hypothesis.  For the entailment to hold true, the premise should be redefined with additional information - for instance, \\"Tuppence read it over her right shoulder\\" - that matches and confirms the conditions of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis mentioned in the question implies that a person is trying to use up all the food they have, which may result in less batter being mixed until smooth. This supposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the pancake-making process, as outlined below: Direct Effects: 1. Change in Pancake Consistency: Since there would be less batter mixed until smooth, this could result in uneven distribution of ingredients. The pancakes may have a different consistency as compared to a batter mixed until smooth, possibly making them denser or heavier.  2. Uneven Cooking: A batter that is not mixed until smooth may cause the pancakes to cook unevenly on the griddle or frying pan. Some parts of the pancake may be overcooked, while other parts could remain undercooked or raw. Indirect Effects: 1. Variation in Batch Sizes: If a person is trying to use up all the food, they might alter the measurements of the original recipe or make multiple batches to ensure they use up all the ingredients. This could lead to irregular-sized pancakes in different batches, affecting the overall cooking process. 2. Ingredient Substitution: To use up items, a person might substitute some ingredients, like using skim milk instead of whole milk or using melted margarine instead of butter. Such substitutions can change the texture of the pancakes and affect the taste or cooking process. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of using up all available food and possibly having less batter mixed until smooth can directly impact the pancake-making process by causing changes to the consistency and cooking of the pancakes. Indirectly, it can lead to changes in the recipe and possible ingredient substitutions, which could also affect the outcome."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Elroy Leon \\"Crazylegs\\" Hirsch (June 17, 1923 - January 28, 2004) was an American football player, sport executive and actor. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974. He was also named to the all-time All-Pro team selected in 1968 and to the National Football League (NFL) 1950s All-Decade Team. A native of Wausau, Wisconsin, Hirsch played college football as a halfback at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan, helping to lead both the 1942 Badgers and the 1943 Wolverines to No. 3 rankings in the final AP Polls. In January 1945, the Cleveland Rams selected Hirsch in the first round (fifth overall pick) of the 1945 NFL Draft. In May, he announced that he would not sign a contract with the Rams, stating that he intended to return to the University of Wisconsin after his discharge from the military.  He ultimately opted not to play in the NFL, instead playing for the Chicago Rockets of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Hirsch chose the Rockets because they were coached by Dick Hanley, who had been Hirsch's coach with the El Toro Marines team. Hirsch played three seasons with the Rockets from 1946 to 1948. During those three years, the Rockets compiled a 7-32 record and won only one game in each of the 1947 and 1948 seasons. Hirsch later said the decision to sign with the Rockets was the worst decision he ever made.  In a remarkable display of versatility, Hirsch appeared in all 14 games for the Rockets in 1946, contributing 1,445 yards: 384 kickoff return yards and one touchdown; 347 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns; 235 punt return yards and one touchdown; 226 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown; 156 passing yards and one passing touchdown; and 97 return yards on six interceptions.  In September 1947, Hirsch caught a 76-yard touchdown pass for an AAFC record. However, injuries limited Hirsch to five games in 1947. He was described in December 1947 as probably \\"the highest paid waterboy in pro football.\\"  In the fifth game of the 1948 season, Hirsch sustained a fracture on the right side of his skull after being kicked in the head during a game against the Cleveland Browns. Hirsch did not return to action during the 1948 season, totaling 101 receiving yards and 93 rushing yards in five games.","output":"This text is about Elroy Leon \\"Crazylegs\\" Hirsch, who was an American football player, sport executive, and actor.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: My first memory of cooking was with my grandmother, Rosemary, in Sydney. She taught me how to make scrambled eggs on her electric stovetop, the kind with the coiled heating elements, in her small, linoleum-lined kitchen with cupboards that stuck a little when they closed. She was not an exceptional cook — I can remember plenty of bland and overcooked vegetables and custard made with powder to pour into pre-bought pie cases with tinned pineapple, her specialty — but she worked hard to put a balanced, home-cooked meal on the table three times a day, every day. The eldest of eight children, she dropped out of school during the Depression to help her single mother look after her siblings and work as a seamstress at David Jones. When the Second World War broke out and she was engaged to my grandfather, Aubrey, she started working on war-torn planes (“sometimes looking as if a steam roller has gone over them,” she said) as a sheet metal worker, putting them back together, when many of the men who used to do this work were off fighting the war. She said it was just like dressmaking, only using different materials. She had a twinkle in her eye and a distinct laugh that can really only be described as a cackle. She was a strong, incredibly smart woman with a fighter spirit who led her female co-workers out on the airport tarmac one day on a strike to earn equal wages to men. I am so proud that her story is taught as part of the Australian primary school curriculum. Her dream was to have a home with that electric stove. In 1943 when she was 28 she was interviewed for Australian Women’s Weekly magazine for an article on women in men’s jobs during the war, where there is a photo of her that is etched in my memory, dressed in white, wearing a white bandana tied in a knot at the top of her dark curls, a plane behind her.

But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.

For example, they will say\\"It's a fine day, isn't it?\\"\\"Do you think it will rain?\\" Many people believe that they are able to tell what the weather will be like. But they never agree with each other. One man may say, \\"How cloudy   it is now! It's going to rain.\\" Another man will say, \\"No, it's going to be fine later.\\" People always hope the weather they want. For example, when a farmer needs water, he looks for something to tell him it's going to rain. When a man wants to travel, he is sure the weather will be fine quickly. Now almost everyone listens to the weather report. It doesn't always tell us the weather we want, it only tells us what the weather will be like. But sometimes it makes mistakes . ,.

Plot title: Bamboozled Movie plot: In a New York City residence, Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) rises to begin his daily routine. Brushing his teeth, he gives us by voice over a definition of satire. He tells us that with the rise of the Internet, video and interactive games, his field as a television writer has seen a drop in popularity. Meanwhile, in a dilapidated building, squatter Womack (Tommy Davidson) wakes up his friend Manray (Savion Glover) for a day of work. This consists of travelling to the CNS (Continental Network System) building where Delacroix works, and Manray tap dancing to entertain the workers. They then collect money from the workers. The men see Delacroix walk by, and ask him for monetary help in the form of work of some kind.Delacroix walks into a staff meeting late and is immediately castigated by his boss, Thomas Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport). Dunwitty informs the staff that CNS has poor ratings. He says he wants them to write funnier material, and ends the meeting. In the privacy of his office, Dunwitty tells Delacroix that the material Delacroix's been writing for him seems like it's about white people with black faces. Dunwitty asserts that Delacroix is an \\"oreo\\" with his Harvard education, because he won't write a \\"n----r show.\\"The next day, Delacroix and his assistant Sloan Hopkins (Jada Pinkett Smith) talk. They've decided that Manray is the solution to his problem. Delacroix plans to write a show that will be so \\"offensive and racist,\\" it will prove his point that the network only wants to see black buffoons on the air. Delacroix simply hopes to be fired, so he can be let go of his contract with CNS. Manray and Womack ask at the receptionist's desk for a \\"Delapoint\\" and the men working there tell them to step outside. However, Sloan steps into the lobby, sees what's happening, and escorts Manray and Womack to Delacroix's office. Delacroix explains to them that he has an idea for a television pilot, and they can make money with it. His main request is that Manray changes his name to Mantan, in an apparent homage...

In this math problem, \\"i\\" is what we're trying to find. It's like a secret treasure that we need to discover. To do that, we have to move the pieces of the puzzle around and put them in the right spots. So, the problem gives us: 282*i + 68*i = -573*i - 86762 Now, we're going to combine the \\"i\\" terms on the left side, like putting two bags of the same fruits together: (282 + 68)*i = 350*i That means the problem now looks like: 350*i = -573*i - 86762 Now, we want to put all the \\"i\\" terms on one side of the equal sign. To do that, we'll add 573*i to both sides: (350 + 573)*i = 923*i So now we have: 923*i = -86762 The next step is to find the treasure (the value of \\"i\\"). To do that, we need to make \\"i\\" all by itself on one side of the equal sign. We'll divide both sides by 923: i = -86762 / 923 When we do the division, we find that: i = -94 So, the secret treasure (the value of \\"i\\") is -94, and that's the solution to the math problem!

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Jaimey struggled in life","output":"Yes, the following sentence does follow given the preceding text: Jaimey struggled in life. The preceding text provides context for Jaimey's struggles and hardships due to the social isolation she faced in high school as a result of the false rumor spread about her. This exclusion was caused by her peers' belief that she had a disease, which was a fabrication created by her so-called friends. Consequently, not a single boy in high school showed any interest in her or even made eye contact. Living in this kind of social isolation, Jaimey experienced a significant lack of meaningful connections and relationships with her peers, which likely had a significant negative impact on her overall well-being, self-esteem, and emotional state. Navigating her high school years without the support and connection that are generally considered essential during this time of adolescence would have presented Jaimey with considerable challenges and difficulties. The fact that she decided to confront a group of boys and ask why they were treating her this way shows her resilience and determination to overcome these challenges. However, the discovery that her friends were the ones who started the rumor would understandably be another blow to her already weakened confidence and emotional state, potentially exacerbating her struggles in life. In summary, the sentence \\"Jaimey struggled in life\\" accurately follows the given context as it highlights the various challenges and obstacles she faced due to the false rumor and the subsequent social isolation that resulted from her friends' betrayal. This sentence effectively captures the overall theme of Jaimey's hardships and difficulties in life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"12 states sue EPA over agency's alleged 'sue and settle' tactics\\"","output":"Title: 12 States Sue EPA Over Agency's Alleged 'Sue and Settle' Tactics Introduction: In a recent turn of events, 12 US states have united to file a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), accusing them of engaging in alleged 'sue and settle' tactics. The lawsuit emphasizes the concerns of these states about the potentially negative consequences of the EPA's seemingly opaque and non-transparent approach to policy-making and enforcement. (Step 1: Introduce the main topic and context of the article.) Background on 'Sue and Settle': The term 'sue and settle' refers to a controversial legal strategy in which an agency adopts regulations and enforces policies in response to lawsuits initiated by outside groups, often without giving affected stakeholders the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. Critics argue that this tactic enables agencies like the EPA to operate behind closed doors, following agendas defined by external parties rather than public interest. (Step 2: Explain the concept of 'sue and settle', its implications, and why it's controversial.) The States Involved: The states taking part in the lawsuit against the EPA are predominantly located in the South and Midwest regions of the United States. They include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. The Attorney General of each state has expressed dissatisfaction with the EPA's alleged use of 'sue and settle' tactics for bypassing the required procedures and undermining state sovereignty. (Step 3: List the states involved in the lawsuit and briefly outline their concerns.) The Allegations: According to the lawsuit, the EPA's alleged 'sue and settle' tactics have been primarily utilized in the development and enforcement of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and other essential environmental regulations. The states claim that the EPA has settled lawsuits initiated by environmental advocacy groups, resulting in tighter regulations and heightened enforcement of existing rules without providing proper transparency or engaging in requisite public participation processes. Furthermore, the states are concerned that these tactics may erode their ability to respond to local environmental issues and prioritize resources effectively. (Step 4: Detail the specific allegations against the EPA and the potential consequences of their actions.) Response from the EPA: In response to the lawsuit, the EPA has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that they remain committed to involving stakeholders in their decision-making processes. The agency argues that their actions in settling lawsuits are rooted in a desire to conserve resources and avoid long-drawn litigation, rather than bypassing public participation or state sovereignty. (Step 5: Present the EPA's response and perspective on the allegations.) Potential Impacts and Next Steps: If the states succeed in their lawsuit against the EPA, it could have wide-ranging implications for the way the agency operates moving forward. The EPA may be forced to reevaluate its approach to lawsuits, ensuring greater transparency and collaboration with affected parties. It remains to be seen how the lawsuit will unfold and what impact it will have on the future of environmental regulation and enforcement in the United States. (Step 6: Discuss the possible outcomes of the lawsuit and the potential impacts on the EPA and environmental regulations.) Conclusion: The lawsuit filed by the 12 states against the EPA is a significant development in the ongoing debate surrounding the use of 'sue and settle' tactics in environmental regulation and policy-making. As the case progresses, it will be crucial to pay close attention to the arguments presented by both sides and the potential consequences it might have on the EPA's overall approach to ensuring environmental protection, while maintaining transparency and upholding state sovereignty. (Step 7: Summarize the overall significance of the lawsuit and its implications for environmental regulation and policy-making.)"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this instance: lfflllflff Student:","output":"Yes, I understand the problem. To find the longest substring that is a palindrome, we need to look for a sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For the given string lfflllflff, let's analyze it: 1. We can start by looking at each character as a single palindrome, so the shortest possible palindrome is length 1 (either 'l' or 'f'). 2. Then, we can search for larger palindromes by checking pairs, triples, etc., in the string. 3. The largest pair here is 'ff' which occurs three times. 4. However, there is an even longer palindrome in this string, which is 'lll' (reading the same forward and backward). 5. No other substring longer than 'lll' forms a palindrome in the given string. Based on this analysis, the longest palindrome substring in the string lfflllflff is 'lll'. I used the definition of a palindrome to first find the shortest possible palindrome, then I looked for larger palindromes by checking pairs, triples, etc. until I found the longest palindrome substring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: as in metric size hole or a or an American sized hole Sentence 2: It's probably a metric hole, but I thin you might be referring to an American hole? If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true, let's analyze both sentences step-by-step: 1. Understand each sentence:    - Sentence 1: as in metric size hole or a or an American sized hole        - This sentence is referring to a hole that can either have a metric size measurement, or an American size measurement.    - Sentence 2: It's probably a metric hole, but I thin you might be referring to an American hole?        - This sentence is expressing that the hole is likely to be a metric-sized hole, but the speaker is uncertain and thinks it might also be possible that the listener is referring to an American-sized hole. There's also a typo in the sentence (thin should be think).   2. Compare the content and logic of these two sentences:    - Sentence 1 is considering two possibilities, while sentence 2 is suggesting one possibility with greater probability (metric) and questioning the other possibility (American). 3. Evaluate if the second sentence is true when the first sentence is true:    - If the first sentence is true, it means that there are two possible sizes for the hole - metric and American. In the second sentence, it is also considering both metric and American hole sizes, but with a specific probability express about them (probably metric). So, we can say that the second sentence is mostly in line with the first sentence in terms of considering both possible sizes. However, the second sentence contains a typo (thin -> think) and expresses a probability relationship that is not explicitly mentioned in the first sentence. Considering the analysis, the second sentence can be considered true (ignoring the typo) when the first sentence is true, but with the caveat that the probability relationship mentioned in the second sentence isn't explicitly stated in the first sentence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

City sees overhaul as precursor to sale, leaving group focused on &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; P amp;O staked its immediate future as a ferry operator on the burgeoning freight market yesterday as it blamed the death of the booze cruise for the need to axe one-fifth of its workforce. What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a major reorganization and potential sale of the city's ferry operating company, P&O. The company has experienced significant challenges, particularly the decline of the \\"booze cruise\\" segment, which has led to a refocusing on the freight market and the need to cut their workforce by 20%.  P&O, a ferry operator, had previously relied on the popularity of \\"booze cruises\\" - leisure trips in which passengers enjoy duty-free alcohol purchases and socializing aboard the cruise. However, the decline in these operations' profitability forced P&O to seek alternative revenue sources. As a result, the company decided to concentrate on the freight market for growth. The shift in focus was seen as a necessary move for P&O's survival in an increasingly competitive market. However, this strategic change had consequences on the company's employees, with one-fifth of them being laid off. This significant reduction in workforce likely had an impact on the morale and job security of the remaining employees. The text also suggests that this overhaul might be a precursor to the potential sale of the city's ferry operation, with P&O divesting this segment of its business. In doing so, the company would aim to become a more streamlined and focused enterprise, primarily dealing with the more lucrative freight segment. By specializing in freight, P&O expected to become more competitive and profitable, increasing its chances of attracting a buyer in case the company were to be sold.  Ultimately, the text highlights the challenges faced by the city's ferry operator, P&O, as it navigates a changing market landscape. It sheds light on the decline of the popular \\"booze cruise\\" industry and its impact on the company's direction and workforce. Moreover, it brings attention to the potential sale and overhaul of P&O, as the company aims to find new success and relevance in the growing freight market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.  - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling).  - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine.  - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland.  - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).  - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.  - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature.  - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\"  \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\"  \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives.  - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living.   - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs.  Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Next question: who has won the icc world cup of 2011?","output":"The 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup was won by the Indian national cricket team. The tournament took place from February 19th to April 2nd, 2011, and was co-hosted by India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. This was the 10th edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup and featured 14 participating teams. India emerged as the ultimate victors in a thrilling final match held at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, India. They faced Sri Lanka, who were also vying for the prestigious title. The Sri Lankan team batted first and posted a target score of 274 runs for the loss of six wickets. Their innings was anchored by a magnificent unbeaten 103 off 88 balls by veteran cricketer Mahela Jayawardene. Chasing a daunting target of 275 to claim the trophy, India lost their explosive opening batsman Virender Sehwag for a duck and then their batting powerhouse Sachin Tendulkar with only 31 runs on the board. However, India's middle-order batsmen demonstrated their resilience, with Gautam Gambhir scoring a crucial 97 runs and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni coming in at a crucial juncture to take control of the situation. With the match hanging in the balance, Dhoni played a captain's innings and remained unbeaten on 91 runs, including the iconic six he hit to seal the victory. India won the match by six wickets and with ten balls to spare, ending a 28-year wait for the nation since their first World Cup triumph back in 1983. The 2011 Indian World Cup squad included the following players: 1. Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Captain, Wicketkeeper) 2. Virender Sehwag (Vice-Captain, Opening batsman) 3. Sachin Tendulkar (Batsman) 4.

According to the guidelines, if two numbers have the same absolute value, one being positive and the other negative, the positive one should be selected. After the element with the maximum absolute value is determined, the actual value of this element (including its original sign) must be returned. There are three main steps to this task: 1. Apply the absolute value to every element in the list. This can be done by changing the sign of the number to positive if it's negative. The absolute value for negative numbers can be found by multiplying them by -1. 2. Find the element with the maximum absolute value. This involves comparing each number's absolute value and retaining the one that is greatest. 3. Return the original value of the number identified in step 2 (with its original sign).

Question: What does Calvin plot to steal? Title: Little Man Movie plot: This article needs an improved plot summary. (October 2015) Calvin \\"Babyface\\" Simms (Marlon Wayans) is a very short convict. With the help of his goofball cohort Percy (Tracy Morgan), Calvin plots a jewellery shop robbery to steal one of the world's largest diamonds. After the successful robbery, the duo are almost arrested, but not before Calvin manages to stash the diamond in a nearby woman's purse. The thieves follow the handbag's owner to her home where they discover a couple, Darryl (Shawn Wayans) and Vanessa Edwards (Kerry Washington), who are eager to have a child. Calvin and Percy hatch a plot to pass Calvin off as a baby left on the couple's doorstep. Darryl and Vanessa, wanting a child, immediately adopt the baby as their own. However, Vanessa's dad Francis \\"Pops\\" (John Witherspoon) has a bad feeling about Calvin. Friends of the couple find Calvin odd as well. A local goon named Walken (Chazz Palminteri), discovers the deception and demands the diamond from Percy. Percy sells out Darryl and now Calvin, in a series of comedic maneuvers, manages to rescue Darryl and have Walken arrested. Darryl is given a substantial reward for the recovery of the diamond, and since Calvin saved his life, he doesn't turn him over to the police.

Aaron felt guilty.; II. Randy felt guilty.;","output":"II. Randy felt guilty. At the birthday party, Aaron had a drink spilled all over them by Randy, so Randy felt guilty. This scenario illustrates the cause and effect relationship between actions and emotions. When Randy accidentally spilled the drink on Aaron, he would likely feel responsible for the mishap, leading to feelings of guilt. In addition to feeling guilty, Randy may experience other emotions, such as embarrassment or anxiety, as he realizes his actions may have caused discomfort or annoyance to Aaron. He may also be concerned about how others at the party perceive the situation, as it might impact his social standing and relationships. On the other hand, Aaron may feel surprised or upset initially at being drenched in the drink, but guilt is unlikely to be an emotion they would experience in this scenario. It is plausible that Aaron might share some empathy for Randy, who is now feeling guilty. Aaron might try to alleviate Randy's guilt by reassuring him that accidents happen and there are no hard feelings. In conclusion, the sentence would end with \\"Randy felt guilty,\\" since Randy is the one responsible for the mishap and would experience guilt as a consequence of his actions. It emphasizes the concept of guilt being tied to responsibility and the recognition of one's error."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"In order to determine whether the hypothesis, \\"It is a changed world,\\" is entailed by the premise, \\"it was it's it's a different world,\\" we must first analyze the premise, interpret its intended meaning, and then consider whether the hypothesis follows logically from that meaning. Upon analyzing the premise \\"it was it's it's a different world,\\" it appears that there may be a few grammatical errors. It is possible that the intended meaning may be \\"it was, it is, it's a different world.\\" This interpretation suggests that the speaker is trying to emphasize that the world was different in the past, is different now, and it continues to be a different world.  Now let's analyze the hypothesis that \\"it is a changed world.\\" This statement implies that the world has undergone a transformation or shift from a previous state to the current state. Both the premise and the hypothesis are discussing the world and its condition, and both imply a sense of change or difference. Considering both the interpretation of the premise and the statement of the hypothesis, there is an overlap in the idea of a world that is different or changed. The premise suggests that the world has always been different and continues to be so, while the hypothesis emphasizes the change that the world has undergone.  In this context, the hypothesis can be seen as entailed by the premise, as both express the notion of a world in flux, undergoing changes, and being different from a past state. However, it should be noted that the premise contains a stronger emphasis on the constant state of difference, while the hypothesis focuses on the specific transformation from one state to another. Despite this slight difference in emphasis, the core idea of a world that is different or changed is still present in both statements, making the hypothesis a logical consequence of the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The doctor will dilate your cervix and insert a small vacuum through your vagina and into your uterus. The vacuum will remove the cystic tissue. The doctor will monitor your levels of HCG or human chorionic gonadotropin, which is how they can tell if all of the tissue is gone and if a cancer is developing after a molar pregnancy. This is why it is absolutely essential you go to your follow up appointments. If your HCG levels do not drop back to normal after treatment, it suggests that all the cystic tissue may not have been removed.  Remaining cystic tissue is usually effectively treated with chemotherapy, usually methotrexate. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, dizziness, or temporary hair loss.

The California ISO sends and receives thousands of electronic messages every day because of who we are and what we do. During the normal course of business, the majority of these messages contain attachments exchanging and providing information. One method used by malicious programs (Viruses, Worms, and Trojan-Horses) to spread is by electronic mail. It is the attachment that carries the malicious program, not the email itself. So, when a user opens an infected executable file, the malicious program is activated and initiates what it is programmed to do. Examples of executable files that may be infected include, but not limited to, Word documents (.doc), Excel spreadsheets (.xls), or Visual Basic files (.vbs). CAISO's Antivirus Program uses a three-tiered approach where scanning (detect, clean or delete) is performed on email messages with attachments at the Gateway Servers, the Mail Servers, and Users' PCs and Laptops. All incoming and outgoing email with attachments are scanned for all known viruses. That is a key element of an antivirus program. New viruses or new strains of computer viruses, worms, and Trojan-Horses are discovered at an alarming rate.

Article: Inmates 'pissy' over Lindsay Lohan's 'special' jail perks like a TV and dresser in her private cell      Seib-Pool/Getty Inmates who have recently left jail have heard Lindsay Lohan is receiving special treatment behind bars.      It looks like Lindsay Lohan's jailhouse honeymoon is over.      A day after inmates cheered her arrival, some prisoners are already grousing about the \\"Mean Girls\\" actress.      Even though officials have insisted Lohan is treated like everyone else - beyond getting her own cell - rumors flew that the star is enjoying perks.      \\"She's getting special treatment. Some inmates were getting pissy over it,\\" Debra Sickels, 30, said as she was released after doing 19 days for shoplifting.      Sickels said that during her stint, she was in the infirmary every day for medical treatment, \\"and the girls said they cleaned a special room for Lindsay. It had a regular hospital bed, a TV and a dresser for her new clothes and socks.\\"      Other just-sprung inmates said they heard Lohan was paying for special food and new clothes and had a female guard at her disposal and access to a private phone.      \\"She's being treated like any other inmate in her classification. There's no special treatment at all,\\" said Los Angeles sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore.      The \\"Freaky Friday\\" star was jailed Tuesday to serve a 90-day sentence for violating her probation by missing a string of alcohol education classes this year.      When she arrived in handcuffs and tears, prisoners yelled out her name and shouted, \\"God bless you!\\"      Lohan is expected to serve as little as two weeks because of good behavior and jail overcrowding.      On LiLo's second day behind bars, defense lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley stopped by for an hour-long visit, but didn't answer questions. Later in the day, Lohan's mom, Dina, and kid sister Ali showed up.      An exiting inmate said the jail was put on an hour lockdown for the visit.      \\"I sat there for four hours waiting to get released because of her,\\" said Sharell Gaines, 30, a Watts resident who spent a week in jail for traffic tickets. \\"They put us on lockdown and told us not to look. It's discrimination. She's a criminal, just like me.\\"      TMZ.com claimed that LiLo was given permission to take some prescription drugs while behind bars: the stimulant Adderall to treat attention deficit disorder and the sleeping pill Ambien.      Like all other inmates, she can spend up to 135 a week in the commissary for munchies like Spicy Velveeta Refried Beans, Spam, Kit Kat candy bars and Country Time Raspberry Lemonade, TMZ.com said.      sgoldsmith@nydailynews.com ||||| Michael Lohan is denying he kicked fiancé Kate Major in the face, RadarOnline.com is reporting.

Hayao Miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically (though his debut - Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best), 'Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta' AKA 'Castle in the Sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'Kiki's Delivery Service', 'Mononoke-hime' and 'Spirited Away', but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime. It's important to remember that 'Castle in the Sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'Akira', and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece, the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters, and the story is quite predictable and obvious (at least in today's standards), Miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before. While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times, the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable - if not as breathtaking as 'Spirited Away'. And if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low-budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning - you'll see Miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'Spirited Away' and Mononoke. While 'Castle in the Sky', being a sci-fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part. To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up. Suffice to say that I'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I couldn't go any higher for 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke'. And that would be a crime. As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous. You might want to watch it in the English version once, though, just for the laughs, and for the star-filled cast (the English dub was only recorded following the success of 'Spirited Away', as it was for 'Kiki's Delivery Service') - Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek (Yeah, the Dawson guy!) fill the lead roles, Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from 'Star Wars', in case you don't know!) plays the villain, and other roles are filled by Andy Dick, Tres MacNeille (The Simpsons, Rugrats, Animaniacs...), Michael McShane (Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner's Robin Hood travesty) and Mandy Patinkin (Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya...)

Between 301 and 219 BCE the Ptolemies ruled Judea in relative peace, and Jews often found themselves working in the Ptolemaic administration and army, which led to the rise of a Hellenized Jewish elite class (e.g. the Tobiads). The wars of Antiochus III brought the region into the Seleucid empire; Jerusalem fell to his control in 198 and the Temple was repaired and provided with money and tribute. Antiochus IV Epiphanes sacked Jerusalem and looted the Temple in 169 BCE after disturbances in Judea during his abortive invasion of Egypt. Antiochus then banned key Jewish religious rites and traditions in Judea. He may have been attempting to Hellenize the region and unify his empire and the Jewish resistance to this eventually led to an escalation of violence.

An announcer is paging Captain James (Douglas Lambert) as the ship he is piloting is leaving in just a few minutes. We see James enter a locker room where he starts to put on his spacesuit and we see another figure in a spacesuit lurking in the corner wearing a helmet so we can't see his face. James addresses the figure as Benson (Harvey Keitel). Benson has apparently just failed a mental stability exam and James is replacing him on this mission. Before James is finished putting on his suit, however, Benson straps himself down and opens the airlock venting the locker room. James is killed and his body flushed out into space. Benson closes the door and then takes James's place on the mission.Benson flies the ship through the rings of Saturn and lands it on a moon at the Saturn 3 experimental food station. It is a remote and isolated underground facility crewed by just two scientists: the older Adam (played by a 64 year-old Kirk Douglas) and the beautiful young Alex (played by a 33 year-old Farrah Fawcett). Despite their age difference the two are happy as lovers.Adam and Alex escort Benson inside the facility. Despite their warm greeting, Benson seems cold. He tells them they are behind schedule on developing the new food sources that the over-populated Earth desperately needs. He has brought a new robot - HECTOR - that he will assemble and program to help speed the project. Once Hector is operational he will be so effective that one of the scientists will no longer be needed.When Alex and Benson are alone, he makes it clear that he is interested in having sex with her. She tells him she is exclusively with Adam and Benson responds that on Earth it is considered inhospitable to refuse his request. Alex, who was born in space and has never visited Earth, though she is curious about it, points out that they are not on Earth and continues to ignore his advances. He, in turn, tells her that Adam is \\"obsolete.\\"Alex escorts Benson to his... The answer is:","output":"In the movie Saturn 3, Benson himself is the one who commits the murder. He kills Captain James at the beginning of the film by opening the airlock which causes James to be flushed out into space. Benson then proceeds to take James's place on the mission, leading him to the Saturn 3 experimental food station where he meets Adam and Alex, the two scientists working there. As the plot unfolds, it becomes clear that Benson is not mentally stable and poses a threat to both Adam and Alex. He assembles and programs a robot named HECTOR to help speed up the project, but also tells Alex that once HECTOR is operational, one of the scientists will no longer be needed, implying that he might have plans to get rid of one of them. Moreover, Benson displays unsettling behavior by making advances towards Alex despite her clear refusal. In summary, Benson is the murderer in the movie Saturn 3, having killed Captain James at the beginning of the film. His unstable behavior throughout the plot, as well as his interactions with Adam and Alex, further emphasize his dangerous nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The premise specifically mentions that the stupas of Sanchi are the most admired Buddhist monuments in the whole of India, which supports the hypothesis. To further expand on the hypothesis, it is important to understand the significance of the stupas of Sanchi and the reasons behind their admiration. The stupas of Sanchi are a group of Buddhist monuments located in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, approximately one hour away from the city of Bhopal. These monuments date back to the Mauryan Empire, which ruled India from the 4th to the 2nd century BCE. The stupas hold great historical and cultural significance, highlighting the architectural, artistic, and religious achievement of the era. The most famous stupa at Sanchi is the Great Stupa or Stupa 1. It was originally commissioned by Emperor Ashoka, a prominent Mauryan emperor, and a well-known patron of Buddhism. Over the centuries, the Great Stupa has been enlarged and embellished with various structures, including toranas (ornamental gateways), balustrades, and sculptural reliefs, which depict scenes from the life of the Buddha and the Jataka tales that describe the previous lives of the Buddha. The stupas of Sanchi are admired not only for their beautiful and intricate stone carvings but also as important symbols of the spread of Buddhism in India and other parts of Asia. The monuments exemplify the architectural achievements of the Mauryan period and display a rich amalgamation of artistic influences from across India. In addition, the stupas serve as a significant spiritual pilgrimage destination for Buddhists from around the world. Furthermore, the stupas of Sanchi have been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, further establishing their reputation as one of the most admired Buddhist monuments. This recognition is a testament to the historical, cultural, and artistic significance of these monuments, as well as their outstanding universal value. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The stupas of Sanchi are one of the most admired Buddhist monuments\\" is true, as demonstrated by the given premise. The stupas of Sanchi hold great historical and cultural significance and are considered to be the most admired Buddhist monuments in India.

Mental health experts claim that exercise is a solution to those feeling mild or moderate depression . However , for those severely depressed , simply doing sports is not enough . Use school counseling services : Campuses don't employ mental health experts simply to throw thousands of dollars down the drain . Their job is to help students , so experts recommend you use them . Most students , however , are hesitant to take a trip to their college's counseling center , fearing being laughed at by peers . As a result , some schools like Texas Christian University , are testing students for mental health problems when they get sick and visit the campus health clinic . Take advantage of technology : Staying in touch with family members and friends from childhood and high school has become easier than ever with the coming of Facebook and video chat services like Skype .

Please briefly summarize this news article: LaHood Sponsored Millions in Earmarks The former Republican congressman chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to direct billions in federal highway spending has been an unapologetic advocate of earmarks, a practice Obama now opposes, and has used his influence to win funding for projects pushed by some of his largest campaign contributors. Ray LaHood, who represented Illinois in the House for seven terms, sponsored 60 million in earmarks last year, steering at least 9 million in federal money to campaign donors, a Washington Post analysis shows. An opponent of earmark reform efforts in Congress, LaHood ranks roughly among the top 10 percent in the House for sponsoring earmarks in 2008, according to a watchdog group. LaHood's record poses an important question as hearings begin today that will explore how he would administer part of a 775 billion stimulus package that will be directed to the Transportation Department. LaHood has defended his use of earmarks as a way to direct federal money to decaying communities in his district and insisted there is no connection between his earmarks and projects benefiting campaign donors. Obama has pledged to resist pressure from local interests and to block unjustified earmarks from inclusion in the stimulus bill. \\"We're not having earmarks in the recovery package, period,\\" he said Jan. 7. The stimulus package would include the largest wave of federal transportation spending since the Eisenhower administration launched the creation of the interstate highway system. Transition spokesman Dan Leistikow credited LaHood for \\"14 years of honorable and outstanding service as a congressman, fighting on behalf of his constituents and creating jobs for working families.\\" LaHood, 62, a longtime member of the House Appropriations Committee until his retirement last month, declined to comment. Government watchdog groups say LaHood's selection does not bode well for Obama's pledge to return transparency to government spending. Earmarks are often last-minute insertions in federal spending bills and are not subject to normal reviews. LaHood also has been criticized for his ties to a longtime Republican state kingmaker in Illinois, William F. Cellini Sr., who was indicted in the \\"pay-to-play\\" criminal investigation underway by the office of Northern District U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald. Cellini has denied wrongdoing. \\"This guy has history of pork barrel spending and lot of a questionable spending linked to his friends. He's going to be in charge of funneling hundreds of billions of dollars into local projects . . . and he's not going to be suddenly changing his stripes tomorrow,\\" said Leslie Paige of the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste. LaHood's biggest campaign donor is Peoria's largest corporation: Caterpillar. The company and its workers have donated more than 190,000 to LaHood since 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Last year, LaHood secured 7.8 million to help the company and its offshoots develop technologies for potential future military contracts. Last year, he also pushed for 333,000 to construct the new Lakeview Museum in Peoria, part of a project that will include a Caterpillar-financed museum focused on the company's history. LaHood sponsored 1.49 million in earmarks directed to Springfield's Memorial Medical Center to fund the purchase of computer-based simulation technology and other equipment. Memorial and its lobbyist Cassidy and Associates together have given 60,000 to LaHood. Local road-building companies also have supported LaHood. United Contractors Midwest, led by president James Bruner, is often ranked as his second or third largest donor, and its officials have donated 24,925 to LaHood. Three leading members of the Illinois Asphalt Pavement Association have given more than 60,000 to LaHood. Last year, he proposed 2 million in road-paving projects, including at least one 245,000 check that the recipient never sought. The money would help an Illinois cemetery resurface its roadways. \\"Congressman LaHood's staff called me, saying, 'We know your roads are in bad condition. What can we do?' said LuAnn Johnson, executive director of the Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. \\"We were thrilled for the chance for federal dollars.\\" LaHood's road-building earmarks have highlighted his relationship with Cellini, head of the Illinois Asphalt Pavement Association and other businesses. Cellini was indicted in October on charges of shaking down government vendors to raise money for Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Cellini has longtime ties to Blagojevich and is accused in a separate civil lawsuit of striking a deal with the governor to raise money for him in exchange for control over key state jobs. In a Peoria newspaper article last year that celebrated his career, mayors cheered LaHood's earmarks, with one noting that \\"Ray's fingerprints are on everything around here.\\" LaHood defended using his sway to fund good, local ideas. \\"The reason I went on the Appropriations Committee, the reason other people go on the Appropriations Committee, is they know that it puts them in a position to know where the money is at, to know the people who are doling out the money and to be in the room when the money is being doled out,\\" he said. Some beneficiaries are little known outside the district. LaHood sponsored more than 1 million in earmarks to build a Peoria/NEXT incubator, a technology development project. A Morton, Ill.-based firm, Otto Baum, was chosen in 2006 to build part of the center. The firm wrote LaHood a 2,300 campaign check last year. LaHood also has advocated for the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, which relied upon 40 million in federal funds. He sponsored a 5 million earmark in 2004 to finish the building. Staff researchers Julie Tate and Madonna Lebling contributed to this report.","output":"The article discusses how Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to direct federal highway spending, has been an advocate of earmarks, a practice Obama now opposes.

It won't do much to give your hair extra volume, but it will protect your hair from heat damage, and prevent it from turning brittle and dry. Be sure to focus the heat protectant on the ends of your hair, which tend to get damaged the easiest. Plan on straightening your hair in at least three layers. If you have very thick hair, or just a lot of it, you will have to work in thinner sections. Take a small, 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) section of hair, and clamp your iron over it, as close as you can to your scalp without burning yourself. Instead of pulling the iron straight down, pull it upwards towards the ceiling by a few inches/centimeters. When you get halfway across your hair, pull the iron away from your head. Pulling the iron upwards helps create volume, while pulling it away makes it easier on your arm. If your hair is too hot for you to touch, use a hairbrush to handle it. It might also be a good sign that your hair straightener is set to too high of a temperature; you might want to lower the temperature a little. Once you are done, you can move on to the next layer, or gently tease your hair first. If you choose to tease your hair, give it a quick spray with a flexible hairspray to set the style while allowing movement and flow. Always work in layers and small sections. Remember, the thicker your hair is, the more layers you will have to work with. Run your fingers upwards through your hair, starting at the roots. This will give your hair that final lift it needs. If you want to, give your hair a spray with some texturizing hairspray.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? On average, lettuce takes about 30-45 days after you plant the seeds to mature. Make a note on your calendar to begin harvesting after about 30 days has passed.  Indoor lettuce plants grow and mature continually, so you can continue harvesting your plant after you've picked it for the first time. Mature indoor lettuce usually grows to about 4 inches (10 cm) tall. See How to Harvest Romaine Lettuce for specific instructions relating to this type of lettuce. Morning is when your plant's most hydrated and at its strongest. If possible, harvest your plant before the late morning or afternoon to attain a healthier yield. If you can't harvest in the morning, avoid mid-to-late afternoon, which is when your plant's least hydrated. Do not harvest your indoor lettuce plant all at once. As long as you continue taking care of it, you can harvest it for several months. Cut 3-4 of the outer leaves at a time with garden shears or scissors, leaving the rest of the plant to heal and grow back later on. Avoid picking the lettuce's crown or center. Limit yourself to the outer leaves to boost its overall harvesting yield. Depending on the variety, lettuce can last anywhere between 3-10 days in the refrigerator. Check how long your specific variety lasts for and, after placing the lettuce in the fridge, plan to use it by its expiration date. If you don't think you'll use your lettuce in 5-8 days, wait a few days before harvesting your plant. Your plant requires about 2 weeks to heal and grow more leaves before it is ready to harvest again. After your first time harvesting, wait 2 weeks in-between harvesting to keep your plant healthy and able to grow more leaves.  Wait at least 2 weeks before harvesting young plants, which may take time to grow strong after being harvested. Sow additional seeds every 2 weeks to extend your harvest.","output":"This article explains how to maintain and harvest indoor lettuce plants, discussing optimal harvest times, the best methods for picking leaves, and maintaining plant health to achieve a steady supply of fresh lettuce for an extended period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The gate at Nelson Mandela Place in the city centre was put in place by Glasgow City Council at the end of June 2014. Nearly 70,000 charge notices were issued to car drivers between then and the end of July this year. But, more than a third of those fined have not paid up. Councils say the gates aid public transport efficiency. The fines paid by drivers who used the single bus gate during its first year were greater than the total amount of bus gate and bus lane fines in both Edinburgh and Aberdeen in 2013. Cars were banned from driving through Nelson Mandela Place - close to Buchanan Street, George Square and Queen Street railway station - in a bid to help cut down on traffic in that part of the city centre. Taxis, delivery vehicles, buses and emergency vehicles are still allowed. Initially some drivers complained that the move was not well publicised and claimed the signs warning of the bus gate were inadequate. Some also wrongly assumed that the gate was a temporary measure during the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. If a motorist issued with a notice pays up within 14 days, they are charged £30 - and most do pay up within a fortnight. If they pay up later, they are charged £60. Councils across Scotland are adamant bus gates are only put in place to help the environment and public transport, and strongly deny claims from opponents that they are a source of revenue. Even the £1.3m from Nelson Mandela Place is still a drop in the ocean compared to Glasgow City Council's annual budget of more than £2bn. In July and August last year, 30,000 notices were issued to motorists. The number then fell substantially in September to 5,000 and has gradually declined since. Approximately 10,000 notices were served between April and July this year - 2,334 of them last month. If all the motorists who received a notice last month pay up within 30 days, the fines will total £70,000. Councillor Alistair Watson, Glasgow City Council's executive member for Sustainability and Transport, said: \\"One of the aims of the bus gate is to reduce the number of vehicles travelling through the city centre, while improving provision for public transport. \\"There is always a period of adjustment when new restrictions are introduced. It's clear from the reduction in offences that drivers are aware of the bus lanes and have modified the route they take. \\"The majority of the city's drivers won't receive bus lane charges since they don't drive through what is now a well-known and very visible bus gate. \\"The number of offences has dropped significantly and hopefully we will see even further reductions. Most drivers contravening the bus gate pay the penalty within 14 days which reduces their fine to £30.\\" In 2013, Edinburgh City Council received £718,000 from bus lane fines while Aberdeen City Council received £896,000. That year Glasgow received a total of £3,283,776.","output":"In June 2014, Glasgow City Council installed a bus gate at Nelson Mandela Place to reduce traffic in the city center, allowing only buses, taxis, delivery vehicles, and emergency vehicles to pass. Despite issuing nearly 70,000 charge notices to car drivers by the end of July this year, more than a third remain unpaid. The council argues the bus gate improves public transportation efficiency, and payments from fines in the gate's first year were higher than those for bus gate and lane fines in Edinburgh and Aberdeen combined in 2013. Initially, some drivers complained about inadequate publicity and signage concerning the bus gate, with some incorrectly assuming it was a temporary measure during the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. A motorist issued within a notice has 14 days to pay a £30 charge, and most do comply within that time frame. If a driver pays after two weeks, they face a £60 charge. Scottish councils insist that bus gates are installed for the sake of the environment and public transport, not as a revenue source. The £1.3 million collected from Nelson Mandela Place is dwarfed by Glasgow City Council's £2 billion annual budget. The number of notices given to motorists peaked at 30,000 last year during July and August, decreasing to 5,000 in September and continuing to decline gradually, with approximately 10,000 notices given between April and July this year.

Imagine you have a seesaw, and right now it's perfectly balanced because it's at 0. We want to add and remove some weights (represented by h) to find out how much to balance it again. Here's the math part, don't worry, we'll do it together: 0 = -39h + 137h - 1176 First, we need to add the weights with h in them. So we add -39h and 137h. Think of it like this: you have 137 toys but someone takes away 39 toys from you. You do 137 - 39, and you have 98 toys. So now, our balance looks like this: 0 = 98h - 1176 Next, we need to find out how many 98s are hidden inside the 1176. To do this, we'll add 1176 to both sides of the balance and then divide both sides by 98. It's like making equal groups with all the toys we have. When we do this, we find out we have: (0 + 1176) / 98 = 1176 / 98 12 = h So, our final answer is that h is equal to 12.

Had the original casting idea been kept (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie might have worked. Sadly, racism had to come into the picture (literally) and mess it up. The predominantly black production staff couldn't allow the antagonist be black, so they swapped Rutger's and Ice-T's roles. This was only the start of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's news-room approach to 'directing' only verified that this was another affirmative-action job assignment. Master shot, close up, close up. Gads, 'Who's Line Is It Anyway' even uses more creative camera work.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  At the time of the transfer of power, the state of Jammu and Kashmir (widely called \\"Kashmir\\") was ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh, a Hindu, although the state itself had a Muslim majority. Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions.

In Czech, the word \\"jen\\" usually comes right after the verb it refers to, and the auxiliary verb \\"by\\" is placed before the subject. - \\"otevřel dveře\\" translates to \\"opened the door\\": \\"otevřel\\" is the past tense masculine singular form of the Czech verb \\"otevřít\\" (to open), and \\"dveře\\" means \\"the door\\" in plural form, which is standard usage in Czech, even when referring to just one door. - \\"byl by\\" means \\"he would be\\" and is a conditional tense construction in Czech, combining the past participle \\"byl\\" (was) with the conditional auxiliary \\"by.\\" - \\"navždy\\" means \\"forever\\" or \\"for good,\\" implying the permanency of the situation. - \\"pryč\\" means \\"gone\\" or \\"away.\\" So, in the context of the sentence, the Czech translation \\"Pokud by jen otevřel dveře, byl by navždy pryč\\" captures the original meaning and nuance of the English sentence, effectively conveying the idea that opening the door would result in a permanent departure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She climbed the tree in the rain, but not in the wind, because the","output":"wind made the branches sway unpredictably. The raindrops fell softly upon her face, an orchestra of droplets serenading her as she ascended. With each step, she felt more connected to the tree, its wooden limbs offering support and solace in her time of need. Step 1: Remember the context for the next part of the story. In this story, the protagonist is climbing a tree in the rain, feeling a connection with tree and nature as she climbs higher. Step 2: Determine the main character's goal or purpose for climbing the tree. Considering the actions and emotions of the protagonist, it's essential to understand why she is doing this. Maybe she is looking for a place to think or seeking an escape from the outside world. Step 3: Develop the protagonist's thoughts and feelings. As she climbed higher, she looked down at the increasingly distant ground below, the concerns of her earthly life fading into insignificance. Surrounded by the gentle rustling of leaves, she embraced the sense of isolation that came with her height. This tree was her sanctuary, where she could leave her worries behind. Step 4: Introduce an external factor that affects the main character. As she reached the upper branches of the tree, she noticed a small bird's nest tucked away between two limbs. Inside, a baby bird was struggling against the cold rain, its mother nowhere to be seen. Step 5: Show the protagonist's response to this external factor. A wave of compassion washed over her, and she knew she couldn't leave this tiny creature to face the storm alone. She delicately lifted the shivering bird and tucked it close to her chest, providing warmth and protection. Step 6: Build the character's connection to this external factor. With their shared experience of finding refuge in the tree, a bond began to form between the girl and the baby bird. She couldn't help but think that their lives mirrored one another in some way - both seeking shelter from their respective storms. Step 7: Create a resolution or realization for the protagonist. As she carefully climbed back down the tree with the tiny bird still pressed to her chest, she realized that they were both stronger than their adversities. The tree, in all its steadfastness, had taught her an invaluable lesson - that even in the face of the harshest storms, she had the strength to stand tall and endure, just as the tree did. Step 8: Conclude the story by connecting back to the beginning. She reached the ground, the rain still falling softly around her. With a new sense of determination, she vowed to carry this lesson with her always, walking away from the tree with a renewed resilience, ready to face whatever storms life had in store for her."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The sentence in question displays a critical tone towards Godard's vision, employing language that represents a negative perspective. The use of words such as \\"slack complacency,\\" \\"tinny self-righteousness,\\" and \\"cannot disguise\\" reveal an unfavorable assessment of both Godard's vision and the soundtrack associated with it. In breaking down the sentence further, we can observe several negative elements: 1. \\"Slack complacency\\": The word \\"slack\\" suggests a lack of energy or effort, while \\"complacency\\" refers to self-satisfaction, often without merit. This phrase implies that Godard's vision is perceived as lazy and unwarranted in its confidence. 2. \\"Cannot disguise\\": This phrase implies that some attempts were made to hide the faults in Godard's vision but have ultimately failed. 3. \\"Gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack\\": This part of the sentence introduces a contrasting element—the beautiful music associated with the project. However, the beauty of the music is then negated by its inability to override or \\"drown out\\" the negative aspects of Godard's vision. 4. \\"Tinny self-righteousness of his voice\\": Using the word \\"tinny\\" to describe Godard's voice accentuates its unpleasant nature, while \\"self-righteousness\\" further emphasizes the sense of unjustified confidence or superiority in his vision.

The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758.

The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\".

I hadn't heard much about it; only that it was a tightly-paced thriller, shot digitally on a very low budget. I was hoping to catch the next big Brit-Flick. But I have to say, I was severely disappointed. \\"This Is Not A Love Song\\" follows two criminals, who, after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer's young daughter, become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down. The real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a British film. The camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story, as are the over the top performances, and the appalling use of slow motion, which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video. There are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty, which instead come over as hilarious and over the top(Cue a pathetic, obligatory drug scene, and countless, pointless camera zooms). No amount of cliche's such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story. We've seen this kind of thing many times before, and made a hundred times better, particularly in John Boorman's masterful \\"Deliverance.\\" But while in the latter film, we actually cared about the characters, in this film, I found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible. Even this wouldn't have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile, but instead, are merely a collection of stereotypical, inbred-looking countryfolk. Again, another offensive, overused cliche' coming to the fore. Surely there are some nice people in the country, filmmakers? In its defense, \\"This Is Not A Love Song\\" does contain a couple of good, suspenseful moments, but it's hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video, or, at a push, getting a very limited cinema release. It's not a patch on last year's Low-Budget hunted in the hills movie, \\"Dog soldiers\\".

Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - CoRoT (French: ; English: COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits) is a space observatory mission led by the French Space Agency (CNES) in conjunction with the European Space Agency (ESA) and other international partners. The mission's two objectives are to search for extrasolar planets with short orbital periods, particularly those of large terrestrial size, and to perform asteroseismology by measuring solar-like oscillations in stars.  - CoRoT ( French : COnvection ROtation et Transits planétaires ; English : COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits ) is a space mission led by the French Space Agency ( CNES ) in conjunction with the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and other international partners . The mission 's two objectives are to search for extrasolar planets with short orbital periods , particularly those of large terrestrial size , and to perform asteroseismology by measuring solar - like oscillations in stars . It was launched at 14:28:00 UTC on 27 December 2006 , atop a Soyuz 2.1b carrier rocket , reporting first light on 18 January 2007 . Subsequently , the probe started to collect science data on 2 February 2007 . CoRoT is the first spacecraft dedicated to the detection of transiting extrasolar planets , opening the way for more advanced probes such as Kepler as well as future missions such as TESS and PLATO . It detected its first extrasolar planet , COROT - 1b , in May 2007 , just 3 months after the start of the observations . Mission flight operations were originally scheduled to end 2.5 years from launch but operations were extended to 2013 . On 2 November 2012 , CoRoT suffered a computer failure that made it impossible to retrieve any data from its telescope . After repair attempts , on 24 June 2013 , it was announced that CoRoT has been retired and would be decommissioned ; lowered in orbit to allow it to burn up in the atmosphere .  - Asteroseismology is the study of oscillations in stars. Because a star's different oscillation modes are sensitive to different parts of the star, they inform astronomers about the internal structure of the star, which is otherwise not directly possible from overall properties like brightness and surface temperature. Asteroseismology is closely related to helioseismology, the study of stellar oscillations specifically in the Sun. Though both are based on the same underlying physics, more and qualitatively different information is available for the Sun because its surface can be resolved.  - Oscillation is the repetitive variation, typically in time, of some measure about a central value (often a point of equilibrium) or between two or more different states. The term \\"vibration\\" is precisely used to describe mechanical oscillation. Familiar examples of oscillation include a swinging pendulum and alternating current power.  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - Solar-like oscillations are oscillations in distant stars that are excited in the same way as those in the Sun, namely by turbulent convection in its outer layers. Stars that show solar-like oscillations are called solar-like oscillators. The oscillations are standing pressure and mixed pressure-gravity modes that are excited over a range in frequency, with the amplitudes roughly following a bell-shaped distribution. Unlike opacity-driven oscillators, all the modes in the frequency range are excited, making the oscillations relatively easy to identify. The surface convection also damps the modes, and each is well-approximated in frequency space by a Lorentzian curve, the width of which corresponds to the lifetime of the mode: the faster it decays, the broader is the Lorentzian. All stars with surface convection zones are expected to show solar-like oscillations, including cool main-sequence stars (up to surface temperatures of about 7000K), subgiants and red giants. Because of the small amplitudes of the oscillations, their study has advanced tremendously thanks to space-based missions (mainly COROT and Kepler).  - Helioseismology is the study of the propagation of wave oscillations, particularly acoustic pressure waves, in the Sun. Unlike seismic waves on Earth, solar waves have practically no shear component (s-waves). Solar pressure waves are believed to be generated by the turbulence in the convection zone near the surface of the sun. Certain frequencies are amplified by constructive interference. In other words, the turbulence \\"rings\\" the sun like a bell. The acoustic waves are transmitted to the outer photosphere of the sun, which is where the light generated through absorption of radiant energy from nuclear fusion at the centre of the sun, leaves the surface. These oscillations are detectable on almost any time series of solar images, but are best observed by measuring the Doppler shift of photospheric absorption lines.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the full names of the people who leave their spouses and move into an apartment together?, using the article: Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face. The event, adorned by giant images of African famine victims, is at the height of cynical hypocrisy and bad taste, showing Diana's rich white set, which now includes the establishment, playing at concern, gorging themselves, gambling and generally behaving decadently.

Constipation is not a glamorous topic, but it’s certainly important, especially in older adults. As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you play tag?","output":"Playing tag is a simple, fun, and engaging game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is an ideal activity for socializing, developing physical fitness, and honing motor skills. To play tag, you will require a group of players, ideally consisting of at least 3 or more participants, and a suitable outdoor or indoor area where everyone can move around safely. Here is a detailed guide on how to play tag: 1. Choose a location: Find a spacious and safe area to play the game, such as a park, backyard, playground, or a gymnasium. The location should provide enough space for the players to move around freely and comfortably. Make sure to clear any potential hazards or obstacles that might cause injuries. 2. Gather participants: Invite a group of friends, family members, or classmates to join the game. As mentioned earlier, having at least 3 participants is recommended, but tag can be played with a larger group for added excitement and entertainment. 3. Set boundaries: Determine the playing area by marking its boundaries. This can be done using cones, rope, or a natural landmark, like a tree or a fence. Inform all players of the designated boundaries, and ensure that they understand the importance of staying within the playing area throughout the game. 4. Select a 'tagger': One person in the group will begin as the 'tagger' or 'it.' This individual is responsible for chasing and trying to tag other players. The selection of the first 'tagger' can be done through various methods such as a random draw, a vote, or a quick game of rock-paper-scissors. 5. Explain the rules: Before starting the game, make sure all participants understand the rules of tag. They are:    - The tagger's objective is to touch or 'tag' another player.    - When a player is tagged, they become the new 'tagger' and must now chase and tag other players.    - Players cannot tag the person who just tagged them (also known as \\"no tag-backs\\" rule).    - If a player accidentally steps outside the designated boundaries, they will become the new 'tagger.'    - The game continues until everyone agrees to stop playing, or a predetermined time limit or number of rounds have been reached. 6. Begin the game: The first tagger will count down from a predetermined number (usually 10 or 20) out loud, during which time the other players will scatter around the playing area. Once the countdown is finished, the tagger will shout 'Go!' or 'Tag!' to signal the start of the game. 7. Play and tag: The tagger will now chase after the other players in an attempt to tag them. Players must avoid being tagged by running, dodging or using other evasive maneuvers. The tagged player will become the new tagger, and the game goes on. 8. Implement variations (optional): To make the game more interesting, you can introduce different variations such as:    - Freeze Tag: When a player is tagged, they must freeze in place until another player touches them and 'unfreezes' them.    - Shadow Tag: Instead of tagging players by touching them, the tagger must step on their shadow. This version works best on sunny days.    - Chain Tag: As players are tagged, they join hands with the tagger, forming a chain. The chain must remain intact while trying to tag other players. 9. End the game: The game concludes when all players decide to stop playing, a predetermined time limit has been reached, or a designated number of rounds have been played. At the end of the game, players can discuss their favorite moments and congratulate each other on their efforts. By following these steps, you can enjoy a fun and active game of tag with your friends or family members. The simplicity of the game allows for various modifications and adaptations, making it suitable to cater to the preferences and abilities of different age groups and fitness levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   In which location the Geiger counter would click, location A or location C?  Keith landed a job with the EPA. As part of his training he needed to learn how the Geiger counter works. To learn more about the counter he tested it in three different locations, location A, location B, and location C. Location A had very high radiation; location B had low radiation; and location C didn't have any radiation. Keith learned how the counter works in locations with varying degrees of radiation.  Hint: You generally can’t see, smell, taste, hear, or feel radiation. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure below , contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. A:","output":"The Geiger counter would click at location A. The paragraph describes how a Geiger counter operates by detecting radiation, and it generates a clicking sound when it encounters radiation. Keith tested it in three locations.

Since the Geiger counter responds to the presence of radiation, it would click in areas where radiation is present.

After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations.  Which path will be marched over less frequently?  Hint: In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication).  Over time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8] A:","output":"Based on the given information, path A will be marched over more frequently due to its shorter length. This is because the ants following the pheromone trails will reach the food source and return to the colony more quickly, reinforcing the pheromone trail.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Freedom from Want was published with an essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be \\"given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities\\", an echo of Karl Marx's \\"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\".  In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase \\"The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world\\" describes an egalitarian America.  In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as \\"haunting and sharp\\" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty.

Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses. Many years later, Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and then entering Egypt into an alliance with them. Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka.

Here are possible answers to this question: - theater - airplane - theatre - new york city - fieldhouse  I believe the correct choice is \\"fieldhouse\\", here's why:","output":"A catwalk is unlikely to be in a fieldhouse because of the following reasons: 1. Purpose of a catwalk: A catwalk is a narrow, elevated platform or walkway typically found in theaters, concert venues, and fashion shows, where they are used as a stage for models. It serves as an access point for stagehands and technicians to manage elements such as lighting, sound, and rigging in these settings. 2. The nature of a fieldhouse: A fieldhouse is an indoor facility designed for sports and recreational activities. It typically houses courts for basketball, volleyball, and various other indoor sports, as well as tracks, fitness centers, and sometimes even swimming pools. The primary purpose of a fieldhouse is to provide a space for physical activities, not performance arts or fashion shows. Comparing the other options: - Theater and theatre are essentially the same, referring to a venue where plays, musicals, and other performance arts are held. Catwalks are commonly found in these locations. - Airplane: A catwalk would not typically be found on an airplane, but this option isn't relevant, as the context of a catwalk implies being in a location where it serves a specific purpose, such as a theater or fashion show stage. - New York City: As a major city, New York has many theaters, venues, and fashion events where catwalks are present.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which team had fewer runners with muscle weakness?  Two teams of runners took part in a study about exercise. Red team ran 10 km in the heat, while Green team ran the same distance in the morning in cool weather. The Red team experienced more runners with health problems.  Hint: Millions of people in the world jog for exercise. For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. Answer:","output":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, the Green team had fewer runners with muscle weakness. This analysis can be reached by considering the specific circumstances in which both teams operated and the potential health issues linked with each situation. The paragraph indicates that the Red team ran 10 km in the heat, while the Green team ran the same distance in the morning in cool weather. Also mentioned is the fact that the Red team experienced more runners with health problems, whereas no specific health issues were pointed out for the Green team. The hint provided further substantiates this conclusion. It underlines that jogging can be a healthy exercise, but it can also lead to issues if done in the heat. This is due to the excessive sweating caused by hot conditions, which can result in serious electrolyte loss. The early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatigue, dizziness, muscle weakness, and increased heart rate, potentially leading to a heart attack. Given that the Red team was running in the heat, they would have been more likely to experience these symptoms, especially muscle weakness, which is directly tied to electrolyte deficiency. On the contrary, the Green team ran in cool weather, which should have resulted in less excessive sweating and, consequently, a lower likelihood of experiencing electrolyte deficiency and its related symptoms. Furthermore, the paragraph does not mention whether the Red team consumed any sports drinks to restore their electrolytes quickly. In contrast, the Green team, running in cooler conditions, would likely have sweated less and retained a more balanced electrolyte level, reducing the likelihood of muscle weakness.  In conclusion, based on the given information and suggested implications, it can be stated that the Green team had fewer runners experiencing muscle weakness than the Red team."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her mother, Catrine (nee Gallo), is Italian American (from Sicily). Lauper's siblings are younger brother Fred (nicknamed Butch), and older sister, Ellen. Lauper's parents divorced when she was five. Her mother remarried and divorced again.  Lauper grew up in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens and, as a child, listened to such artists as The Beatles, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland and Billie Holiday. At age 12, she began writing songs and playing an acoustic guitar given to her by her sister.  Lauper expressed herself with a variety of hair colors, eccentric clothing and even took a friend's advice to spell her name as \\"Cyndi\\" rather than \\"Cindy\\".  Lauper went to Richmond Hill High School, but was expelled, although she later earned her GED. She left home at 17, to escape her abusive stepfather, intending to study art. Her journey took her to Canada, where she spent two weeks in the woods with her dog Sparkle, trying to find herself. She eventually traveled to Vermont, where she took art classes at Johnson State College and supported herself working odd jobs.  In the early 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various cover bands. One, called Doc West, covered disco songs as well as Janis Joplin. A later band, Flyer, was active in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands including Bad Company, Jefferson Airplane and Led Zeppelin. Although Lauper was performing on stage, she was not happy singing covers. In 1977, Lauper damaged her vocal cords and took a year off from singing.

Answer the following question: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

As the thick, fragrant cloud began to permeate every corner of the space, it became apparent that something needed to be done. Step 1: Assess the situation First, it was crucial to determine the severity of the problem and identify if anyone was in immediate danger. Acute symptoms of exposure to excessive incense smoke include coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions may be more vulnerable to the effects. Step 2: Open windows and doors In order to improve the air circulation in the room and help dissipate the dense smoke, all windows and doors needed to be opened. This would allow fresh air to enter the space and provide relief for those affected by the heavy fumes. Step 3: Turn off the incense To prevent the situation from becoming worse, it was essential to stop the source of the smoke. By extinguishing the incense or removing it from the room, the risk of further irritation or health complications would be minimized. Step 4: Use fans to speed up air circulation If available, portable fans could be strategically placed near windows and doorways to help accelerate the flow of fresh air and disperse the remaining smoke more quickly. Step 5: Monitor and attend to affected individuals As the air cleared, it was crucial to check on those who had exhibited symptoms or discomfort due to the incense smoke. If anyone appeared to be struggling or in distress, it might be necessary to seek medical attention. Step 6: Implement safety measures for future gatherings To avoid a similar incident from occurring in the future, understanding the importance of proper ventilation and regulating the use of incense during gatherings would be essential. Knowing the appropriate quantity of incense to use and ensuring adequate air circulation could prevent such issues from arising again. Through swift and well-thought-out actions, we managed to resolve the situation and restore a more comfortable environment for everyone in the room.

Founded in 1989, the company developed products for home video game consoles and handhelds, personal computers and mobile devices. Its name derived from \\"Toy Headquarters\\" during its time as a toy manufacturer in the early 1990s. THQ had offices in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.  - A toy is an item that is generally used for children's play. Playing with toys is supposed to be an enjoyable means of training young children for life in society. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Many items are designed to serve as toys, but goods produced for other purposes can also be used. For instance, a small child may fold an ordinary piece of paper into an airplane shape and \\"fly it.\\"  Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment. Some toys are produced primarily as collector's items and are intended for display only.   - Formula One (also Formula 1 or F1 and officially the FIA Formula One World Championship) is the highest class of single-seat auto racing that is sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).

It actually does give a healthy natural looking glow that doesn't look orange. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: What generates gamma radiation Suggested answer: Legend Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"When verifying the validity of an answer generated by an automatic system, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the topic at hand. In this case, the question pertains to the generation of gamma radiation. Gamma radiation falls under the category of electromagnetic radiation and is characterized by its high energy and short wavelength. It is the most energetic and penetrating type of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma radiation is typically produced by various nuclear reactions, atomic transitions, and high-energy astrophysical phenomena. The suggested answer, \\"Legend,\\" is not appropriate for the given question. A more accurate response would be to explain the main sources and processes that generate gamma radiation. These include: 1. Radioactive decay: Gamma radiation is often produced when atomic nuclei undergo a process known as radioactive decay. During decay, unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation in the form of gamma rays. Commonly known radioactive materials, such as uranium and plutonium, can emit gamma radiation due to their unstable isotopes. 2. Nuclear reactions: Gamma rays can also be generated through nuclear reactions such as nuclear fission and fusion processes. In nuclear fission, heavy atomic nuclei, like those of uranium and plutonium, are split into lighter nuclei, which release gamma radiation along with other particles like neutrons. On the other hand, nuclear fusion, which occurs in stars like the Sun, involves the joining of lighter atomic nuclei to form heavier isotopes, and this process can also emit gamma radiation. 3. Cosmic phenomena: Gamma rays are generated in cosmic events such as supernovae, black holes, and active galactic nuclei. Supernovae are massive explosions that result from the dying of massive stars and involve the release of vast amounts of energy, including gamma radiation. Active galactic nuclei, like quasars and blazars, are known to emit gamma rays as a result of the high-energy processes occurring in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. 4. Particle interactions: Gamma radiation can also be created during the interaction of high-energy particles. For example, when cosmic rays (high-energy particles from space) collide with the Earth's atmosphere, they can produce high-energy photons in the form of gamma rays. In conclusion, the suggested answer, \\"Legend,\\" should not be validated as a correct response to the question about what generates gamma radiation. Instead, a more accurate and detailed answer should encompass the various sources and processes that produce gamma radiation, including radioactive decay, nuclear reactions, cosmic phenomena, and particle interactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even if you want to..I am anonymous for the same reason. So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better.

It's unfortunate that your condition was misinterpreted for many years, however, in spite of it all, you persevered and continued seeking for answers, a testament to your resilience. It’s heart-rending to think that it took about fifteen years for you to have a correct diagnosis, a period during which the medical professionals you saw came up with completely unrelated diagnoses, like growth spurts or a supposed attention-seeking behavior. This points to an important fact: sometimes, healthcare professionals may overlook unfamiliar symptoms or interpret them incorrectly due to the vast array of possible health conditions, their limited knowledge of rare conditions, time constraints, and perhaps a certain level of bias in their diagnostic thinking.  However, the day came when you were finally sent to a neurologist and you got correctly diagnosed with ice pick headaches. The relief you felt was not only physical but also emotional – the vindication of finally receiving a correct diagnosis, acknowledgement, and the promise of a possible solution to chronic pain. It’s understandable that this was a profound moment in your life, one that brought instant relief and renewed hopes for a healthier life. Your decision to start taking a beta blocker as treatment for ice pick headaches speaks to the importance of appropriate and targeted interventions in managing health conditions. This medication has proved to significantly change your life for the better, substantially reducing the frequency and severity of your headaches. It has also given you the freedom to consider things like learning to drive, an activity that was initially a big concern for you due to the sudden onset and potentially debilitating impact of the headaches. All these changes in your life underscore the transformative power of a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatments. Furthermore, your experiences point out the importance of self-advocacy in healthcare. Patients have to be active participants in their own healthcare, continually pushing for a correct diagnosis, and appropriate treatment. Your story is undoubtedly an encouragement to others experiencing similar puzzling symptoms to persist in seeking answers. It also emphasizes the importance of a proper dialogue between doctors and patients, and the necessity for healthcare professionals to invest quality time in reaching an accurate diagnosis. Your story acts as a beacon of hope, demonstrating that, with the right diagnosis and correct treatment, it’s entirely possible to significantly improve quality of life, even with a challenging and rare condition like ice-pick headaches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For years China has been under a sea of rotting plastic bags , billions casually dumped every year . Since June this year , this tide of garbage had begun to ebb . How would the narrator be described in light of these comments ?","output":"The narrator could be described as observant, informed, analytical, hopeful, and environmentally-conscious in light of these comments. Here's why: Observant: The narrator presents information about China's long-standing issue with plastic waste, pointing out that the problem has persisted \\"for years\\". This suggests that they have been watching the situation closely over a sustained period of time. Thus, we can regard them as vigilant and perceptive. Informed: The specifics provided—for instance, stating that \\"billions\\" of plastic bags are \\"casually dumped every year\\"—indicate that the narrator is well-educated on the matter under discussion. They employ precise data to substantiate their statements, which shows a commitment to accuracy and research.  Analytical: The narrator's ability to identify \\"positive changes\\" in the transitioning situation demonstrates an analytical instinct. Rather than sticking to the narration of facts, they interpret these facts to evaluate an overall emergent pattern, exemplifying their analytical prowess. Hopeful: The recognition of positivity in an otherwise bleak context—that is, acknowledging that the \\"tide of garbage had begun to ebb\\" despite the copious amounts of waste produced over the years—suggests a hopeful perspective. The narrator seems to believe in the possibility of progress and transformation, no matter how slow or difficult. Environmentally-Conscious: The fact that the narrator focuses on the issue of plastic waste implies a concern for the environment. Their discussion of the problem and its gradual resolution reveals a commitment to and investment in ecological issues. They are aware of humanity's role in creating environmental distress and therefore, likely advocates corrective measures. In summary, based on these comments, one might depict the narrator as a vigilant observer and well-informed analyst who, despite facing the adversity of environmental issues, maintains a hopeful outlook while demonstrating a thoughtful concern for the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks?\\"  Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

It is a living cloud made of billions of locusts   and they are eating everything in their path. And now in order to fight against this disaster, a radio station in Senegal, West Africa, is offering listeners 5 kilograms of rice if they can catch and kill 50 kilograms of locusts. \\"We think this idea will get more people to take part in the fight against the locusts,\\" said Abdoulaye Ba, from Sud-Fm, a radio station in one of Senegal's worst affected area. This is West Africa's biggest locust disaster in 15 years. Now it is moving east and it leads to the loss of crops. When they move, they have babies, so their number is getting bigger. and will soon threaten   Sudan in the northeast of Africa. Some say it may reach Asia. Experts say many people in the areas will go hungry because of this disaster. What's worse, governments in the areas don't have enough things to fight the locusts. Although leaders of 12 countries have agreed on a plan, it is not enough. 'We are now treating 6,000 hectares   per day with pesticide  , but we need to treat 20,000 hectares per day in order to have any hope of controlling this disaster,' said Mohamed Abdallahi Ould Babah, leader of locust control  in Mauritania.

The story primarily focuses on the ongoing battle against a massive locust invasion in West Africa, which has become the largest locust disaster in the region in 15 years. These swarms of locusts are causing significant damage to crops and increasing the risk of hunger for many people in the affected areas. Radio stations like Sud-Fm in Senegal have started initiatives to encourage people to participate in efforts to combat the locusts; for example, offering 5 kilograms of rice as a reward for catching and killing 50 kilograms of locusts. However, the scale of the problem is immense, and the governments in the region lack the resources and adequate plans to effectively combat the locust swarms. Twelve countries have agreed upon a plan to address the disaster, but it is still not sufficient to control the situation. According to Mohamed Abdallahi Ould Babah, the leader of locust control in Mauritania, the efforts to treat affected areas with pesticides must be significantly increased to have any hope of containing the swarms and limiting the damage they cause. As the locust swarms continue moving eastward, there are concerns that they may soon threaten Sudan in northeastern Africa and even potentially reach Asia.

Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity.  and a hint : Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior.  Please answer this question : Which island displayed more seismic waves? Answer:","output":"The Large island displayed more seismic waves. In this situation, a team of geologists studied two islands – the Large island with a lot of seismic activity and the Small island with almost no seismic activity. The hint provided gives us an insight into how geologists study seismic waves to understand Earth's interior. Seismic waves are essentially waves of energy that radiate from an earthquake's focus and propagate through the Earth. These waves can be useful in determining the different materials that make up the Earth's interior by observing their behavior and interactions with various materials. Now, since the Large island has a lot of seismic activity, it indicates that there are more frequent earthquakes occurring on this island. This, in turn, implies that there will be more seismic waves generated and observed by geologists studying the island. These seismic waves will allow them to better understand the Earth's interior beneath the Large island and possibly provide more information about the tectonic activity or other geological factors that contribute to the increased seismic activity on this island. Conversely, the Small island presents almost no seismic activity, which implies that there are very few, if any, earthquakes happening on this island. As a result, fewer seismic waves are being generated and observed by the geologists in their studies of this island. This could suggest that the tectonic or geological conditions on the Small island are more stable than those on the Large island, leading to its low seismic activity. In conclusion, the Large island displayed more seismic waves due to its increased seismic activity, providing geologists with valuable information about the Earth's interior and the geological factors contributing to the island's seismic behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Let's solve this math problem step by step! 1. We have the equation: -37*d + 320 = 61*d + 26 2. First, let's move all the 'd' pieces (terms with 'd') to one side of the equation. To do that, we'll add 37*d to both sides. (-37*d + 37*d) + 320 = 61*d + 26 + 37*d Since -37*d and +37*d are opposites, they cancel out: 0 + 320 = (61*d + 37*d) + 26 So now, our equation looks like this: 320 = 98*d + 26 3. Next, let's separate 'd' by moving the number without a 'd' (26) to the other side. We'll do this by subtracting 26 from both sides: 320 - 26 = 98*d + 26 - 26 294 = 98*d 4. Almost there! Now we just need to find the value of 'd'. To do this, we'll divide both sides by 98: (294 ÷ 98) = (98*d ÷ 98) 3 = d And there you have it!

Plot title: Zorro, The Gay Blade Movie plot: Set in an indeterminate year of the 1840s, the film opens in a villa in Madrid, Spain, where Don Diego de la Vega (George Hamilton), the archetypal Spanish Don Juan, is in bed with a beautiful woman who, we learn shortly, is not his wife, but someone else's. The couple are caught by her husband, Garcia, who \\"is not in Barcelona\\", as they had previously thought. Diego, with considerable panache, fights Garcia and his five brothers with swords. During the fight, Diego's mute servant Paco (Donovan Scott) reads a letter (via gestures) from Diego's father requesting that Diego return to California [then a part of Mexico]. Diego and Paco escape by jumping from a high wall directly into a waiting carriage. Diego and Paco arrive in Los Angeles, where they are met by Diego's childhood friend Esteban (Ron Leibman), who has become capitÃ¡n of the local guard. We also learn that Esteban has married Florinda (Brenda Vaccaro), for whom the men competed when they were boys. Esteban delivers the sad news that Diego's father was killed in a riding accident, when his horse was frightened by a turtle. Esteban is acting alcalde in the senior de la Vega's stead until a new one can be chosen by the dons (landowners) of the area. At the meeting of the dons, each introduces himself and where he resides. Each Don's surname is that of a well-known city in California, but none of the surnames and place-names match, with amusing results:  Don Diego from San Fernando Don Francisco from San Jose Don Fernando from San Diego Don Jose from San Bernardino Don Luis Obispo from Bakersfield, who wears an ascot Esteban is elected alcalde, via an obviously fixed election, and gives his inaugural speech to the assembled peasants in the village plaza. He is interrupted mid-speech by Charlotte Taylor-Wilson (Lauren Hutton), a wealthy political activist from Boston. She and Diego meet, and despite their political differences, there is an immediate attraction. Relaxing at the de la Vega villa, Diego receives an invitation to a masked ball to celebrate... My question: Who does Florinda turn against? A:","output":"Florinda ultimately turns against her husband, Esteban. Throughout the movie, Florinda becomes disillusioned with Esteban's corrupt and oppressive rule as alcalde, and his iron-fisted control over the people of Los Angeles. Diego, the charming and debonair Don Juan, eventually becomes the masked hero, Zorro - fighting against injustice and tyranny, standing up for the oppressed peasants and taking action for the welfare of the citizens. As the story unfolds, Florinda begins to recognize the stark contrast between the character and motives of her husband and those of Zorro (unaware that Diego and Zorro are the same person). She finds herself questioning her allegiance to her husband and starts sympathizing with Zorro's cause. Zorro's acts of heroism, along with his respect and care for the common people, resonates with her, and she begins to find herself drawn to his ideals and fight for justice. As Florinda's loyalty to her husband diminishes, she becomes an advocate for the people who Esteban is oppressing. In the movie's climax, when Zorro's true identity is revealed, Florinda makes her final decision to stand against Esteban's tyranny by supporting Diego and his alter ego, Zorro. In doing so, she embodies the spirit of resilience and desire for justice that Zorro represents, and turns her back on her husband's corrupt and self-serving rule."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - \\"High School Never Ends\\" is a song by the Texas pop punk band Bowling for Soup.

Question: Jerry is crushed by what instrument? Movie plot title: Heavenly Puss Movie plot: Tom is sleeping near the fireplace, but sees Jerry sneaking past him. Jerry goes up onto the dinner table and tries to reach for the food, but Tom whacks him with a knife and Jerry retreats, running up the staircase. Tom pulls the carpet off the staircase to catch Jerry, but also pulls down a large upright piano. While Jerry dodges, the piano squashes Tom to death. Tom's spirit ascends to the \\"Heavenly Express\\", a train that sends dead cats to Heaven. Several cats are waiting to enter, including Butch, who has lost a fight with a bulldog, Frankie, who was struck with a flat iron while singing on a backyard fence, Aloysius, who was run over and flattened by a steamroller, and Fluff, Muff and Puff, the trio of cats who were thrown into a river and drowned as a result of Animal cruelty. The gatekeeper allows them all through as their deaths were untimely, but refuses Tom because he has persecuted \\"an innocent little mouse\\" (Jerry) all of his life. Tom is given a certificate of forgiveness for Jerry to sign to board the train which leaves in one hour. If he fails, Tom will be banished to hell where the devil (Spike) awaits. At first, Tom thinks it was all a dream until he sees the certificate and a clock appears with the gatekeeper warning him to hurry. Tom pleads Jerry to sign, bringing cake, but Jerry eats the cake quick and sprays the pen's ink into Tom's face. Then Tom tries to forge Jerry's signature, but the gatekeeper stops him (\\"Thomas! Ah ah ah-ah-ah!\\"). Then Tom brings a cheese, but Jerry tears the certificate, causing Tom to get angry, grab Jerry and attempt to smash him just because he refuses to help him. The devil pops out and reminds Tom of the consequence of doing so, tempting him to finish the job. Tom explains with him before he ripped the certificate and Jerry signs it, but he misses the deadline and the escalator disappears. He then falls into a hole that directly leads to Hell where he will be tortured by the devil. But then it is revealed that Tom was actually dreaming and he finally wakes...

I had a stress heart attack five years ago. My step-son is a heroin addict. He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I’m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I’m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I’m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband. I honestly think if it had been one of my children doing the abusing, I would have found a way to put my child into long-term rehab. I would not have pretended it wasn’t happening, or “not that bad” or other form of denial.

What is the most interesting thing we learned about the Netherland's World Cup team in their match against Spain? What is the most interesting thing we learned about Spain's World Cup team in their match against the Netherlands? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The questions are not exactly the same, as they inquire about the most interesting thing learned about each respective team - the Netherlands and Spain - during their World Cup match against each other. In response, I will provide an analysis of the most interesting discoveries for each team during that match. Netherlands: The most interesting thing we learned about the Netherlands' World Cup team during their 2014 World Cup match against Spain was their adaptability and the strength of their offensive strategies. This match displayed the Dutch team's ability to dismantle Spain's highly-skilled defense. Netherlands won this match with a remarkable 5-1 victory, showcasing their advanced techniques and tactics. The Dutch team, led by coach Louis van Gaal, implemented a 5-3-2 formation, which allowed them to take advantage of their talented forwards, Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie. Their tactic of utilizing long balls and putting immense pressure on Spain's defense led to numerous scoring opportunities - and eventually, many goals. This match proved that the Dutch team possessed a strong attack; as a matter of fact, the Netherlands had scored the highest number of goals in the 2014 World Cup group stages. Their performance against Spain not only signified their offensive prowess but also exposed the strengths of several key players, such as Daley Blind's pivotal role in creating opportunities for his teammates, Jasper Cillessen's excellent goalkeeping, and the leadership of veteran players like Dirk Kuyt. Overall, this match taught us that the Netherlands' team was a force to be reckoned with. Spain: In contrast, the most interesting thing we learned about Spain's World Cup team during their match against the Netherlands was their vulnerability and the shortcomings in their defensive strategy. They entered the World Cup as the reigning champions, having won the tournament in 2010, and were expected to showcase their prowess once again in Brazil. However, the match against the Netherlands exposed some weaknesses in their usual tactics, particularly their tiki-taka style, which relies on short passing and constant movement to maintain possession and control the game. The Dutch team disrupted this approach by employing an effective high-press strategy and quick counter-attacks. Spain's defense struggled against the pace and skill of players like Robben and Van Persie, who exploited the gaps left by their defenders. The Spanish team appeared lackluster and unprepared against the relentless Dutch attack. This match highlighted that the once-dominant Spanish side, which featured legendary players like Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Xavi, and Andres Iniesta, had become susceptible to stronger, more adaptable opponents. The defeat against the Netherlands was the beginning of Spain's unsuccessful World Cup campaign in 2014, as they were ultimately eliminated in the group stages. In conclusion, while both questions are related, they focus on different aspects and lessons learned from the Netherlands and Spain during their World Cup match against each other. The Netherlands displayed their adaptability, offensive power, and key players' strengths, while Spain's vulnerability and defensive weaknesses were evident during the match."},{"instruction":"Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: In 1953 American Airlines Flight 723 crashed while attempting to land at an airport located in what county?

The desk at the hotel was in better condition than the chair, because the","output":"chair had seen years of wear and tear from countless guests who had occupied the room. The varnish on the wooden desk still held a sheen, a testament to the meticulous maintenance carried out by the diligent hotel staff. It seemed as if the desk had been treated with more respect, its purpose more dignified than that of the chair, which had clearly succumbed to the weight of years of use. The hotel room itself was modest in size, with faded wallpaper that told tales of a bygone era. A single window provided a view of the bustling city outside, allowing sunlight to trickle in just enough to illuminate the room with a soft, warm glow. The carpet, a dull shade of beige, showed signs of staining and frayed edges but was still soft to the touch, offering some semblance of comfort to weary travelers. In contrast, the chair creaked under the weight of even the lightest occupant and seemed almost out of place in the room. Its once vibrant upholstery had long since faded, leaving a mismatched assortment of threads and fabric where once a beautiful pattern had been. The chair's arms were worn smooth by countless hands gripping for support, and the cushion now barely offered any respite to those seeking a brief moment of rest. As if to further emphasize the stark difference between the two, the desk held an assortment of notepads and pens, neatly stacked and awaiting the musings of the guests. A pristine hotel guide, complete with information about the hotel's amenities and nearby attractions, lay by its side, tempting travelers to explore and experience what the area had to offer. It was evident that this desk held some importance to the overall experience of staying at this hotel. The chair, on the other hand, remained resigned to its fate of faded grandeur, only its structure weathered, but still sturdy. It stood silently beside the desk, a relic of what it once was – a royalty that had faded into mere commonality. Yet there was something endearing about the chair's resilience, its unwillingness to give up even after years of suffering. It stood as a testament to the passage of time and the shared experiences of all who had sat in it. As the years went by, the hotel saw renovations and upgrades, rooms receiving fresh coats of paint, new furniture, and modern amenities. Yet, in the corner of this particular room, the old desk and chair lived on – a solemn pair, still occupying the same space. The desk maintained its dignity, and the chair, despite its worn appearance, stood proud alongside it. The contrast between the desk and the chair was a reflection of the various journeys and stories that unfolded within the walls of that hotel room. The desk, always present, always supportive, a stable foundation for the dreams, ideas, and chronicles that would emerge on the notepads and journals that came to rest upon it. The chair, a silent witness to moments of joy and sorrow, providing comfort and solace to weary travelers in need. Together, the desk and chair told the story of the hotel – the intersecting lives of the guests, their endless stories filled with hope, triumph, and loss. Each arrival provided a fresh beginning, while each departure marked another chapter's end. But through it all, the desk and the chair persisted, standing side by side, proud symbols of the timelessness and resilience that resided within the walls of the hotel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which person learned more about isostasy?  Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology.  Hint: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13  cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Answer:","output":"Barry learned more about isostasy, as he is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. The paragraph describes how older oceanic basins are deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy and how the destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones. This information aligns with Barry's areas of expertise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York, Roosevelt belonged to the Democratic Party. He is widely known for leading the United States through the Great Depression and World War II. Before becoming the president, he had already established an active political career. Roosevelt served as a New York State Senator, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and Governor of New York. He was elected president for the first time in 1932 and was re-elected for three consecutive terms, making him the only US president to serve more than two terms. In response to the Great Depression, Roosevelt introduced a series of programs, public work projects, financial reforms, and regulations called the New Deal. The New Deal aimed to provide relief, recovery, and reform to the American people and the economy. Some of the most notable programs included Social Security, the Civilian Conservation Corps, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. During his presidency, Roosevelt also focused on foreign affairs. As mentioned in the initial response, he established a strong friendship with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of the United Kingdom. This bond greatly improved relations between the two countries and laid the foundation for their alliance during World War II. In 1939, as World War II started in Europe, Roosevelt sought to provide aid to the Allies, including Britain, while maintaining the United States' neutrality. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States was officially drawn into the war, with Roosevelt taking on the role of Commander-in-Chief. Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency is remembered for its important domestic and international decisions that shaped the course of American and world history.

As she digs deeper into her research, she starts hearing a mysterious voice that seems to be guiding her study. Initially, she dismisses it as stress-induced hallucinations but soon realizes that the voice reveals insights that are far beyond the realm of her academic knowledge. Caught between her growing obsession and her deteriorating personal life, Cassie follows the eerie whispers in hopes of uncovering a groundbreaking psychological discovery, all while unraveling the dark truths surrounding the voice's origins. Act 1: Cassie is introduced as a dedicated and ambitious postgraduate student diligently working on her thesis in human psychology. Balancing her academic workload with her responsibilities towards her family and friends, Cassie starts becoming overwhelmed and sleep-deprived. Act 2: The first voice appears during one of her late-night study sessions, giving her insights into her subject matter. At first, she brushes it off as a figment of her imagination, brought on by her stress and lack of sleep. However, the voice persists and, given the accuracy and depth of the information provided, Cassie becomes fascinated yet skeptical. As she continues to follow the whispers, her research takes a drastic turn towards unconventional psychological theories. Act 3: Cassie's personal life begins to crumble under the weight of her obsession with the voice, and her relationships suffer as a result. Her friends and family express concern, but she can't shake the feeling that she's on the verge of a significant scientific breakthrough. As she delves deeper into the mysterious voice's origins, she uncovers its sinister past, leading her to question the true intent of the voice and the connection it has with her life. Act 4: As pieces of the puzzle come together, Cassie learns that the voice is linked to a decades-old unsolved mystery involving a missing renowned psychologist, whose unprecedented ideas were shrouded in controversy. The voice is revealed to be the restless spirit of this psychologist attempting to communicate and complete their unfinished work through Cassie. Realizing the risk she faces and the harm she's causing to the people around her, Cassie wrestles with her ambition and the need to solve the mystery at the expense of her own sanity. Act 5: In a thrilling showdown between her morals and her ambition, Cassie decides to confront the voice, demanding that the spirit releases her from its grasp. The voice and Cassie engage in a battle of wills, ultimately culminating in Cassie breaking free from the spirit's control by finding a way to bring closure to the psychologist's past. In the end, Cassie incorporates her harrowing experience into her thesis and gains a greater understanding of the human psyche. She successfully completes her studies, learning important lessons about ambition, loss, and the cost of seeking the truth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The United Nations definition of \\"North Africa\\" includes seven countries and territories; Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya are often collectively referred to as the Maghreb, which is the Arabic word for \\"sunset\\". Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt.  - Byrsa was the walled citadel above the harbour in ancient Carthage . It was also the name of the hill it rested on . The name is derived from the Phoenician word for citadel . In Virgil 's account of Dido 's founding of Carthage , when Dido and her party were encamped at Byrsa , the local Berber chieftain offered them as much land as could be covered with a single oxhide . Therefore , Dido cut an oxhide into tiny strips and set them on the ground end to end until she had completely encircled Byrsa . This story is considered apocryphal , and was most likely invented because Byrsa sounds similar to the Greek word  , meaning oxhide . The citadel dominated the city below and formed the principal military installation of Carthage . It was besieged by Scipio Aemilianus Africanus in the Third Punic War and was defeated and destroyed in 146 BC. Saint Louis Cathedral was built on Byrsa Hill starting in 1884 . Today , it serves as a cultural center . Today , the Byrsa , is part of the archaeological site of Carthage and in addition to the cathedral monument , has the Carthage National Museum built on it .  - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a separate body of water.  - Carthage (from ; Phoenician \\"\\" \\"New City\\") was the centre or capital city of the ancient Carthaginian civilization, on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis in what is now the Tunis Governorate in Tunisia.  - Carthage (' \\"new city\\") was the Phoenician city-state of Carthage and during the 7th to 3rd centuries BC, included its sphere of influence, the Carthaginian Empire. The empire extended over much of the coast of North Africa as well as encompassing substantial parts of coastal Iberia and the islands of the western Mediterranean Sea.  - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'country' with 'tunisia'.

Sentence 2: Ashoka had no interest in a mass conversion. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Possible answers: (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","output":"(c). no; Based on the information given in Sentence 1, we understand that Ashoka played an active role in overseeing a mass conversion, leveraging the concept of dharma and appointing Officers of Righteousness to ensure its enforcement. This indicates that he had a keen interest in aiding and controlling this mass conversion.  Thus, sentence 2, which suggests that Ashoka had no interest in a mass conversion, contradicts the information provided in Sentence 1. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot also be true at the same time, because Ashoka can't simultaneously be interested in overseeing a conversion and uninterested in the conversion. The assertion that Ashoka had no interest in mass conversion would be false if it's true that Ashoka indeed oversaw this mass conversion.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Scientists in Colombia have trained a team of rats to help remove land mines from the countryside. Land mines are small bombs hidden in the ground and designed to explode  when someone steps on them. When trained, the rats can smell special metals in the mines and then signal  to their human team. Then why use rats for such an important job? In the past, dogs have been used to find bombs. Rats have a good sense of smell and can respond to orders, just like dogs do. But rats are much lighter than dogs. They stand less of a chance of setting off the mines, which explode under a certain amount of weight. What's more, the best rats are cheaper to keep than dogs. It costs about the same amount of money to take care of one dog as it does 70 rats. The rats have already been used in Tanzania, an African country with many land mines. Luisa Fernanda Mendez and her team in Colombia are training the even lighter Wistar rats. These are the white rats with red eyes that scientists often use in laboratory experiments. \\" _ even train their babies to perform their jobs, which saves us a lot of time, \\" Mendez said. Colombia has the second-highest rate  of deaths from land mine accidents in the world. Last year, land mines killed 695 people -- 56 of whom were children. A criminal group called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as well as other organizations, have placed the mines. FARC are strongly against Colombia's government. The group has placed mines all around its own bases and in many places in the countryside. In the past, the Colombian government hired peasants and poor farmers to find mines. Many of them died trying to find the well-hidden bombs. Colombian police official Erick Guzman hopes the team of rats can come to the rescue . \\"These rats will be a great help,\\" he said. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Answer: Pick your answer from: (I) Specially-trained rats help clear land mines.. (II) People in Tanzania are suffering from land mines..

Movie title: Dragonheart Movie plot: An English knight, Bowen (Dennis Quaid), mentors a Saxon prince, Einon (Lee Oakes), in the Old Code, the ideals of chivalry in the hope that he will become a better king than his tyrannical father Freyne (Peter Hric). When the king is killed while suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon is mortally wounded by the peasant girl Kara (Sandra Kovacikova). Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life. The dragon replaces Einon's wounded heart with half of its own on the promise that Einon will rule with justice and virtue. However, Einon soon becomes more tyrannical than his father, enslaving the former rebels and forcing them to rebuild a Roman castle. Bowen believes that the dragon's heart has twisted Einon, and swears vengeance on all dragons. Twelve years later, an adult Einon (David Thewlis) has his castle rebuilt. Kara (Dina Meyer) asks the king for pardoning her father after years of slavery, but Einon instead kills him in order to \\"free\\" him. As for Bowen, he has become a very skilled dragonslayer. Brother Gilbert (Pete Postlethwaite), a monk and aspiring poet, observes Bowen slaying a dragon and follows him to record his exploits. Bowen stalks another dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) to its cave, however the confrontation ends in a stalemate. The dragon states that he is the last of his kind, and thus if Bowen kills him, he will be out of a job. The two form a partnership to defraud local villagers with staged dragonslayings. Bowen calls the dragon Draco, after the constellation. Unknown to Bowen, Draco is the dragon who shared his heart with Einon, and through this connection, any pain inflicted upon one is also felt by the other. Meanwhile, Kara, seeking revenge on Einon for murdering her father, is imprisoned after a failed assassination attempt.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: A synthesizer (often abbreviated as synth, also spelled synthesiser) is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate traditional musical instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate novel electronic timbres. They are often played with a musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called sound modules, and are controlled via USB, MIDI or CV/gate using a controller device, often a MIDI keyboard or other controller. Context: In the 1970s, electronic music composers such as Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis and Isao Tomita, released successful synthesizer-led instrumental albums. Over time, this helped influence the emergence of synthpop, a subgenre of new wave, from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The work of German krautrock bands such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream, British acts such as John Foxx, Gary Numan and David Bowie, African-American acts such as George Clinton and Zapp, and Japanese electronic acts such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Kitaro, were influential in the development of the genre. Gary Numan's 1979 hits \\"Are 'Friends' Electric?\\" and \\"Cars\\" made heavy use of synthesizers. OMD's \\"Enola Gay\\" (1980) used distinctive electronic percussion and a synthesized melody. Soft Cell used a synthesized melody on their 1981 hit \\"Tainted Love\\". Nick Rhodes, keyboardist of Duran Duran, used various synthesizers including the Roland Jupiter-4 and Jupiter-8.  Chart hits include Depeche Mode's \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" (1981), The Human League's \\"Don't You Want Me\\" and Giorgio Moroder's Take My Breath Away (1986) for Berlin. Other notable synthpop groups included New Order, Visage, Japan, Men Without Hats, Ultravox, Spandau Ballet, Culture Club, Eurythmics, Yazoo, Thompson Twins, A Flock of Seagulls, Heaven 17, Erasure, Soft Cell, Pet Shop Boys, Bronski Beat, Kajagoogoo, ABC, Naked Eyes, Devo, and the early work of Tears for Fears and Talk Talk. Giorgio Moroder, Brian Eno, Phil Collins, Howard Jones, Stevie Wonder, Peter Gabriel, Thomas Dolby, Kate Bush, Enya, Mike Oldfield, Donal Lunny, Frank Zappa and Todd Rundgren all made use of synthesizers.  The synthesizer became one of the most important instruments in the music industry. Question: What styles of music is it used for?. Whats the answer?","output":"Synthesizers have played a crucial role in shaping modern music by providing musicians with a wide range of sound possibilities and compositional options. They have been used in various styles of music, including but not limited to: 1. Electronic music: Synthesizers are the backbone of electronic music. From the early days of experimental electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s, through the development of genres like Krautrock, ambient, and Berlin School in the 1970s, to more recent subgenres such as techno, house, trance, and EDM, electronic music has relied heavily on synthesizers for generating distinctive sounds and textures. 2. Synthpop and New Wave: As mentioned in the context, synthpop emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a subgenre of new wave. It is characterized by the use of synthesizers as the primary instrument, often replacing traditional rock instruments such as guitars and drums. Notable synthpop acts include Depeche Mode, The Human League, Soft Cell, and Gary Numan. New Wave also employed synthesizers, as heard in the music of bands like Talking Heads, Blondie, and Duran Duran. 3. Progressive Rock: Synthesizers are frequently employed in progressive rock, a genre known for its complex compositions and the integration of rock music with classical and experimental elements. Bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and Genesis utilized synthesizers to create lush, expansive soundscapes and intricate arrangements. 4. Pop music: Synthesizers have been incorporated in many mainstream pop songs since the 1980s. Artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, and more recently, Lady Gaga, have used synthesizers to craft catchy hooks and create unique sonic textures. 5. Film scores and soundtracks: Synthesizers have been utilized in the creation of film scores and soundtracks, contributing to the atmosphere and mood of movies. Composers such as Vangelis (Blade Runner, Chariots of Fire), John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York), and Hans Zimmer (Inception, Interstellar) have made extensive use of synthesizers in their film scores. 6. Hip-hop and R&B: Synthesizers are used in hip-hop and R&B music for creating various melodic and percussive elements. Dr. Dre, Timbaland, and Kanye West are notable producers who have incorporated synthesizer sounds in their compositions. 7. Rock music: While not as prominent as in other genres, synthesizers have been used by rock bands to add depth and versatility to their sound. Bands like U2, Radiohead, and Muse have successfully integrated synthesizers into their music. 8. Experimental and avant-garde: Synthesizers have played a significant role in the development of experimental and avant-garde music, as they allow artists to explore new sonic territories and create innovative soundscapes. Composers like Brian Eno, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Laurie Anderson have all embraced the synthesizer as a tool for pushing musical boundaries. In conclusion, the versatility and flexibility of synthesizers have made them an essential instrument across various music genres. From pop to experimental, synthesizers have helped shape the sound and identity of several musical styles and remain a vital component of modern music production."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.  Paragraph: Ants are one of the most interesting creatures on earth. David wants to study ants for his biology project. He is specifically interested in ant species Acromyrmex heyeri.

Here, the given equation is a linear equation with variable k. Let's go step by step: 1. The given equation is 55*k + 55 = 44*k 2. We need to isolate k by moving all k terms to one side of the equation and constants to the other side. To achieve this, we can subtract 44*k from both sides of the equation: 55*k - 44*k + 55 = 44*k - 44*k 3. Now simplify the equation by combining the k terms on the left side: (55 - 44)*k + 55 = 0 11*k + 55 = 0 4. Next, move the constant term to the other side by subtracting 55 from both sides of the equation: 11*k + 55 - 55 = 0 - 55 11*k = - 55 5. Finally, to find the value of k, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11: 11*k / 11 = -55 / 11 k = -5 So, the solution for the equation 55*k + 55 = 44*k is k = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bruno Bartoletti, Maestro Who Shaped Lyric Opera of Chicago, Dies at 86 His death was announced by Lyric and by Teatro Comunale in Florence, with which he was also associated for many years. Mr. Bartolettiâs work with Lyric spanned most of its history, an affiliation bracketed by operas of Verdi. He was 30 when he made his American debut there, conducting âIl Trovatoreâ in 1956, two years after the companyâs founding; he made his final appearance there in 2007 with âLa Traviata.â In between he led the Lyric orchestra in nearly 600 performances of more than 50 different operas. He was named co-artistic director of the company, along with Pino Donati, in 1964, and sole artistic director in 1975, a post he held until 1999. Acknowledged as a superb interpreter of the 19th- and early-20th-century music of his great countrymen, Mr. Bartoletti had a wide repertory at the Lyric â sometimes called âLa Scala Westâ â embracing other musical traditions and modern music, from Slavic works like Smetanaâs âBartered Brideâ and Mussorgskyâs âBoris Godunovâ to Alban Bergâs severe, atonal âWozzeck.â In 1978, Mr. Bartoletti conducted the world premiere of Krzysztof Pendereckiâs âParadise Lost.â In 1964, in Florence, he conducted the Italian premiere of the rarely performed early Shostakovich opera âThe Nose,â which was adapted from a subversive story by Gogol and which had been suppressed in the Soviet Union. Matthew A. Epstein, who succeeded Mr. Bartoletti as Lyricâs artistic director, said in an interview on Wednesday that it was Mr. Bartolettiâs passion for modern music that led the company to include American and 20th-century European works each season. It was Mr. Bartoletti, Mr. Epstein said, who suggested that the company forge a partnership with the American composer William Bolcom. He wrote three commissioned operas that had their premieres at Lyric from 1992 to 2004: âMcTeague,â based on the novel by Frank Norris; âA View From the Bridge,â an adaptation of the Arthur Miller play; and âA Wedding,â based on the film by Robert Altman, who directed the opera as well. âThough the gods of Verdi and Puccini and Donizetti were high in his personal pantheon, what made Bruno different from a lot of Italian conductors of his day was that this was a man who was fascinated by the music of his own time,â Mr. Epstein said. Mr. Bartoletti brought the young Italian conductors Daniele Gatti and Riccardo Chailly to Lyric for their American debuts, and he encouraged young American talent as well: Leonard Slatkin, Dennis Russell Davies and George Manahan conducted at Lyric, and a 25-year-old Peter Sellars directed âThe Mikadoâ there in 1983. âBruno pushed Lyric forward at a time when it could have been stagnating, settling into the traditional repertory,â William Mason, Lyricâs general director emeritus, said on Wednesday. âHe brought in new stage directors, more theatrical productions than we had been used to. As a conductor, baton technique was not his strong point, but there was an innate musicality and sensitivity in him, an understanding of singers and what they needed.â Among the singers with whom he worked at Lyric were the sopranos Catherine Malfitano and Renata Tebaldi; the mezzo-sopranos Grace Bumbry and Marilyn Horne, and the tenors PlÃ¡cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Richard Tucker. Mr. Bartoletti was born on June 10, 1926, in Sesto Fiorentino, near Florence. His father, Umberto, was a blacksmith who played clarinet in a local band and inspired Brunoâs interest in music. He played the piccolo as a boy, and his talent was recognized by a teacher whose husband, the sculptor Antonio Berti, recommended him to the Florence Conservatory. There he studied flute and piano and became a pianist at a center for opera training. He assisted a number of leading conductors, including Dimitri Mitropoulos, Vittorio Gui and Tullio Serafin. A longtime friend, Luigi Serra, said in an interview that during World War II, Mr. Bartoletti entertained American troops in Florence by playing the piano, and that he spoke warmly of his first contacts with Americans, the music of Cole Porter and of America in general. âPeople would say he brought so much to Chicago, but he would say it didnât matter, Chicago gave him more,â Mr. Serra said. âHe always said Chicago gave him everything.â Mr. Bartoletti made his conducting debut at Teatro Comunale with âRigolettoâ in 1953. He made his Lyric debut in 1956 as a replacement. When Mr. Serafin, who had been scheduled to conduct âIl Trovatoreâ there, became ill, the baritone Tito Gobbi recommended Mr. Bartoletti to one of the Lyricâs founders, Carol Fox. Mr. Bartoletti, who rarely strayed from the opera podium to conduct symphonic works, was not known to be especially peripatetic. But he nonetheless conducted at the Rome Opera, Covent Garden in London, La Scala in Milan, Genevaâs Grand ThÃ©Ã¢tre and Teatro ColÃ³n in Buenos Aires. He spent summers at his home in Florence. His wife, Rosanna, whom he had known since childhood, died in 2011. He is survived by two daughters, Chiara and Maria, and five grandchildren. âOne more thing to say about him,â Mr. Epstein said. âHe had a wonderful marriage, wonderful children, a beautiful home. He was a happy man.â Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Bruno Bartoletti, a maestro who guided the Lyric Opera of Chicago for more than 50 years, passed away at the age of 86.

Question: Why would holding a baby after you circumsised it help you ?","output":"Holding a baby after circumcision helps both the baby and the individual performing the circumcision for various reasons. It can be an emotionally and physically comforting experience for both parties involved, and it promotes bonding, trust, and healing.  1. Emotional Support: Circumcision is a surgical procedure that can be emotionally taxing not just for the baby but also for the individual performing it. Holding the baby afterward can provide the emotional reassurance that the procedure is complete and the child is safe and well-taken care of. This emotional exchange can be soothing to both the baby and the person performing the circumcision. 2. Physical Comfort: Physical touch, especially skin-to-skin contact, is essential for newborns' development and overall well-being. Holding the baby after circumcision can help provide warmth, comfort, and security to the child. Skin-to-skin contact stimulates the release of oxytocin, known as the \\"love hormone,\\" in both the baby and the person holding them, which reinforces bonding and helps calm and soothe the baby. 3. Pain Relief: Touch and holding the baby can also help reduce the perception of pain in the baby after the circumcision. The soothing touch and cuddling can provide a sense of security that helps the baby feel less distressed. The sensations from being held can distract the baby from the pain, offering relief and making it easier for them to focus on their surroundings. 4. Trust and Bonding: Holding the baby after a circumcision helps establish trust between the baby and the person performing the procedure. This trust can be critical for the baby's future interactions with healthcare providers and can also strengthen the bond between the baby and the person who performed the circumcision. This nurturing touch helps the baby understand that he is in a safe and caring environment. 5. Reduced Stress: The act of holding the baby releases hormones in the person performing the circumcision that can help relieve stress and anxiety associated with the procedure. By providing support to the baby and feeling his comfort, the person holding the baby can also experience a sense of comfort and relief in knowing that the baby is doing well after the procedure. In conclusion, holding a baby after circumcision is not only beneficial for the baby but also for the person performing the procedure. It provides emotional support, physical comfort, pain relief, trust and bonding, and reduced stress. It is an essential component of ensuring a positive and nurturing experience for both baby and caregiver during what can be a challenging time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere - The Earth's temperature rises -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose plants begin to die happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If plants begin to die off, it will indeed have a direct and indirect effect on the process of the greenhouse effect, potentially leading to a smaller greenhouse effect. Let's explore these effects in detail. 1. Direct Effects on Carbon Sequestration: Plants play a critical role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. They convert this CO2 into organic compounds like glucose, which are then stored in their biomass (stems, leaves, roots, etc.). This process is known as carbon sequestration, and it helps to reduce the amount of CO2 present in the atmosphere. If plants begin to die, this carbon sequestration process would be disrupted, potentially leading to an increase in the level of atmospheric CO2. However, it's important to note that the effect on the greenhouse effect will depend on the scale of the plant die-off and the balance between the amounts of CO2 being released through natural processes like respiration and decomposition, and CO2 being absorbed by the surviving plants. 2. Indirect Effects on Climate Feedbacks: Plants also have indirect impacts on the climate system, which can influence the greenhouse effect. For example, plants can help regulate local and regional climates by releasing moisture through the process of transpiration. This process can affect local air temperatures, humidity levels, and cloud formation, which, in turn, can influence the overall energy balance and temperature of the Earth. If plants begin to die off, this could disrupt these local climate feedback processes, potentially leading to a smaller greenhouse effect in some areas. However, the effect of plant death on climate feedbacks is complex and depends on many factors, including the species of plants affected, their distribution, and their role in the local ecosystem. 3. Indirect Effects on Albedo: Another indirect effect of plant death on the greenhouse effect involves albedo, or the measure of the reflectivity of Earth's surface. Vegetation typically has a lower albedo compared to surfaces like snow, ice or bare ground. This means that areas covered in vegetation tend to absorb more solar radiation, which can help warm the Earth. If plants die off and the land becomes less vegetated, the albedo of the affected areas may increase, leading to a higher reflection of solar radiation back into space. This increased reflection could partially offset the greenhouse effect by reducing the amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth, thereby leading to a smaller greenhouse effect. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of plants dying off will indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the greenhouse effect that could potentially lead to a smaller greenhouse effect. However, the exact magnitude and direction of the change in the greenhouse effect will depend on several factors, including the scale of plant die off, the types of plants affected, and the balance between the different processes involved in the climate system.

When the US entered World War I in April 1917, the Navy had an immediate requirement to expand the Great Lakes Station in order to house, process, and train 20,000 naval recruits, this number would rise to 50,000 by the end of the year. Lieutenant Malachi Elliott, a graduate of the US Naval Academy, was appointed Public Works Officer at Great Lakes on 18 June 1917, at which time about 500 enlisted men had been assigned to the Public Works Department. Seeing that the department would need to expand with skilled craftsmen, architects, draftsmen, designers, and other professional and technical people, he began to screen incoming recruits with these skills. Finding many, but not enough, he expanded to recruiting civilians outside of the installation, getting many men willing to join the Navy as petty officers, with the understanding that qualified men could later apply for commissions. This allowed the Public Works Department to grow to nearly 600 men by July 1917. They were organized into the Twelfth Regiment (Public Works), which was essentially the Public Works Department because staff officers could not exercise military command. Lieutenant William C. Davis was appointed commanding officer of the regiment, he exercised military control, but the Public Works Officers exercised technical control. In October 1917, the regiment began building Camp Paul Jones at San Diego. With its completion, on 30 December 1917, the regiment became \\"fully operational\\" with 1,500 men organized into three battalions. By April 1918, the regiment consisted of 2,400 in five battalions. Men were withdrawn for assignments in the US and abroad. In spring of 1918, 100 men were given special mechanics and ordnance training before being sent to St. Nazaire, France, to assemble 14\\"/50 caliber railway gun. Later they would join the gun crews and perform combat duties along the railway lines in proximity to the Empire of Germany lines. The Twelfth Regiment reached its peak strength 5 November 1918; 55 officers and 6,211 enlisted men formed into 11 battalions. However, with the end of the war on Armistice of 11 November 1918, the regiment gradually faded away by the end of 1918. Answer this question based on the article: How many months after the US entered World War I was Lieutenant Malachi Elliott appointed Public Works Officer at Great Lakes?","output":"Lieutenant Malachi Elliott was appointed Public Works Officer at Great Lakes on 18 June 1917. The United States entered World War I in April 1917. Therefore, it took approximately 2 months after the US entered World War I for Lieutenant Malachi Elliott to be appointed Public Works Officer at Great Lakes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

All dies wird von einer Kultur des In-Frage-Stellens dessen begleitet, was vorher nicht hinterfragt wurde – einschließlich der Art der Unternehmensführung und der ethischen Qualität der Handlungen einer Organisation. Translate to English English:","output":"All of this is accompanied by a culture of questioning what was not previously questioned - including the type of corporate management and the ethical quality of an organization's actions. In today's rapidly changing world, there is a growing awareness of the importance of questioning long-held beliefs and practices. This cultural shift affects various aspects of society, including the way businesses are managed and the ethical considerations behind an organization's actions. This increasing skepticism towards traditional models and the willingness to question even the most fundamental aspects of an organization are essential for progress and innovation. Starting with corporate management, organizations are reevaluating the traditional top-down hierarchical structures that have long dominated the business world. By questioning these models, companies are opening up to more inclusive, collaborative, and democratic approaches. This can lead to greater employee engagement, improved decision-making, and a more agile organizational culture. Some organizations are incorporating elements of self-management and cross-functional teams, looking at how they can empower employees to make critical decisions and foster a sense of shared ownership in the company's success. Ethical considerations have become equally important in the business world. Organizations are now expected to behave responsibly and make decisions that reflect not only their financial interests but also their social and environmental impact. This shift towards a more ethical and socially conscious business landscape has led companies to focus on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability initiatives, recognizing that decisions made today will have lasting effects on future generations. Several factors contribute to this culture of questioning previous beliefs and practices. Increased access to information through technology allows for a more transparent view of a company's operations, pressuring businesses to be more responsible and ethical in their decision-making. The rise of social media has provided a powerful platform for sharing information and holding organizations accountable for their actions. Moreover, the younger generations entering the workforce bring new perspectives and values, further driving the need for companies to reevaluate their leadership structures and ethical practices. Consumers, too, are increasingly concerned with the environmental and social impact of the products they purchase, motivating companies to adopt sustainable practices and prioritize ethical decision-making. To cultivate a culture that embraces questioning previous beliefs and practices, companies should: 1. Foster open communication and collaboration: Encourage the sharing of ideas, knowledge, and perspectives among all levels of an organization, and create an environment where employees feel comfortable challenging the status quo. 2. Redefine leadership roles: Rethink the traditional top-down management model and focus on empowering employees to take on more responsibility and accountability for decision-making. 3. Prioritize ethics and sustainability: Integrate ethical considerations into all aspects of the business, and develop long-term strategies that prioritize the well-being of people, planet, and profit. 4. Create inclusive opportunities for growth and development: Offer learning and development opportunities that enable employees to gain new skills and perspectives, and encourage them to apply this knowledge to drive innovation and change within the organization. 5. Hold leadership accountable for ethical behavior: Establishing a strong foundational code of ethics for the organization will help ensure that leadership is held accountable for their actions and the impact they have on employees, stakeholders, and the wider community. By embracing a culture that questions past practices and supports ongoing innovation, organizations can adapt and thrive amidst the challenges of the 21st century, creating a more sustainable and responsible future for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rakenteellisten uudistusten toimeenpanon, joka on mielestäni Lissabonin sopimuksen poliittisesti vaikein osa, on oltava pääasiallinen poliittinen tavoitteemme. Translate to English English:","output":"The implementation of structural reforms, which I believe is the most politically challenging part of the Lisbon Treaty, must be our primary political objective. The Lisbon Treaty, which came into force on December 1, 2009, aims to enhance the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the European Union (EU) and to strengthen its global role. The treaty consists of numerous amendments that seek to reform the EU's institutional structure, as well as to improve its decision-making processes. However, the success of these reforms is largely dependent on their proper implementation by EU member states, which, as mentioned above, poses significant political challenges. One of the key structural reforms introduced by the Lisbon Treaty is the strengthening of the role of the European Parliament (EP) in the legislative process. This is achieved by extending the co-decision procedure, now known as the ordinary legislative procedure, to a wider range of policy areas. It enables the EP to have an equal say with the Council of the European Union on the adoption of EU legislation. As a result, the democratic legitimacy of the EU decision-making process has been enhanced, given the direct election of EP members by European citizens. Another important structural reform is the new voting system in the Council of the European Union, known as the double majority voting system. This system requires a majority of both the member states and the EU population for a decision to be approved. It was designed to ensure that decisions made within the Council are more representative of the EU's diverse population while also preventing individual member states from blocking decisions that are supported by a majority of other members. Furthermore, the Lisbon Treaty also introduced changes to the European Commission, the EU's executive body. It reduced the number of European Commissioners by making their appointment based on a rotation system among member states. This change aimed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission's work, as well as to encourage cooperation among member states. Despite these structural reforms, there are still numerous political challenges that need to be addressed. One of the most pertinent issues is the EU's democratic deficit, which refers to a perceived disconnect between EU institutions and European citizens. Although the Lisbon Treaty has strengthened the role of the EP, many citizens still feel a lack of influence on EU decision-making. This issue can be addressed by improving communication between EU institutions and citizens, as well as by encouraging greater citizen participation in the political process. Another important challenge is the difficulty of forging consensus among the 27 EU member states on key policy issues. This task is becoming increasingly complex as the EU continues to face various internal and external challenges, such as migration, economic inequality, and climate change. Addressing these challenges and implementing the structural reforms called for by the Lisbon Treaty will require strong political leadership and a commitment to dialogue and cooperation among member states. In conclusion, the implementation of structural reforms as part of the Lisbon Treaty is a crucial step towards achieving a more effective, democratic, and globally influential European Union. While there are undoubtedly political challenges to overcome, with strong leadership and genuine commitment from member states, these reforms have the potential to significantly improve the functioning of the EU and the quality of life for its citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that is attracted to Mark?  Nina, an interpreter, is beside herself with grief at the recent death of her boyfriend, Jamie, a cellist. When she is on the verge of despair, Jamie reappears as a \\"ghost\\" and the couple are reunited. Nina is ecstatic. But Jamie tells her about his days while she is at work, and one dialogue suggests she should embrace the life around her; one of these is about a memorial plaque in a park about a dead child and how parents who read it feel an immediate, compelling need to hug their children. The returned Jamie also reminds her that he also irritated her, and as a ghost he manifests behaviours she'd have little patience for – turning up the central heating to stifling levels, moving furniture around and inviting back \\"ghost friends\\" to watch videos. This infuriates her, and their relationship deteriorates. She meets Mark, a psychologist, to whom she is attracted, but she is unwilling to become involved with him because of Jamie's continued presence. Nina continues to love Jamie but is conflicted by his self-centred behaviour and ultimately wonders out loud, \\"Was it always like this?\\" Over Nina's objections, Jamie decides to leave to allow her to move on. Towards the end of the film, Jamie watches Nina leave and one of his fellow ghosts asks, \\"Well?\\" and Jamie responds, \\"I think so... Yes.\\" At this point the central conceit of the movie has become clear: Jamie came back specifically to help Nina get over him by tarnishing her idealised memory of him.","output":"The first name of the person attracted to Mark is Nina."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Grahame was born Gloria Grahame Hallward in Los Angeles, California. She was raised a Methodist. Her father, Reginald Michael Bloxam Hallward, was an architect and author; her mother, Jeanne McDougall, who used the stage name Jean Grahame, was a British stage actress and acting teacher. The couple had an older daughter, Joy Hallward (1911-2003), an actress who married John Mitchum (the younger brother of actor Robert Mitchum). In March, 1974, Grahame was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent radiation treatment, changed her diet, stopped smoking and drinking alcohol, and also sought homeopathic remedies. In less than a year the cancer went into remission. The cancer returned in 1980 but Grahame refused to acknowledge her diagnosis or seek radiation treatment. Despite her failing health, Grahame continued working in stage productions in the United States and the United Kingdom.  In Autumn of 1981 while performing in Lancaster, England, Grahame was taken ill. The local hospital wanted to perform surgery immediately, which she refused. Contacting her former lover, actor Peter Turner, she requested to live in Liverpool, in the home of his mother. Grahame requested that Turner not contact medical people or her family but Turner did so, as he was concerned about her health. According to Turner's book, Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool, his local family doctor told Grahame she had a cancerous tumor in her abdomen \\"the size of a football\\". Breast cancer is not mentioned in the book. Peter Turner informed two of Grahame's children, Timothy and Paulette, who were in the United States, of her illness. They travelled to Liverpool deciding to take their mother back to the United States against the wishes of the doctor, Grahame, Peter Turner and his family.  After staying six days at the home of Peter Turner's mother, on 5 October 1981 Grahame was flown back to the United States by her two children where she was immediately admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City. She died in the hospital a few hours after admittance at the age of 57. Her remains were interred in Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, Los Angeles.

The rebellion was extended to the Oecussi enclave, but without any coordination with the rebellion elsewhere. During the second phase of his offensive, da Câmara divided his reinforced army into four columns. His own column set out from Maubisse and comprised twenty Europeans, two hundred Africans and five hundred moradores. Including the arraias of allied chieftains, it contained over 4,000 troops. It also had a modern Krupp 75 mm field gun. The second column, comprising an Indian company with a Nordenfelt mitrailleuse and several hundred moradores, marched from Soibada; the third, with two Europeans, seventy Africans and two hundred moradores armed with another Nordenfelt, from Suru; and the fourth, a flying column with one hundred moradores, from the Dutch border.

UPDATED:. 13:22 EST, 11 October 2013. A mother-of-two who advertized a 19,000 diamond ring on Craigslist has been lured hundreds of miles from her home by a man claiming he wanted to buy it before he robbed her, she has told police. Emily Graham, 32, said the man paid for her flight from Madison, Wisconsin to St Louis, Missouri for September 21, claiming he wanted to get the ring appraised and buy it for his wife. When she landed at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, a car service picked her up to take her to a jewelry store to meet the buyer - but instead, he took her to an abandoned warehouse, she said. Scam: Emily Graham, left, said a man flew her to St Louis after responding to her Craigslist ad for a 19,000 diamond ring - before he allegedly stole it. Police have released an image of a 'person of interest', right. 'The neighborhood was really shady,' she told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. 'He pulled into the back of an abandoned warehouse and stopped the car, and someone was pounding on my window, saying, \\"Stop the car\\".' The man then demanded the ring, she said: 'It felt like an eternity, maybe 30 seconds, and I realized I've been scammed.' The driver pretended to act shocked and put his hands in the air but sat in the car while the suspect robbed her of the ring, her purse, her laptop, an iPhone, other jewelry and her shoes, she said. 'He could have killed me or raped me behind that warehouse,' she said. He hit her across the head with a pistol and forced her behind the building before leaving in the vehicle, an SUV, she said. She then ran to a nearby house for help and called police. Stolen: She said she wanted to sell the ring, pictured, to raise money as she went through a divorce. Berkeley Police Maj. Art Jackson told the Post-Dispatch that they are now checking nearby pawn shops for the items. He said the buyer had used a fake name in the correspondence and that the plane ticket had been bought with a stolen credit card. He said there was no doubt that the incident had occurred. 'We believe her,' Jackson said. 'She was in a very frantic state. Once the investigators started talking with her, they believed it did actually occur.' Victim: Graham, pictured wearing the ring, said she was taken to an abandoned building and robbed before the suspect drove off and left her there. She went to a home for help and called police. Graham, who works in website marketing, did not have the ring insured and after the robbery, she launched an online fundraising campaign to raise 30,000 to fund an after-school care program - which police said had raised some suspicions but that they weren't going to discount her story. She added that she needed the money from the ring, which she and her former husband bought and had appraised for 36,000 in 2007, because she was going through a divorce.

Input: Question: What is the release of particles and/or energy from the nucleus of an atom described as? Answer: radioactivity Output:","output":"Supporting Fact 1: Radioactivity involves the spontaneous decay of unstable atomic nuclei, which results in the release of energy and/or particles, such as alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. Supporting Fact 2: The three primary types of radioactive decay that lead to the release of particles and energy are alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay. Each of these decay processes involves a specific type of particle or energy emitted from the nucleus of an atom. Supporting Fact 3: The discovery of radioactivity by Antoine Henri Becquerel in 1896 marked a significant turning point in our understanding of atomic structure and the forces within the nucleus. Supporting Fact 4: Radioactive decay is a random process governed by nuclear forces, in which unstable isotopes transform into more stable ones over time. This process can be described statistically by using the concept of half-life. Supporting Fact 5: Due to its ability to ionize atoms and molecules, radioactivity has various practical applications, such as in medical imaging and cancer treatment, as well as risks associated with exposure to ionizing radiation, which can lead to tissue damage and increased cancer risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase?, what is it ?

Martin Robinson. PUBLISHED:. 10:04 EST, 11 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:29 EST, 11 January 2013. Missed: Jimmy Savile could have been prosecuted in 2009 but police and prosecutors were too cautious, a report has found. A chance to convict Jimmy Savile for sex offences when he was alive was missed because police and prosecutors did not take victims seriously enough, an official report said today. Details of a review of the decision not to prosecute Savile in 2009 by. Alison Levitt QC, legal adviser to the director of public prosecutions, were disclosed today. Her report was released in tandem with an official police probe into the DJ's 60 years of abuse that revealed that he raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450, including children as young as eight. Since the paedophile DJ died in October 2011 aged 84, a staggering 214 official crimes have been recorded by 28 police forces. In her review Ms Levitt found one alleged victim was told by Sussex police officers that Savile's lawyers would make 'mincemeat' of her in a 'big London court' if she pursued her sex assault claim. In 1970, the Savile fan club member had been groped and forced to touch the DJ's genitals after he invited her into his camper van after she went to watch Top Of The Pops at BBC Television Centre. After going to the police in 2008, the woman, known as Ms A, was told by investigating officers that 'she would be publicly branded a liar and that her name would be all over the newspapers, particularly if she lost the case', the report says. Deputy Chief Constable Giles York from Sussex Police said today: 'We recognise that we could have done better and are committed to honest reflection and learning lessons for the future.' A statement from Sussex Police went on: 'We understand the conclusion the DPP has drawn, that our officers may have inadvertently dissuaded the victim from supporting any prosecution. It can be difficult in such circumstances to achieve the balance between supporting and reassuring a victim, whilst providing honest advice about the prosecution process and standard of evidence needed.' This 'dissuaded her from pursuing her allegation', she concluded. Three offences were also being investigated in 2008 by Surrey Police but they were not continued either. Ms Levitt said that there was nothing to suggest the victims had colluded in their stories, or that they were unreliable, yet police and prosecutors treated their claims 'with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required', she said. Attack: One victim was told by police that if she pursued her claim Savile's lawyers would make 'mincemeat' of her in court. Surrey Police received an allegation in May 2007 that Savile had sexually assaulted a teenage girl at Duncroft Children's Home in the late 1970s. In the investigation that followed, two more allegations emerged - the first that in about 1973 Jimmy Savile had sexually assaulted a girl aged about 14 outside Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The second was that in the 1970s Jimmy Savile had suggested to a girl aged about 17, again at Duncroft, that she perform oral sex on him. Pledge: Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said today the way sexual abuse is investigated will be changed. In March 2008, Sussex Police received a complaint that Savile had sexually assaulted a woman in her early twenties in a caravan in Sussex in about 1970. Surrey Police consulted with the CPS about all four allegations, and in October 2009 it was decided that no prosecution could be brought because the alleged victims would not support police action. Ms Levitt found that Surrey Police did not tell each alleged victim that other complaints had been made, Sussex told the complainant that corroboration was needed and the prosecutor did not question why victims would not support court action or seek to build a case. The victims told Ms Levitt that if they had known that other people were making complaints, they probably would have been prepared to give evidence in court. Meanwhile her review showed how Savile had simply said that the accusations were just 'invented' and an 'occupational hazard' for anyone famous like him. He also said he had a 'policy' to sue anyone who printed these accusations, having taken legal action against five papers previously. 'If this does not disappear then my policy will swing into action', he told Surrey officers, the report says. Surrey Police assistant chief constable Jerry Kirkby said: 'It is important the actions taken by the investigation team are viewed in context. This should take into account what information was known about Jimmy Savile in 2007 and the necessary consideration given by police to the impact of their actions on securing successful court action against him. 'At the time, there was nothing to suggest the level of offending now being reported on a national scale. In July 2007, Surrey Police used national systems to conduct intelligence checks with every other police force in England and Wales. These checks found no record of any police intelligence or prior allegations relating to Jimmy Savile.' DPP Keir Starmer said he wanted the case to be 'a watershed moment'. 'In my view, these cases do not simply reflect errors of judgment by individual officers or prosecutors on the facts before them,' he said. 'If that were the case, they would, in many respects, be easier to deal with. These were errors of judgment by experienced and committed police officers and a prosecuting lawyer acting in good faith and attempting to apply the correct principles. That makes the findings of Ms Levitt's report more profound and calls for a more robust response.' 'Hazard': Savile, who was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in his camper van, had told police that the allegations aimed at him was just because he was famous and were malicious. He drew parallels with a damning report on the investigation of a grooming gang in Rochdale. Mr Starmer said police and prosecutors have approached sex offence allegations 'with a degree of caution which is not generally justified'. He said guidance will be drawn up on prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases to underline that 'the credibility of the complainant's account has to be seen in its proper context'. An agreement has been drawn up with the Association of Chief Police Officers that:. Mr Starmer also said that information on cases where a complaint has been made but a prosecution cannot be brought will be shared more fully with police and other relevant agencies.

Instead, it essentially condones his late behavior by adjusting everything else to suit him. III.

Emily is less likely to go on a cruise. Step-by-step justification: 1. The sentence states that Kayla gets seasick less often than Emily. 2. Getting seasick is a negative experience for someone who is on a cruise. 3. If Kayla experiences seasickness less frequently than Emily, it would mean Emily would have a higher likelihood of suffering from seasickness while on a cruise. 4. People generally try to avoid negative experiences, so Emily, who suffers from seasickness more often, is less likely to choose to go on a cruise.

Protesters in parts of Egypt rallied Friday against the government and a vote on a constitution that would ban religious parties, leading to clashes with security forces or demonstrators' opponents in at least three cities, Egyptian media reported. The demonstrations are the latest by members or supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that has regularly protested Egypt's interim government since Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Morsy was ousted in a coup in July. Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with opponents in parts of Cairo after Morsy loyalists tore down posters supporting the proposed constitution, on which Egyptians will vote Tuesday and Wednesday, the semiofficial Ahram Online news outlet reported. In Giza, security forces fired tear gas at Morsy supporters to disperse their march there, Ahram Online reported. The demonstrators began to march after Friday prayers and clashed with police in various parts of the city, Ahram Online said. Clashes also broke out in al-Sabah city in Suez province, where security forces fired tear gas at a pro-Morsy march, according to the state-run Middle East News Agency. The Muslim Brotherhood-led National Alliance to Support Legitimacy had called for protests, MENA said. The alliance has focused its ire on Egypt's January 14-15 referendum on a new constitution, which would not only ban religious parties but also put more power in the hands of the military. The alliance has called for a boycott of the referendum. Muslim Brotherhood supporters have continued their protests, even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization. Supporters of the organization demand the reinstatement of Morsy, who became the country's first democratically elected president in 2012, and the full restoration of their political and social rights. The interim government blames the group for coordinated attacks on churches and government facilities, including a recent bombing of a police headquarters that left 16 dead and more than 100 injured. The military ousted Morsy on July 3 after he was accused of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy's supporters say that the deposed president wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. Morsy is awaiting trial in several cases, including one in which he and 14 other Muslim Brotherhood members face charges stemming from December 2012 protests over a constitution he shepherded into effect. Egyptian authorities have accused Morsy and his staff of ordering supporters to attack protesters after guards and members of the Interior Ministry refused to do it. Morsy and four others are charged with inciting violence, but they are not accused of using force. Eleven others are charged with killing three men, torturing 54 people, using force and possessing weapons. That trial, delayed Wednesday, is expected to resume on February 1. Morsy, who says he still is Egypt's legitimate president, has refused to recognize the court's authority and has yet to accept legal representation for the proceeding. CNN's Jason Hanna, Sarah Sirgany, Saad Abedine and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In Egypt, people called protesters were not happy with the government and some decisions being made. They were supporting a group called the Muslim Brotherhood and a leader named Mohamed Morsy who used to be in charge of the country. The government and some other people didn't agree with them, and sometimes they had arguments or fights in different cities. The Muslim Brotherhood's supporters want their leader, Morsy, to be in charge again because they think he was treated unfairly. The government doesn't like the Muslim Brotherhood and thinks they do some bad things, so they said the group is not allowed anymore and that people who support them could get in trouble. Morsy has to go to court because some people say he did some bad things, but he doesn't think it's fair and doesn't want to go."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body.  Question: suppose earth doesn't have a volcano happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"A: The situation you propose involves two unrelated processes – the cooling of the human body through sweat evaporation and volcanic activity on Earth. In the case of sweat evaporation, the body cools itself by releasing sweat, which then evaporates, taking heat away from the body and cooling the skin. This mechanism remains the same regardless of the presence or absence of volcanic activity on Earth. Now, considering the theoretical scenario where Earth does not experience any volcanic activity, this would not have a direct impact on the body's cooling process through sweat evaporation. There might be some indirect effects on climate and weather, but they would not significantly change the body's primary cooling mechanism. Taking the information into account, the answer to your question is that no volcanic activity on Earth would have no significant effect on the body's cooling process through sweat evaporation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nick Kyrgios and Andy Murray: the bromance capable of saving a career It was a three-word tweet which spoke volumes. No sooner had Andy Murray completed his remarkable ascension to the top of men’s tennis, Nick Kyrgios paid homage on social media. “U the man” wrote the Australian before posting a picture of him rubbing Murray’s head. A heartwarming tennis “bromance” for the ages. Though as the 21-year-old licks his wounds following a meltdown in Shanghai last month which earned severe ATP sanctions and sessions with a sports psychologist, watching his buddy reach for the stars can only have a positive effect. There is, after all, much of Murray in Kyrgios. Both are hot-headed, emotional, complex characters. Their respective countries have endured a relative dearth of success which brings its own pressures. The best sportsmen are often enigmas, curious puzzles which are fiendishly difficult to solve. Both fall into that category, yet are also rampaging talents on the tennis court. And, that’s why Murray, a world-class superstar with no airs or graces, has constantly been available to help the young Australian deal with the troubles which pollute his undoubted brilliance with racquet in hand. “Dealing with criticism is hard to take, but Andy has been there and been brilliant with Nick in helping him understand the process,” a source close to Kyrgios told the Guardian. “There’s no manual on how to deal with being famous. He tells him not to get carried away when everything is going to plan and tells him straight when it starts to get ugly. Nick looks up to him more than anyone. There is no one he respects more, and seeing what Andy has achieved is all he needs to take his career forward.” The Scot is always available – text, WhatsApp, call, or email. Novak Djokovic has also opened the airwaves, something for which he has been appreciative, yet Murray is Kyrgios’s go-to man. The pair are planning a training block together in the coming months. Murray, a relentless athlete in the gym, wouldn’t invite just anyone into the sweatbox of his inner sanctum. He recognises that Kyrgios works hard off the court, even if his demeanour invites large swathes of criticism from those who are unable to see the whole picture. Certainly among his peers, the Australian isn’t shunned in the locker room or given the cold shoulder. Of course, he’s not everyone’s cup of tea. His relationship with Stan Wawrinka suffered following their unseemly bust-up last August but has now healed. Yet his tennis talents help him earn respect with others. On tour, a senior group including Murray, Jo Wilfried Tsonga, Gael Monfils, and John Isner will hang out with him in foreign climes. In hotel rooms, gaming-console duels on Fifa are keenly fought. Undoubtedly, the battles in Kyrgios’ mind are harder to combat. Yet, Murray knows the pitfalls in which younger players can find themselves. The 29-year-old has been there. Hitting the ball over the net is the straightforward part. Dealing with strains and stresses of sporting stardom, however, is a harder nut to crack and one with which Kyrgios has struggled. The meltdown in Asia was symptomatic of his inability to cope. With Tokyo tournament sponsor Yonex earmarking one of their clients, Kyrgios, as a marquee player, everyone wanted a piece. The off-court demands were incessant, yet there we no complaints. It’s all part of the game. A superb week, one of the best in his career, which resulted in a winner’s trophy, soon followed but within 48 hours, he was in Shanghai, starting all over again. No gap, no time for breathing space. The denouement was brutal and the repercussions seismic. Something had to give, and even though Sam Querrey was dispatched in straight sets, against Germany’s Mischa Zverez, he cracked. Serving underarm and arguing with fans is never a good idea. It looked awful. The critics once again had bucketloads of ammunition to unload. The firestorm blazed. How could it not? “It was terrible and Nick knows he has to do better than that,” the source said. “It was constant between Tokyo and Shanghai. Playing and doing everything else has taken its toll. “But dealing with everything that comes with being one of the best players in the world is a learning process, and that’s where someone like Andy can come in and help. Nick loves him.” Now is the time for this supremely talented student to follow his world-dominating teacher’s lead. There is no better role model. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The article discusses the unique friendship between tennis players Andy Murray and Nick Kyrgios, indicating that it could potentially save Kyrgios' career.

Prepare the muffin tin: Before starting, thoroughly wash and dry the muffin tin. Properly greasing the muffin tin is essential for the cookies to expand evenly and to avoid sticking. You can use either butter, non-stick cooking spray, or line the tin with parchment paper. Make sure to coat the tin's sides and bottoms evenly. 3. Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven according to your chosen recipe, generally between 325°F and 375°F (163°C - 190°C). 4. Portion the dough: Use a small ice cream scoop or a tablespoon to divide the cookie dough into equal portions. Make sure that each dough portion is roughly the same size, ensuring that the cookies will expand evenly across the muffin tin. 5. Shape the dough: Roll each portion of dough into a ball. Then, gently press the dough ball into the bottom of each greased muffin tin cavity, ensuring that there are no air pockets underneath. The dough should be spread evenly in the tin, but not too thin, to ensure proper expansion. 6. Keep some space between the dough balls: Avoid filling adjacent cavities in the muffin tin. This will allow for better heat circulation and even expansion of the cookies. 7. Bake: Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake according to your chosen recipe, generally between 10-15 minutes. Check regularly to ensure they don't over-bake, as cookie baking time may differ in a muffin tin compared to traditional cookie baking on a baking sheet. 8. Rotate the tin: For even baking and expansion, rotate the muffin tin halfway through the baking time. This ensures that all cookies are exposed to the same amount of heat. 9. Test for doneness: Use a toothpick to check if the cookies are done. The toothpick should come out clean or with only a few crumbs when inserted in the center. Keep an eye on color as well - cookies should be golden brown and slightly firm to the touch. 10. Cool: Once done, remove the muffin tin from the oven and allow the cookies to cool for a few minutes in the tin. Afterward, carefully remove them using a spatula or butter knife and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. 11. Troubleshooting: If the cookies don't expand evenly, consider using a different recipe or adjusting the baking time and temperature. Sometimes overmixing the dough can cause uneven expansion, so be gentle with the dough while preparing it. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully make cookies that expand evenly over the muffin tin, ensuring uniformly shaped and delicious treats for everyone to enjoy!"},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question.

I have a new situation: The water level in Large Lake was high in March, 3 feet higher in April, and 7 feet higher still in May. It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore.  But I can use this background: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year.  What is an answer for this question: When was the water level lower, in April or in March? A:","output":"To answer the question of when the water level was lower, we need to analyze the information provided: 1. The water level in Large Lake was high in March. 2.

By Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor The Queen rolled out the red carpet for China's Prime Minister Li Keqiang today as part of his three-day official visit to Britain designed to ease diplomatic tensions - and win billions of pounds in business contracts. Her Majesty welcomed Mr Li and his wife at Windsor Castle alongside Prince Andrew before crunch talks in Number 10 this afternoon. At the Downing Street meeting, China's 30 year ban on British beef is expected to be lifted. A raft of other business deals will be announced to coincide with the visit, but Mr Cameron is also under pressure to raise concerns about China’s human rights record. Mr Li's visit is seen as a breakthrough in Sino-","output":"British relations, coming after years of frosty ties between the two countries over a range of political and economic issues. It is expected that the talks in Number 10 will yield significant results, particularly in the investment and trade sectors. Both the UK and China hope to foster a stronger partnership that could reshape their bilateral relationship and contribute to their respective economic growths. During the China-UK Business Forum, held at Mansion House in London, Premier Li Keqiang signed a series of agreements with the UK government worth over £18 billion. These deals involve investments in key British industries such as energy, infrastructure, and financial services. Among the most notable projects is the planned construction of a new nuclear power plant in Somerset, England, which will be jointly financed by Chinese and French firms. In addition to opening up new trade opportunities, the agreements are expected to create thousands of jobs in both countries. Mr Li's visit also witnessed the launch of a joint China-UK research and development fund aimed at fostering innovation and collaboration in science and technology. However, the visit has not been without its controversies. Prior to Mr Li's arrival in the UK, British MPs and human rights activists voiced their concerns about China's record on human rights. They urged Prime Minister David Cameron to raise these issues during his meeting with the Chinese Premier. Despite these concerns, the UK government sees the benefits of engaging with China too important to be overshadowed by the human rights issues. In a statement, Mr Cameron said, \\"We will not shy away from discussing human rights in our conversations with the Chinese, but we also recognize the enormous economic opportunities presented by greater cooperation with China.\\" As part of the diplomacy surrounding Mr Li's visit, both sides agreed to enhance cultural, education, and tourism exchanges. The British Museum and China’s Palace Museum signed a memorandum of understanding to work together on special exhibitions and artifact loans. Moreover, several British universities signed agreements with Chinese institutions to establish joint research projects. In summary, Mr Li Keqiang's visit to the UK marks a significant milestone in Sino-British relations as it paves the way for enhanced political and economic cooperation. The several billion-pound deals signed indicate a renewed interest in fostering a strategic partnership that will benefit both countries economically, while also addressing some of the longstanding concerns such as human rights. While critics argue that engaging with China without confronting its human rights record could send the wrong message, the UK government believes that open dialogue and cooperation will ultimately lead to stronger ties and a better understanding of shared values and common interests."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Critics argue that his decisions and management style led to negative outcomes and long-lasting consequences, particularly in regard to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a recent interview, however, Rumsfeld defended his record against these critics. Rumsfeld's Tenure at the Department of Defense (Step 2: Provide a brief overview of Rumsfeld's tenure to bring context to the differing perspectives) Rumsfeld served as the U.S. Secretary of Defense twice: first from 1975 to 1977 under President Gerald Ford, and later from 2001 to 2006 under President George W. Bush. During his second term, he oversaw the U.S. military's involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was known for his confrontational and no-nonsense approach to defense management, which won him admiration from some and criticism from others. The Criticism Against Rumsfeld (Step 3: Outline the main points of criticism against Rumsfeld) Many of Rumsfeld's critics argue that his aggressive approach to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan led to poor strategy, planning, and execution. Specific points of contention include: 1. The insufficient number of troops deployed, which some argue contributed to the growth of insurgent groups and the protraction of the wars. 2. His insistence on a \\"light footprint\\" approach, which may have weakened the U.S. military's effectiveness on the ground. 3. A perceived lack of adequate preparation for post-invasion governance in Iraq, particularly following the disbanding of the Iraqi military. 4. Allegations of prisoner mistreatment at Abu Ghraib during Rumsfeld's leadership, which many believe damaged the U.S.'s global reputation. Rumsfeld Defends His Record (Step 4: Summarize Rumsfeld's defense of his record) In response to these criticisms, Rumsfeld has defended not only his record but also the broader approach that he and the Bush administration took to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His key arguments include: 1. The belief that deploying a larger number of troops would have worsened the situation by causing more resentment among local populations. 2. The conviction that a lighter footprint allowed for greater flexibility in a rapidly changing geopolitical climate. 3. The argument that, despite complications, the removal of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban from power ultimately made the world a safer place. 4. His assertion that he personally took steps to address the Abu Ghraib allegations once they became known to him, emphasizing that those actions were ultimately the responsibility of a small number of individuals. Conclusion (Step 5: Offer an objective analysis, leaving readers to form their own opinions) As is often the case with high-ranking government officials, Rumsfeld's tenure at the Department of Defense is a complex and polarizing subject. As critics continue to scrutinize his decisions and management style, Rumsfeld still vehemently defends his record as Defense Secretary. Ultimately, it is up to historians and the public to weigh the arguments on both sides and decide the lasting impact of Rumsfeld's time in office."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is not an international standard unit, and its conversion factors may vary slightly depending on the particular region. In general terms, a marla is equal to an area of 9 square karams. A karam (also spelled as a gattha or gaz) is another traditional unit of length commonly used in India and Pakistan, and it can be converted to more familiar units such as yards or meters. One karam is usually recognized as equivalent to 5.5 feet or 1.67 meters. So, to determine the area in square yards, we first need to convert marla into square karams and then into square yards. As mentioned earlier, 1 marla is equal to 9 square karams. Now, we will convert this to square yards. Since 1 karam is equivalent to approximately 5.5 feet, one square karam will be equal to (5.5 ft x 5.5 ft) which equals 30.25 square feet. Now knowing that 1 marla = 9 square karams and 1 square karam = 30.25 square feet, we can now convert marla to square feet: 1 marla * 9 square karams/marla * 30.25 square feet/square karam = 272.25 square feet As there are 9 square feet in 1 square yard, we can now convert the value of marla in square feet to square yards: 272.25 square feet * (1 square yard / 9 square feet) = 30.25 square yards Hence, 1 marla is equivalent to approximately 30.25 square yards. It is essential to note that this conversion is based on the standard value adopted for one karam (5.5 feet) and can vary depending on the location or local customs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Advanced age was significantly associated with increased SARS-related deaths, primarily due to the onset of early-and late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis. Infection of aged, but not young, mice with recombinant viruses bearing spike glycoproteins derived from early human or palm civet isolates resulted in death accompanied by pathological changes associated with ARDS. In aged mice, a greater number of differentially expressed genes were observed than in young mice, whose responses were significantly delayed. Differences between lethal and nonlethal virus phenotypes in aged mice could be attributed to differences in host response kinetics rather than virus kinetics. SARS-CoV infection induced a range of interferon, cytokine, and pulmonary wound-healing genes, as well as several genes associated with the onset of ARDS. Mice that died also showed unique transcriptional profiles of immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and stress. Cytokines associated with ARDS were significantly upregulated in animals experiencing lung pathology and lethal disease, while the same animals experienced downregulation of the ACE2 receptor. These data suggest that the magnitude and kinetics of a disproportionately strong host innate immune response contributed to severe respiratory stress and lethality. Although the molecular mechanisms governing ARDS pathophysiology remain unknown in aged animals, these studies reveal a strategy for dissecting the genetic pathways by which SARS-CoV infection induces changes in the host response, leading to death.","output":"Title: \\"Age-Related Susceptibility in SARS-CoV Infections: Dissecting Molecular Mechanisms, Immune Responses, and ARDS Pathophysiology\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1993 our then PM Paul Keating travelled to Balmoral to inform the Queen she was \\"an anachronism\\". Yet on the Queen's tour Down Under to open the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, beaming crowds turned out for her. A poll revealed that support for the monarchy is at its highest level for 20 years. So, to use Aussie vernacular, what the bloody hell's goin' on? Fan ... author Kathy Lette Well, first there's the Wills and Kate factor. That handsome couple are so disarmingly charming, so young and fun and full of rock star glamour, they've become the monarchy's stealth weapon. Then there's the \\"last chance to see\\" element. At 85, this is probably the Queen's final Antipodean jaunt. Plus, recessions always ignite a chronic case of nostalgia-itis. The Queen reminds us of a time when all problems were solved by putting the kettle on. The hardest drug we took was coke  as in cola. Aids, al-Qaeda, global warming and immigration were not gnawing at the national psyche. The White Australia policy, from 1901 to 1973, barred immigration to anyone black or even vaguely beige. The Queen's dedication and dignity have also endeared her to even the most hardened anti-monarchist. Buck Palace threw a bit of a barbie for Aussies a couple of weeks ago. It proved most amusing to see how the republicans' knees gave way as they approached Her Maj, explaining their unexpected bobs as the sudden flaring up of an old tennis injury. Even though we share a sense of humour and history, a love of Milligan, Monty Python, cricket and Dickens etc, Australia is no longer a land of cuppas and cucumber sandwiches. Post-White Australia policy, the government implemented an ambitious immigration drive. Australia is now a human minestrone. It is part of Asia, and not just geographically. There are economic ties too  our wealth is due to digging up our back yard and selling it to China. So, before you Brits get all smug about the death of republicanism, I'd just like to add that Stephen Fry is also currently drawing huge crowds Down Under. You see? We're fond of all kinds of Queens, but it doesn't mean we want to be ruled by them. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about how Australians seem to be showing more support for the monarchy and Queen. The writer explains that the increasing support could be because of the charm of Prince William and Kate, the young and popular royal couple. Also, since the Queen is 85 years old, this might be her last visit to Australia, so people want to see her one last time. The writer also mentions how the Queen's dedication and dignity have won over even those who don't like the monarchy. However, in the end, the writer points out that Australians also enjoy other famous figures from the UK, like Stephen Fry, and that doesn't mean they want to be ruled by them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"A man in a plaid shirt and a blue helmet holds onto a blue rope while hanging against some large boulders.\\", does this mean that \\"The man in a plaid shirt is walking along the ground.\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"A man in a plaid shirt and a blue helmet holds onto a blue rope while hanging against some large boulders\\" does not imply that \\"The man in a plaid shirt is walking along the ground.\\" Here are some detailed reasons about why these two statements don't align: 1. Different Scenarios: The situations described in both the statements are entirely different. The first statement describes a scenario where a man is hanging against some large boulders. This implies that the man could be rock climbing or rappelling as he's holding onto a rope and has a helmet for safety, which are common gear for such activities. On the other hand, the second statement describes a situation where a man is simply walking along the ground, a casual scenario that doesn't require any particular gear or equipment. 2. Location Context: The location that each of the man's actions take place is different in the two scenarios. Hanging against boulders suggests that the man is in a mountainous or rocky terrain, possibly partaking in an adventure sport. Walking on the ground is a general statement that could be applicable anywhere, from city sidewalks to country trails, indoors or outdoors, and doesn't convey any specific adventure or activity, unlike the first statement. 3. Activity Level: There is also a difference in the physical exertion level in both these scenarios. Hanging against some large boulders while holding onto a rope is a physically strenuous activity that requires strength, skill, and possibly training. It is an adventurous situation that can be associated with thrill and risk. Conversely, walking along the ground is a routine activity undertaken by people daily, without needing any specific skills or physical abilities. 4. Safety Equipment: In the first statement, the man is wearing a helmet, which is often symbolic of situations where there may be an element of danger or risk. Conversely, the second statement mentions no such protective gear, suggesting a more mundane, less hazardous scenario. To summarize, based on the descriptions given, it is not valid to conclude that the man in the plaid shirt who is hanging against some large boulders is also walking along the ground. The first statement paints a picture of a man possibly engaged in a thrilling outdoor sporting activity, while the second statement refers to a more common daily activity of walking.

Instead, they would travel about, here and there, in search of food, wherever it was to be found. And when the food ran out, they would move off somewhere else. He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals. This was an important discovery, because by learning to cultivate the land, and care for animals, mankind would always have food steadily available.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated 3 to 5 million, to charity. His charitable work continued with the release of \\"We Are the World\\" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned 63 million, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragan received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making 40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included \\"Everyday People\\" (1968), Len Barry's \\"1-2-3\\" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's \\"The Wanderer\\" (1961) and \\"Runaround Sue\\" (1961).

At a certain temperature, (usually between 1,500 °F (820 °C) and 1,600 °F (870 °C), depending on carbon content), the base metal of steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms in its crystal matrix, called allotropy. This allows the small carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal, diffusing into the iron matrix. When this happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in solution, or mixed with the iron, forming a single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called austenite. If the steel is cooled slowly, the iron will gradually change into its low temperature allotrope. When this happens the carbon atoms will no longer be soluble with the iron, and will be forced to precipitate out of solution, nucleating into the spaces between the crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, being formed of two phases; the carbon (carbide) phase cementite, and ferrite. This type of heat treatment produces steel that is rather soft and bendable. However, if the steel is cooled quickly the carbon atoms will not have time to precipitate. When rapidly cooled, a diffusionless (martensite) transformation occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform intrinsically when the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, making it very hard and brittle.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs  for moving cautiously. \\"There's no prize for getting it quick,\\" said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. \\"There's more of a prize for getting it right.\\" Question: What is the main idea about the passage?

Movie title: The Invasion Context: An alien lifeform, much like a fungus or spore, clings to the space shuttle Patriot as it crashes back to Earth, spreading tainted debris from Texas to Washington, D.C. Curious onlookers steal, touch and even sell the parts on eBay, much like what happened with the Columbia disaster. This in turn infects many people, robbing them of their emotions when they enter REM sleep.One of the first people infected is Tucker (Jeremy Northam), a CDC director investigating the crash. Once he is overcome, Tucker uses the CDC to spread the disease further, disguising the spores as flu inoculations. In a panic from a made-up \\"flu bug,\\" people rush to get \\"inoculated,\\" later becoming pod people when they sleep that night.Tucker's ex-wife, psychiatrist Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman), knows something is amiss and, after locating several patients who say their loved ones are \\"imposters,\\" teams up with love interest and fellow doctor Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) to uncover what is really going on.With the help of Ben's friend Galeano (Jeffrey Wright), a biologist, they find out about the spore and discover that it takes over the brain during REM sleep. They also find out that people who have suffered diseases that affect the makeup of the brain, such as syphilis or ADEM, are immune to the spore because their previous diseases prevent the spore from \\"latching on\\" to the brain matter. Carol's son Oliver (Jackson Bond) is immune to the spore because of scarlet fever-type symptoms he had as a young child. Also seen immune is one of Carol's patients, Wendy Lenk, who escaped to her sister's house. On her way to her office, Carol sees several people crying and distraught and a homeless man having some sort of fit. When she gets to her office, Carol remembers what Wendy said about her husband not being her husband and searches on the Internet for similar responses. Suddenly, her secretary (infected) makes her favorite tea and infects it to spread the disease to her. Carol is about to drink the tea but receives a call from Ben and she...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 - 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Context: Dr. Havelock Ellis' 1933 book, Psychology of Sex, is one of the many manifestations of his interest in human sexuality. In this book, he goes into vivid detail of how children can experience sexuality differently in terms of time and intensity. He mentions that it was previously believed that, in childhood, humans had no sex impulse at all. \\"If it is possible to maintain that the sex impulse has no normal existence in early life, then every manifestation of it at that period must be 'perverse,'\\" he adds. He continues by stating that, even in the early development and lower function levels of the genitalia, there is a wide range of variation in terms of sexual stimulation. He claims that the ability of some infants producing genital reactions, seen as \\"reflex signs of irritation\\" are typically not vividly remembered. Since the details of these manifestations are not remembered, there is no possible way to determine them as pleasurable. However, Ellis claims that many people of both sexes can recall having agreeable sensations with the genitalia as a child. \\"They are not (as is sometimes imagined) repressed.\\" They are, however, not usually mentioned to adults. Ellis argues that they typically stand out and are remembered for the sole contrast of the intense encounter to any other ordinary experience.  Ellis claims that sexual self-excitement is known to happen at an early age. He references authors like Marc, Fonssagrives, and Perez in France who published their findings in the nineteenth century. These early ages are not strictly limited to ages close to puberty as can be seen in their findings. These authors provide cases for children of both sexes who have masturbated from the age of three or four. Ellis references Robie's findings that boys' first sex feelings appear between the ages of five and fourteen. For girls, this age ranges from eight to nineteen. For both sexes, these first sexual experiences arise more frequently during the later years as opposed to the earlier years. Ellis then references Hamilton's studies that found twenty percent of males and fourteen percent of females have pleasurable experiences with their sex organs before the age of six. This is only supplemented by Ellis' reference to Katharine Davis' studies, which found that twenty to twenty-nine percent of boys and forty-nine to fifty-one percent were masturbating by the age of eleven. However, in the next three years after, boys' percentages exceeded that of girls.  Dr. Ellis also contributed to the idea of varying levels of sexual excitation. He asserts it is a mistake to assume all children experience are able to experience genital arousal or pleasurable erotic sensations. He proposes cases where an innocent child is led to believe that stimulation of the genitalia will result in a pleasurable erection. Some of these children may fail and not be able to experience this either pleasure or an erection until puberty. Ellis concludes, then, that children are capable of a \\"wide range of genital and sexual aptitude.\\" Ellis even considers ancestry as contributions to different sexual excitation levels, stating that children of \\"more unsound heredity\\" and/or hypersexual parents are \\"more precociously excitable.\\" Question: What's the name of his book? Answer:","output":"Henry Havelock Ellis' book is called \\"Psychology of Sex.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Throughout the Art Issue, we celebrate a variety of women who are both the creators and subjects of their artistic work, and the Kylie feature aims to unpack Kylie's status as both engineer of her image and object of attention.

She said her first thought when she saw Kylie's controversial cover was, \\"Not again.\\"      \\"It's common for fashion magazines and models to use wheelchairs or other mobility aids to look 'edgy,\\" she commented. \\"I would much rather that disabled models were used if a photographer really wanted to do a certain concept using wheelchairs, etc. But most of the time the models used are able-bodied.\\"      \\"I guess what I and many other disabled people really want is just to be given the same opportunities as everyone else,\\" she added. \\"If disabled people weren't excluded from the fashion world then there would be no problem with able-bodied people using wheelchairs in fashion. It would all be equal. But right now we're almost invisible and so what I hope for is more visibility. More opportunity and more acceptance of the disabled body.\\"      Richardson said she doesn't want an apology from Kylie, but rather, an \\"explanation.\\"      \\"Mostly, I'd like an explanation of how not one person at the magazine, nor Kylie herself, or her manager/mother thought, 'Maybe this could hurt people,'\\" she mused. \\"An apology would be lovely but it's not completely necessary.

In December, Jenner caused controversy by posing in a wheelchair for a photoshoot with Interview magazine.      In contrast, the claim describes Minogue as an “internationally renowned performing artist, humanitarian, and breast cancer activist”.      Minogue is no stranger to trademarking names. She currently owns the terms “Kylie Minogue”, “Kylie Minogue Darling” (the name of her perfume brand) and “Lucky – the Kylie Minogue musical”.

As pillowy as they've become over the last few years, the 17-year-old continues to claim she has not had plastic surgery and is simply a makeup maven. Uh huh. Teen girls are calling her bluff by doing something bizarre to achieve Kylie lips and posting their bruised, battered, and inflated lip photos on Twitter with the hash tag #KylieJennerChallenge. Sigh.      In an effort to get bigger lips, teens participating in the challenge are cramming their lips inside of shot glasses and sucking. The results are insanely disturbing—particularly because many of the participants look a lot younger than Kylie. Here's a video of one teen performing the challenge:      And another video:      Several photos on Twitter look similar to this one, which shows a young girl's bruised lips after she took the #KylieJennerChallenge:      This challenge is risky, according to experts, who are warning teens that the shot glass can break while they're sucking, leading to cuts and injuries. While I agree no one should try this stupid stunt because they could get hurt, I'd argue there's an even better reason not to attempt this stupid stunt: you're emulating a reality TV star who has yet to win a world record, write a song, help build an orphanage, graduate college, or even vote in an election.      In short: challenging yourself to look more like a cartoon character is beyond bizarre and sad.      More from The Stir: Kylie Jenner's Huge Lips Can Finally Be Explained      At first, I thought: maybe these teens are poking fun at Kylie and showing the world how silly it is to pump up your lips to artificial proportions. Surely, no one thinks they look good like this, right? If they could find some way to take that stand using makeup, and not a shot glass, I'd be all for it.      I hope I'm right. I hope this is all just a wacky joking way of trying to prove that natural is best—but I also fear the message this sends out is that Kylie's lips are something we should all try and achieve, regardless of whether big lips are in our genes.      When I was younger, the world of plastic surgery wasn't accessible to teens. In our eyes, it was a bizarre universe inhabited only by a small percentage of Park Avenue socialites, most of whom were in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. We wouldn't have even dreamed of going under the knife—it just wasn't part of teen culture.      It makes me sad to know that Kylie and other really young people are, whether they realize it or not, promoting plastic surgery and obscenely exaggerated body enhancements.

KDB, an Australian-based business representing Minogue, argues that if the US Patent and Trademark Office approved Jenner’s application then it would cause confusion among consumers and dilute the pop singer’s brand.      In its opposition, KDB said Jenner was a ““secondary reality television personality” who appeared as “a supporting character” on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and who has been criticized by disability rights groups and African American communities.      Kylie Minogue Splits With Roc Nation      Minogue has addressed the dispute in a message to her 2.3 million Twitter followers. “Hello... My name is KYLIE #lightyears”, she wrote, lifting a lyric from her 2000 song \\"Light Years\\".      Hello.....

Her trophy room includes Brit Awards, Grammys and in 2007 she became the first-ever woman (and first foreigner) to receive Britain's prestigious Music Industry Trusts' Award. In 2011, she was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. She has owned the domain name kylie.com since Aug. 21, 1996, a year before Jenner was born, The Mirror reports.

Everybody knows this and nobody would think of questioning this fact. Yet there are many people who do not seem to know that memory works in the same way.

When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he doesn't give it enough chances to become strong.  If a friend complains that his arms and legs are weak, we know that it is his own fault. But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think his parents are to blame and that he is just unlucky, and few of us realize that it is just as much as his own fault as if it is his arms or legs that were weak.

Question: Given the following context:  About to nervously jump off a bridge, scrawny Harry Berlin is a barely functional human being. Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him.  As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her. Milt and Ellen plot to get back together and convince Harry to divorce her but he loves her and sets out to prove it by getting a job as an elevator operator in a shopping mall.  answer the following question:  Who does Linda dump?

To her, any kind of sex is casual, and it doesn't matter who she does it with or when, as long as she gets it.At graduation she falls asleep, proving she has little interest for the norms of prize-givings or anything to do with what's accepted by society. At her father's birthday party she is under dressed and is of course moaned at by her hypocritical mother. Here we learn that her parent's friends are just as false as what is accepted by everyone.

All the nursing staff and the patients are kept marginally sane by Valerie, and she and Susanna have a complex relationship.

Imagine when you leave your toys outside and they get all yucky because of the air and weather. The same thing happens to cookies if we leave them out. So we need to keep them safe and cozy. Here's a fun and easy way to keep cookies moist: 1. Find a clean, airtight container. This can be a box with a lid that fits tightly. This is like a little house for cookies to keep them away from the outside air. 2. Put a piece of bread in the box with the cookies. I know, bread sounds strange, right? But the cookies and the bread will play a little game. The cookies will take the moisture from the bread, so they stay soft and yummy, while the bread will become hard. Never store cookies when they're still warm; let them cool first, just like you have to wait for your bath water to cool down a bit. Remember to eat the cookies within a week, it's their game over time. If they stay longer, they might not taste as good.  Also remember not to put in too many cookies in one box. They need space, just like you need space to play and run around."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Owls  are some of the world's greatest hunters. From head to feet, owls' bodies are built to hunt. Scientists are studying all the things that make owls such great hunters. Most owls hunt at night. The birds have excellent hearing, which helps them find their next meal in the dark. Owls have one ear that is larger and set higher than the other. When an owl hears a sound, it listens closely. Is the sound lounder in its right ear or left ear? Does the upper or lower ear detect the sound first? The information helps the owl find the location of its prey without ever seeing it. Owls don't depend just on their hearing to hunt. After a sound draws an owl's attention, it zeroes in with sight. Many birds have eyes on either side of their heads. But an owl's eyes face forward, like a person's. Images from each eye combine to form a 3-D picture, similar to how we see. That helps owls better judge a prey's size, distance, and speed. An owl's eyes are so large that they can gather lots of light. That helps the owl see better when hunting at night. An owl's eyes are also fixed in their sockets . It can't roll them like we can. Instead, an owl keeps prey in its sight by turning its head. Owls can move their beads nearly upside down and turn them 270 degrees around. Their necks have 14 vertebrae . That's twice as many neck bones as a person has. The blood vessels  thread through holes in an owl's vertebrae. The researchers found that these holes are very large so that the extra space provides an air cushion that protects the vessels. Detecting prey is only the first step for owls. Next they must catch their meals. An owl can fly inches over your head and you can't hear anything. The secret to owls' silent flight is their feathers. Fine \\"hairs\\" cover the surface of an owl's wing feathers. And the feathers' edges have soft barbs . Together, they make the sound of air rushing over the owl's wings quieter and less clear.

Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean.

Use a fire extinguisher: This is a special red canister that sprays a special material that stops the fire. It works by taking away the oxygen the fire needs to burn. Always ask an adult to help you use a fire extinguisher. 3. Smother the fire: Covering the fire with a thick, non-flammable material like a fire blanket or even a large pot lid can help block the oxygen the fire needs. This will make it harder for the fire to breathe and help put it out. Make sure an adult helps you with this.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.  - A coucal is one of about 30 species of birds in the cuckoo family. All of them belong in the subfamily Centropodinae and the genus Centropus. Unlike many Old World cuckoos, coucals are not brood parasites. On the other hand, they do have their own reproductive peculiarity: all members of the genus are to varying degrees sex-role reversed so that the smaller male provides most of the parental care. At least one coucal species, the black coucal, is polyandrous. Some species (\\"Centropus phasianinus\\") have the male investing more in incubation and parental care. Recent DNA evidence suggests that they should be raised to family status, as Centropodidae.  - The true koels, Eudynamys, are a genus of cuckoos from Asia, Australia and the Pacific. They are large sexually dimorphic cuckoos which eat fruits and insects and have loud distinctive calls. They are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other species.  - Malkohas are large birds in the cuckoo family Cuculidae, all in the genus Phaenicophaeus. The group name is derived from the Sinhala word for the red-faced malkoha; Mal-Koha meaning flower-cuckoo. These are all Asian tropical species. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"phoiniko-\\" \\"crimson\\", and \\"phaes\\" \\"eyes\\" or \\"face\\", referring to the red-faced malkoha. However, the 'œ' was mistranscribed as 'æ'.  - The cuckoos are a family of birds, Cuculidae, the sole taxon in the order Cuculiformes. The cuckoo family includes the common or European cuckoo, roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis. The coucals and anis are sometimes separated as distinct families, the Centropodidae and Crotophagidae respectively.  - In paleogeography, Gondwana, also Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient supercontinent. It is believed to have sutured between about 573 and 510 million years ago (Mya), joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. Gondwana formed prior to Pangaea, and later became part of it.  - Couas are large , mostly terrestrial birds of the cuckoo family , endemic to the island of Madagascar . Coua derives from koa , the Malagasy name for a cuckoo or coua , which is in turn an onomatopoeic of some species ' call notes . Reminiscent of African turacos when walking along tree branches , they likewise feature brightly coloured bare skin around the eyes . Some resemble coucals in their habit of clambering through plant tangles while foraging , while the arboreal species move between tree canopies with gliding flight . Four species occur ( red ) in rainforests while the remaining six are found in the dry forests of western and southern Madagascar . They have large feet , with a reversible third toe like all cuckoos . Their long tibia suggest a relationship with the Carpococcyx ground - cuckoos of Asia , a genus with similar nestlings . Consequently , they are sometimes united in the subfamily Couinae . Couas build their own nests and lay white eggs . Couas ' calls are short series of evenly spaced notes , which are sometimes answered by other individuals .    What entity does 'coua' has the relation 'parent taxon' with? Answer:","output":"Coua has the relation 'parent taxon' with the family of birds called Cuculidae. The Cuculidae family comprises cuckoos, which includes various subgroups like coucals, anis, and couas. The Couas are large, mostly terrestrial birds of the cuckoo family, endemic to the island of Madagascar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How long is the play in Edinburgh?

Smartphones do make our lives easier. But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of the British people own smartphones and they spend an average (  ) of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the U.K who suffer from short-sightedness   since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring  at smartphones for a long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink   a certain number of times. However, when you look at the things closer to your face, the blink slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphone in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils   become larger, too much light goes into your eyes. This can be bad for your eyes and causes a disease called glaucoma  . Maybe it is possible for you to stop using your smartphone, but there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes. * Hold your phone at least 30 centimeters away from your eyes when using it. *Take a break every hour and try the following: look at something at least 5 meters away from you and then focus on your nose.

Here's a detailed analysis of the various aspects of the tweet: 1. The tweet starts with \\"@ryan_s great news!\\" which indicates a positive sentiment. The user is sharing \\"great news\\" with another user (@ryan_s), implying that something good has happened or has been communicated. In this instance, the tweet is definitely leaning towards a positive sentiment. 2. The next part of the tweet, \\"Poor Dave,\\" indicates sympathy for a person named Dave. This could imply that something unfortunate has happened to Dave, or he's in a situation that merits sympathy from the author of the tweet. This part of the tweet leans towards a negative sentiment. Taking both of these components into consideration, the overall sentiment of the tweet can be described as a mix of both positive and negative emotions. It's important to note that sentiment analysis is not always black and white, and social media communication can be nuanced and multifaceted.

A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing and a proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency. Classify whether the question is answerable or not based on the given context. Input: proper question: What gives sedimentary rock its characteristic fabric?   disfluent question: What changes the mineral content of a rock or wait I want to know what gives sedimentary rock its characteristic fabric?   context: There are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock, and magma. When a rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock may also be re-eroded and redeposited, and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism. All three types of rocks may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize. Output:","output":"The given proper question is: What gives sedimentary rock its characteristic fabric? The disfluent question is: What changes the mineral content of a rock or wait I want to know what gives sedimentary rock its characteristic fabric? Now, let's analyze the context: The context explains that there are three major types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle illustrates the relationships between these types of rocks and magma. The transformation of an igneous rock into a sedimentary rock, or a sedimentary rock into a metamorphic rock, changes the mineral content of the rock, which gives it a characteristic fabric.  Considering the context, we can understand that the characteristic fabric of sedimentary rocks is a result of being weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified after transforming from either igneous or metamorphic rocks. Based on the context, both the proper question and the disfluent question are answerable. The answer to the questions is that the characteristic fabric of sedimentary rocks is given by the weathering, erosion, deposition, and lithification processes that they undergo during their formation as part of the rock cycle."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The amazing December turnaround of the Philadelphia Eagles continued with another road win over a division rival. Philadelphia's surprising 23-7 Christmas Day victory over the Dallas Cowboys was broadcast on national television and clinched a playoff spot. Jeff Garcia, who outshined fellow backup-turned starting quarterback Tony Romo, led the Eagles to scores on four of their first five possessions. Capping off their first drive, which took 7:12 off the clock, Garcia hit tight end Matt Schobel for a 25-yard touchdown. Cowboys' return man Miles Austin fumbled the ensuing kickoff to Quintin Mikell. However, Dallas cornerback Anthony Henry intercepted Garcia and the Cowboys drove to the Eagles' 1-yard line. From there, the Philadelphia defense stuffed Dallas goal-line back Marion Barber III on three straight plays. The ball turned over on downs and Garcia promptly found Dont&#233; Stallworth for a 39-yard gain. The drive finished with a David Akers field goal and the Eagles led 10-0. Romo and the Cowboys responded with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, who only caught two passes for 23 yards on the game. With only&#160;:29 seconds left in the half, Garcia got the Eagles into field goal range, and David Akers connected on a 45-yarder to make it 13-7 as time expired. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Garcia beat a Dallas blitz and completed a 65-yard catch and run to L.J. Smith. Philadelphia finished the drive with another field goal and it was 16-7. Early in the fourth quarter, Brian Dawkins made an over the shoulder interception in front of Owens in the end zone. On a 6:57 drive that included ten running plays and broke the Cowboys' backs, Correll Buckhalter pounded it in from one yard out, increasing the lead to 23-7. Romo would throw another interception, this one to Lito Sheppard, and the Eagles' domination of the Dallas offense continued for the rest of the game. The Eagles ran the ball a whopping 42 times for 204 yards (with Brian Westbrook accounting for 122 of those yards), while Garcia and the passing game gained 238 yards. The defense recorded three sacks in addition to the two interceptions and held Dallas to a meager 201 total yards on their own turf. Philadelphia clinches a playoff berth, and now suddenly controls the NFC East and can win the division with a win over the Atlanta Falcons or a Dallas loss.

Summarize this article: They were killed when a gunman, with links to Islamic State extremists, opened fire on a beach in Sousse, outside two hotels. He had hidden a gun under a beach umbrella and also threw grenades, forcing people to run for their lives. Some survivors have been speaking about their ordeal. Full coverage of the Sousse attack Angela Evans and her friend lay face down in the sand playing dead as the gunman passed. \\"We both looked up, stood up, there was this man there in black, several rows of sun loungers away just stood there with his huge gun moving round all the people shooting them, just killing, murdering them. \\"You can't run, you're an open target running, he was shooting anyone on their feet as well as people on sun loungers, he was just killing them. \\"So we both at the same time, [said] play dead, we just fell to the ground, faces in the sand. \\"The shooting continued. He just kept on shooting, it was coming nearer and nearer. Then his feet were at the side of me. \\"You don't move, because you're next. You just pray to God. \\"Then there was this noise, this heavy clicking noise, into the sand fell part of the gun, a magazine... You still have to pretend you're dead. \\"And then click again. He put more bullets in. \\"And then there was a noise. I don't know what noise, just a noise. I could feel him move and the shooting started again.\\" Ms Evans, from King's Lynn in Norfolk, described hearing the gunman leave the beach towards a hotel. When the pair thought it was safe, they ran to another hotel. She said staff there hid her and her friend in an office until it was over. Saera Wilson said her fiance Matthew James, 30, from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, was trying to protect her during the gunfire and used his body as a human shield. Ms Wilson, 26, said Mr James was hit in the shoulder, chest and hip. Speaking from the hospital where Mr James, known as Sas, is being treated, Ms Wilson said: \\"He took a bullet for me. I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started. \\"He was covered in blood from the shots, but he just told me to run away.\\" Shelley Hay, 25, and Ben Milton, 24, from Cardiff, were on the beach with sunbathers when the attack began. Ms Hay told the BBC: \\"I heard what I thought were fireworks and looked to the left of me and the whole beach was running, it was like a stampede. \\"I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were shots - from what I know now as I could see sand flying in the air - I believe it was bullets hitting the floor and the sand was just hitting back, so we just ran.\\" The couple got engaged hours later. Mr Milton proposed after deciding to \\"not let them stop me.\\" Fourteen-year-old Bronwyn Slater was in the sea with her mum when the gunman began firing. \\"We just heard these sounds like bang, bang, bang bang. We just proper ran to my dad. It were terror and shock and sorrow. Then I had to proper sprint for my life really, to survive,\\" she told the BBC. The three of them ran to a shop where they hid in a cupboard for two-and-a-half hours, listening to gun shots and hand grenades being detonated on either side of them. It must have been frightening, said BBC Today presenter John Humphrys. \\"Frightening? It's unbelievable. It's shocking as well and terrifying really,\\" said Bronwyn. Listen to the full interview on BBC Radio Four's Today programme One survivor has spoken about how he was hidden in a hotel laundry room by hotel staff. John Carter, who was on holiday with his wife Lynn, ran into his hotel's kitchen area after hearing gunfire and was hidden in the laundry room. Mr Carter, from Hull said he lost sight of his wife after stopping briefly to urge an older man to run. \\"Then there were big explosions and then gunshots,\\" he said. \\"You didn't know what was going on, and you just saw some legs under where we were hid and they were shouting at them to get in with us, and then someone fell on top of me and it was my wife.\\" Couple Becky Catterick, 19, and Mark Barlow, 24, from Scunthorpe were protected from the gunman by local shopkeepers. Miss Catterick said: \\"We didn't want to say goodbye, but he just kept getting closer so we just all told each other we loved each other.\\" \\"We thought it was the end,\\" Mr Barlow added. Jac Randell, from Cardiff, was on holiday in the resort of Sousse with his partner Hollie Nicklin when the gunman opened fire on Friday. Mr Randell said they ran from the attacker expecting to get shot in the back. \\"Hotel staff formed a line of protection around the hotel. They were prepared to take the bullets for us. You can't thank them enough,\\" he said. One British tourist in Tunisia, whose name was only given as Danny, took refuge under a table with his wife, hearing ''guns and grenades and explosions'' around them. ''I hid under a table and kissed my wife goodbye, thinking that was going to be the end'' he said. Listen to his story A couple from Manchester told the BBC that the gunman was \\"killed about 400 yards\\" from where they were hiding. Olivia Leathley, who was on holiday in Sousse, said she saw \\"hundreds of people running and screaming from the beach,\\" before she managed to hide with her boyfriend, Mike Jones, in a small security lodge. Melanie Callaway, 45, from Hedge End, Hampshire had just been in the sea with her friend Paula Gill, 48, when the shooting started. \\"It was absolutely manic - people were just screaming 'run for your life', 'get off the beach - just run'. It was like a tsunami film where everyone was just running up the beach towards their hotels. \\"We had a five-minute run up the footpath with no shoes on,\\" said Mrs Callaway. The pair barricaded themselves in their room in the Royal Kenz Hotel for five hours with a mattress pushed up against the door. Debbie Horsfall was on holiday in Tunisia and flew back on Saturday morning. She described to the BBC how her friend noticed the gunman, and raised the alarm by shouting ''run, there's a gun''. Graeme Scott, from Irchester, Northamptonshire, was in the Hotel Imperial Marharba with his parents Jen and Sid and cousin Karl when the Tunisian beach attack happened. \\"We were laying by the pool and suddenly there were gunshots - what I thought were gunshots - but dad turned round and said 'it's fire crackers'. \\"I said 'no dad it's gunshots, we have got to go'. So we all got up... and we just headed towards the foyer of the hotel. \\"We just wanted to get safe somewhere. \\"There was about 20 of us in the cellar room with the door shut just for safety and we had to just keep quiet. \\"We just feared for our lives.\\" Listen to the full interview with BBC Radio Northampton Belfast couple Robert McKenzie and his wife, Wilma, had just come out of the sea when the gunman opened fire. The couple were staying at a hotel about 300 yards from where the shooting happened. Mr McKenzie said \\"pandemonium\\" broke out. \\"Everyone was running. I hadn't heard any gunfire,\\" he said. \\"If they had come to our section of the beach, we'd have been wiped out because we always lay right at the front of the beach... and wouldn't have had a chance, quite honestly. \\"By the grace of God, it didn't happen to us.\\" Summary:","output":"A violent attack at a beach in Sousse saw individuals killed by a gunman linked to the Islamic State. He used a weapon hidden under a beach umbrella and also launched grenades, forcing people to flee. Various survivors shared stories of their experiences, including one woman and her friend who played dead to avoid being shot, and a man using his body as a shield for his fiancé. Others hid in shops, hotel offices, and laundry rooms. Staff and local shopkeepers also helped protect tourists during the attack. The event has left survivors traumatized, fearful, and thanking those who put their lives at risk to protect them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The dog didn't blink, he didn't pant, he didn't move. He just sat in the passenger seat as I drove, relaxed, mouth hanging slightly open, looking at me the way someone examines a menu but can't decide on the chicken or the veal. The desert sky was on fire when the city came into view. Cerberus turned away from me and stuck his head out from the side of the jeep, his giant tongue flapping in the eighty mile an hour wind while I dialed Luna's number.

Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Grassland. Yes or no? Answer: In temperate latitudes , such as northwestern Europe and the Great Plains and California in North America , native grasslands are dominated by perennial bunch grass species, whereas in warmer climates annual species form a greater component of the vegetation. Question: what are they like in tropical grassland in plant Answer:","output":"In tropical grasslands, also known as savannas, the plant life is characterized by a mixture of grasses and scattered trees. The grasses in these areas are usually taller than those found in temperate grasslands and include a mix of both perennial and annual species. The tree component is primarily composed of drought-resistant and fire-resistant species, such as acacias and baobabs. These adaptations allow them to survive in the tropical grassland's distinct climate, which includes a pronounced dry season and frequent fires. Overall, tropical grasslands exhibit a diverse range of plant life that can withstand the harsh environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Pick your answer from: + yes. + it is not possible to tell. + no.","output":"To determine if the hypothesis \\"Music doesn't tell stories, but just makes people happy\\" is true, let's consider the given premise and analyze the hypothesis step-by-step. Step 1: Identify the main points in the premise - Music tells stories (to varying degrees) - Charismatic power is an element in one of those stories - Music can portray force, risk-taking, and the struggle against demonic power Step 2: Consider the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that music doesn't tell stories and only makes people happy. Step 3: Compare the hypothesis to the premise The premise clearly indicates that music tells stories, including elements of struggle, risk-taking, and overcoming adversity (such as facing a demonic power). This contrasts with the hypothesis, which states that music doesn't tell stories. Step 4: Determine if the hypothesis is true, based on the premise Considering the premise, the hypothesis that \\"Music doesn't tell stories, but just makes people happy\\" is not accurate, as it contradicts the premise which mentions that music tells stories and showcases various emotional aspects.

And it had kept perfect time. But one night it happened that I forgot to _ it _  . Next morning I went to a watchmaker as I wanted my perfect watch to be set by the exact time. He examined it and said, \\"The regulator   must be pushed up as your watch is four minutes slow. I tried to stop him from doing so, but he didn't listen and pushed the regulator. My beautiful watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. By the end of the second month it had left all the clocks and watches of the town far behind. I could do nothing but take it to another watchmaker to be regulated. I expected him to regulate the watch at once, but he asked me to come in a week's time. When at last I got my watch back from him, it began to slow down. And I failed to be in time for trains, business affairs, and even missed my dinners. Now I went to a third watchmaker. When I was waiting for him to repair my poor watch, he took it to pieces and said that he would try to finish this work in three or four days. What I could do was to nod my head. After that, my watch went for half a day, and then stopped. So I kept taking my watch from one watchmaker to another. But each watchmaker disappointed me.
