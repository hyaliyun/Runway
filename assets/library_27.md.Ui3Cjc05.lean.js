Apple has announced that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are available in a total of 69 countries so it has either launched in more countries but not announced them or there are 46 more countries to get the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in the next three weeks to reach the company’s stated goal of being in 115 by the end of the year. (Note that I own Apple shares). I have been tracking Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus lead-times in a number of countries; on Verizon’s, AT&T AT&T’s, Sprint’s websites and three of Vodafone Vodafone’s around the world since Apple and its partners started taking pre-orders on Friday, September 12. I also tracked lead-times for the iPhone 4S, 5, 5c and 5s and have all the details in a Google Google Doc. I believe that by monitoring how long lead-times are and change it can give one a feeling on how supply is matching up to demand. It can also give some indication on how much sales may occur in the March quarter since it appears that Apple remains fairly supply constrained and this is before any meaningful channel fill occurs. Different lead-times for the various models and memory sizes can give an indication of which ones are in higher demand and what the iPhone’s average selling price (ASP) could be. Another factor in ASPs is how much Apple charges in other countries. I believe that Apple could hit 70 million iPhone sales in the December quarter and the demand for them can be seen in their leading positions they hold in Japan, lead-times being longer than other iPhone launches, China Mobile China Mobile’s 4G customer base exploding and Kantar’s data showing iPhones gaining share worldwide. Source: Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty Images Apple’s iPhone worldwide websites lead-times The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus lead-times have decreased over the past two weeks on the 10 Apple websites that I checked on Friday evening (9 of the original 10 initial launch countries and China). The 16GB and 32GB models have dropped from 5-7 or 7-10 business days to 3-5 days (except for the Space Gray 16GB model in Australia that is at 1-3 business days). The iPhone 6 128GB models have kept their same lead-times from two weeks ago of either 5-7 or 7-10 business days. The 6 Plus 128GB models have seen their lead-times decrease from 3-4 weeks to match the model 6’s 5-7 or 7-10 business days.","output":"The lead times for Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus still remain longer than previous models 11 weeks after their initial launch in the first wave of ten countries. Apple has announced that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are available in a total of 69 countries, with the company aiming to reach 115 by the end of the year. By tracking the lead times, analysts can monitor supply-demand matchups, which can provide an estimation of sales for the next quarter. It is believed that the longer lead times are indicative of the high demand for the smartphones, and Apple could potentially hit 70 million iPhone sales in the December quarter.

A. desk  B. grocery shop  C. house  D. antique store  E. discount store  The best answer is Answer:","output":"E. Discount Store When looking to buy a cheap book, the best place to consider is a discount store (Option E). There are several reasons why discount stores are the ideal choice for purchasing low-priced books: 1. Affordable Pricing: Discount stores specialize in offering products at lower prices than regular retail stores. They can provide books at a lower cost due to various factors, such as purchasing in bulk, product overruns, or selling last season's merchandise. 2. Wide selection of genres: You will find a broad range of book selections at a discount store, spanning various genres like fiction, non-fiction, children's books, cookbooks, and more. This wide assortment of books means you are likely to find the book you are looking for at an affordable price. 3. Sales and Promotions: Discount stores often hold seasonal sales and promotions that further reduce the cost of books. You can score a great deal during these events, making it possible to buy multiple books at a fraction of their original price. 4. Clearance Items: In addition to regular sales and promotions, discount stores may also have clearance sections where book prices are drastically reduced to make room for new inventory. This is another excellent opportunity to buy cheap books. 5. Used Books: Some discount stores also sell used books, which can be significantly cheaper than new ones. Used books might have minor wear and tear but are generally in good condition and perfect for readers looking for budget-friendly options. However, it is essential to note that while answer D, 'Antique Store,' may not seem like the best choice for a cheap book, there might be instances where you can find rare or out-of-print books at comparatively lower prices than online retailers or specialty bookstores.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang. Following the historic handshake here between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader, who inked their names to a document with vague but compelling promises, the question emanating from Sentosa's Capella Hotel was what will actually change on the Korean peninsula? Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella. Trump was elated and within the hour would make a surprising announcement suspending \\"provocative\\" joint U.S.-South Korean drills on the Korean peninsula. \\"We had a great chemistry,\\" the president, speaking to Van Susteren, said of himself and Kim. \\"We will do business.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us, \\"it's a great day.\\" The president has essentially handed off to Pompeo the hard work of turning a sparse declaration on denuclearization into something truly transformative. Many will question whether Pompeo, who a decade ago was running an oilfield equipment company, is truly the man for the task. In Pompeo's background, however, are indications of his capabilities: First in his class at the U.S. Military Academy, time served on the House of Representative's intelligence committee, a brief stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency and two meetings with Kim in Pyongyang. Perhaps he is now as astute as any American official on piecing together the Pyongyang puzzle. This correspondent — an observer of the Korean peninsula over five decades, resident in Seoul for several years and once given the opportunity to frankly converse for a week (in 2013) in the North with KPA officers — has gleaned some insight into the world's most reclusive state.

Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Kalavryta is a town and a municipality in the mountainous east-central part of the regional unit of Achaea, Greece. The town is located on the right bank of the river Vouraikos, south of Aigio, southeast of Patras and northwest of Tripoli.

Here is an article: By Anthony Breznican, USA TODAY There was less consensus on what kind of movie it was. Some described it as a coming-of-age drama. Others said it was a modern Western. More commonly, critics called it a twist on the classic detective story. The story of a teenage girl struggling to survive in the Ozark Mountains while searching for her missing father won Sundance's Grand Jury prize as well as best screenplay, settling it as one of the festival's top discoveries. The broader moviegoing public now gets to weigh in on this film's genre-fusion when Winter's Bone opens in limited release Friday and expands nationwide over the next two weeks. Director Debra Granik embraces all the different takes on her story and credits Daniel Woodrell, author of the original novel, for weaving together so many storytelling elements. \\"It's definitely a mystery in the sense that she has something to solve,\\" Granik says. \\"It's an amalgam really. Daniel was drawing on some irresistible forms of American storytelling. The Western — it's absolutely that in the sense that here's this person who has something very solid she's fighting for and needs to protect. She's met with a hostile response. She's warned. She's told to turn back. She's crossing a line, but she has to go further. But she needs to get to the end.\\" The \\"she\\" is 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), and what she needs to protect are her much-younger brother and sister, her ailing mother and their modest home. Her deadbeat father, a meth dealer who is facing a long prison sentence, put the property up as his bail bond, then promptly disappeared. The police inform her that if he doesn't show up for court, she can add homelessness to her litany of troubles, which already include being a too-soon parental guardian, nursemaid and breadwinner for the family. She'll not only have to locate him but also persuade him to turn himself in. Her quest takes even darker turns. The host of grim-faced friends and relatives scattered across the wilderness of her community are strangely resistant to helping her. If she persists, she may be the next one to vanish. But Ree keeps asking. \\"It didn't really seem like a detective story until I heard other people saying 'detective story.' And then I was like, 'Yeah. Sure! It's a detective story,' \\" Lawrence jokes. \\"It's hard because movies can affect every single person differently. But that's what movies are for.\\" In fact, the many interpretations of Winter's Bone have become a strength and a kind of Rorschach test for each viewer. \\"What Winter's Bone does is really focus in on making (the characters) seem like real individuals. The story is patient, and it's beautifully shot in such a way that it makes you feel like you're in this environment, and a lot of people are able to project what they want that story to be, because it feels so real to them,\\" says Eric Kohn, lead film critic for IndieWire.com, who says he saw it as a kind of film noir. \\"It's all of those things and works on all those different levels, because you're not being told you have to look at this movie in one particular way.\\" The film started out as more of a character study, a look at the world of a teenager who is forced too soon into adulthood with too little means. \\"There was a late-breaking embracing of these terms we're using now,\\" Granik says. \\"It wasn't really until the editing that we saw the film had palpable suspense. \\"It was a little bit of a trade-off because we had more content from her daily life in the film initially. ... In some ways, suspense becomes a very strict mistress, what she will and won't allow in a film.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Title: Night of the Comet Movie plot: The Earth is passing through the tail of a comet, an event which has not occurred in 65 million years. The last time coinciding with the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. On the night of the comet's passage, which takes place eleven days before Christmas, large crowds gather outside to watch and celebrate. 18-year-old Regina \\"Reggie\\" Belmont works at a movie theater in southern California. She is annoyed to find the initials DMK have the sixth highest score on the theater's arcade game on which all the other scores are hers. She stays after the theater closes to play until DMK's score is removed and have sex with her boyfriend Larry, the theater projectionist, in the steel-lined projection booth. Meanwhile, Reggie's 16-year-old sister Samantha \\"Sam\\" argues with their stepmother Doris, who punches her in the face. Sam then spends the night in a steel backyard shed. The next morning, a reddish haze covers everything, and there are no signs of life, only piles of red dust and heaps of clothing. Unaware that anything strange has happened, Larry goes outside and is killed by a zombie wielding a pipe wrench. When Reggie goes looking for Larry, she encounters the zombie, but escapes. She heads home to find her sister. Because both Reggie and Sam spent the night shielded from cosmic effects by steel, they were saved from the comet's effects.[3] After figuring out what has happened, they hear a disc jockey and race to the radio station, only to find it was just a recording. They come across another survivor there, Hector Gomez, who spent the night in the back of his steel truck. When Sam talks into the microphone, she is heard by researchers in an underground installation out in the desert. As they listen to Reggie, Sam and Hector debate what to do, the scientists note that the zombies, though less exposed to the comet, will eventually disintegrate into dust themselves. Hector leaves to see if any of his family survived, but promises to come back. Reggie and Sam then go shopping at a mall. After a...

Answer the following question: Why are the cats initially uncomfortable with their domicile ?","output":"The cats were initially uncomfortable with their new domicile due to the following reasons: 1. Change of environment: Cats are sensitive to changes in their environment and need time to adjust. Moving the cats to the main part of the house changed their surroundings, which could have caused them to feel uneasy at first. 2. Territory: Cats are territorial animals and may feel threatened or uneasy when moved to a new area. They need time to establish and claim the space as their own before feeling comfortable. 3. Presence of unfamiliar smells: When the cats were moved to the main part of the house, they would have encountered unfamiliar smells. Cats rely on their sense of smell for security, and new scents can be disconcerting. 4. Transition period: It is common for cats to need a transition period when adjusting to new environments. As mentioned, after a day, they were totally comfortable with the new place, indicating they just needed some time to acclimate.

This is about winning the electoral college, not national polls. National tracking polls are overrated. They were overrated when they had President Obama leading the race and they are overrated now that some polls are showing Mitt Romney ahead. There is no polling conspiracy. It’s all about perspective: The race for the White House is going to be very close and the tracking polls are going to swing back and forth for the next three weeks until election day. Today, there are two national tracking polls out that have everyone talking. First, Gallup has a seven-day tracking poll that has President Obama up five points. This differs from their three-day tracking poll that had the race tied, with both candidates 47% each -- but that didn't include polling from Sunday, when the President appeared to be rebounding. In any event, it is clear that Mitt Romney got a bounce from his \\"winning\\" performance in the first presidential debate, but the jury is still out as to whether Team Romney can turn that bounce into real momentum. Second, Pew released the first tracking poll taken completely after Obama’s dismal performance in the debate. In that, Romney is leading the race nationally by four points. It’s a shift of 12 points in favor of Romney from the last Pew poll in mid-September after the successful Democratic convention. And so begins the liberal freak out. Is that real momentum for Team Romney or is the Pew poll an outlier? The truth is that it doesn't really matter. The election is going to be close. In my previous posts, when I proclaimed Romney to be losing, I was always talking in terms of the electoral college estimates, which still show the President winning projected totals of over 300 votes, way over the 270 votes needed to win. This is about Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Iowa. This is about the battleground states. It is a fact that Romney has a much tougher road to get to 270 than does the President. Team Romney needs to run a flawless campaign and get out the vote operation in order to get to 270. It’s the electoral math that is in the President’s favor, and until that changes, tracking polls will shift the media narrative but not much else.","output":"The article argues that national tracking polls, which show fluctuating leads for Obama and Romney, are overrated and do not predict the actual election outcome. The electoral college, which determines the winner, still projects President Obama to win with over 300 votes, more than the required 270.

Context: I woke at dawn when Digger climbed over me to get out of bed, and I woke again an hour later when Pa called, \\"Everyone up who wants breakfast!\\" Across the room, Little Bit was dressing in a T-shirt and jeans that had been mine a year before. Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on. The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances. Ma called, \\"Little Bit has to use the bathroom.\\" I yelled, \\"I'm almost done.\\" Ma called, \\"Are you off the toilet?\\" I yelled, \\"Yes!\\" Ma opened the door and brought Little Bit in. Squeezing toothpaste onto my toothbrush, I said, \\"I wasn't done yet.\\" Ma said, \\"Your father's making breakfast in the restaurant.\\" That meant we should hurry, so I slid the brush over my teeth while Little Bit sat next to the sink, and then I ran out of the house.

Given the question: Information:  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - I Wayne ( born Cliffroy Taylor , Portmore , Jamaica ) , is a roots reggae singer . He is known for his hit singles \`\` Living In Love '' and \`\` Ca n't Satisfy Her '' from his debut album , Lava Ground .  - Rocksteady is a music genre that originated in Jamaica around 1966. A successor of ska and a precursor to reggae, rocksteady was performed by Jamaican vocal harmony groups such as The Gaylads, The Maytals, The Heptones and The Paragons. The term \\"rocksteady\\" comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the Alton Ellis song \\"Rock Steady\\". Dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dances. The first international rocksteady hit was \\"Hold Me Tight\\" (1968) by the American soul singer Johnny Nash; it reached number one in Canada.  - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region. The western one-third of the island is occupied by the nation of Haiti, making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, that are shared by two countries. The Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean nation by area (after Cuba) at , and 3rd by population with 10.08 million people, of which approximately three million live in the metropolitan area of Santo Domingo, the capital city.  - Rastafari is a religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, following the coronation of Haile Selassie I as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. Its adherents worship him in much the same way as Jesus in his Second Advent, or as God the Son. Members of the Rastafari way of life are known as Rastafari, Rastas, or simply Ras. Rastafari are also known by their official church titles, such as Elder or High Priest. The way of life is sometimes referred to as \\"Rastafarianism\\", but this term is considered offensive by most Rastafari, who, being critical of \\"isms\\" or \\"ians\\" (which they see as a typical part of \\"Babylon\\" culture), dislike being labelled as an \\"ism\\" or \\"ian\\" themselves. Rastafari has always been conceived as a way of life for and by people of African descent.  - Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, consisting of the third-largest island of the Greater Antilles. The island, in area, lies about south of Cuba, and west of Hispaniola (the island containing the nation-states of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Jamaica is the fourth-largest island country in the Caribbean, by area.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Jah or Yah (\\"Yahu\\") is a short form of Yahweh (in consonantal spelling YHWH , called the Tetragrammaton), the proper name of God in the Hebrew Bible.  This short form of the name occurs 50 times in the text of the Hebrew Bible, of which 24 form part of the phrase \\"Hallelujah\\".  - Toots and the Maytals, originally called The Maytals, are a Jamaican musical group and one of the best known ska and rock steady vocal groups. The Maytals were formed in the early 1960s and were key figures in popularizing reggae music. Frontman Toots Hibbert's soulful vocal style has been compared to Otis Redding, and led him to be named one of the 100 Greatest Singers by \\"Rolling Stone\\". Their 1968 single \\"Do the Reggay\\", was the first song to first use the word \\"reggae\\", naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. As Island Records founder Chris Blackwell says, The Maytals were unlike anything else...sensational, raw and dynamic.  - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.  - Allen Toussaint (January 14, 1938  November 10, 2015) was an American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \\"one of popular musics great backroom figures.\\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \\"Java\\", \\"Mother-in-Law\\", \\"I Like It Like That\\", \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Ride Your Pony\\", \\"Get Out of My Life, Woman\\", \\"Working in the Coal Mine\\", \\"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\\", \\"Here Come the Girls\\", \\"Yes We Can Can\\", \\"Play Something Sweet\\", and \\"Southern Nights\\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\\"Mac\\" Rebennack), and \\"Lady Marmalade\\", by Labelle.  - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries.  - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole.  - Lava Ground is the debut album from Jamaican reggae artist I Wayne. The album features guest appearances from Fire Chess, Harmony and Fire Star. As well as production from P. Henry, M.Miller, O. Hibbert etc. The album includes the hits \\"Living In Love\\" and \\"Can't Satisfy Her\\".  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea: Cuba, Hispaniola (containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. The Greater Antilles constitute over 90% of the land mass of the entire West Indies, as well as over 90% of its population, with the balance made of the archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, which is a chain of islands to the east (running north-south and encompassing the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea where it meets the Atlantic Ocean) and south (running east-west off the northern coast of South America).  - I Wayne, Rastafarian stage name for Cliffroy Taylor (born 1980 in Portmore, Jamaica), is a roots reggae singer. He is known for his hit singles \\"Living In Love\\" and \\"Can't Satisfy Her\\" from his debut album, \\"Lava Ground\\".  - \\"Do the Reggay\\" is a reggae song by The Maytals. Written by Toots Hibbert, produced by Leslie Kong and released on Beverly's Records in Jamaica and Pyramid Records in the UK in 1968. \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae\\" and defined the developing genre by giving it its name. At that time, \\"reggay\\" had been the name of a passing dance fashion in Jamaica, but the song's connection of the word with the music itself led to its use for the style of music that developed from it.  - Roots reggae is a subgenre of reggae that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of the artists concerned, including the spiritual side of Rastafari and the honoring of God, called Jah by Rastafari. It also is identified with the life of the ghetto sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include spirituality and religion, poverty, black pride, social issues, resistance to government and racial oppression, and repatriation to Africa.  - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices.  - Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, Jr. (born February 26, 1928) is an American pianist and singer-songwriter of French Creole descent. Five of his records released before 1955 sold over a million copies and were certified as gold records, and he had 35 records in the U.S. Top 40. His musical style is based on traditional rhythm and blues, accompanied by saxophones, bass, piano, electric guitar, and drums.  - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants.  - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.

Having noted the fire's subsidence at lower ground, we assumed the more immediate danger lay higher up the mountain. Reasoning: Understanding the potential risk of the fire helps us determine our best course of action. Step 2: Prepare for evacuation To avoid being caught unprepared, we collected essential emergency supplies, such as water, food, a flashlight, and a first aid kit. These items would be crucial in case we needed to evacuate or aid anyone injured in the fire. Reasoning: Collecting essential supplies is an important precautionary measure in emergencies. Step 3: Gather information To gather more information about the fire, we turned on the radio, hoping to catch any updates from local authorities or news agencies. We sought guidance on evacuations, road closures, and the fire's current status. Simultaneously, we tried contacting nearby neighbors to see if they were aware of the fire and had any additional information to share. Reasoning: Obtaining accurate information would help us gauge the severity of the fire, allowing us to act accordingly. Step 4: Formulate a plan Based on the information received, we mapped out possible escape routes from our location, considering road closures and avoiding areas close to the fire. We also designated a meeting point for our family in case of separation during an evacuation. Reasoning: Having a plan ready ensures that we can effectively respond to the situation in a timely manner and increases our chances of staying safe. Step 5: Monitor the situation We continually monitored the fire's progress, either through observing the smoke, listening to updates on the radio, or maintaining communication with neighbors. This allowed us to stay informed about any changes in the situation, such as the fire's spread or containment efforts, and adjust our plans accordingly. Reasoning: Constantly monitoring the situation ensures that we can react quickly to any changes, increasing our chances of staying safe. Step 6: Act on our plan If the fire approached our location or an evacuation order was issued, we would put our plan into action, grabbing our emergency supplies, following our predetermined escape route, and heading to the designated meeting point. This would help ensure our safety and that of our family members. Reasoning: Acting on a well-thought-out plan, even under pressure, is crucial for effective crisis management. As we continued to watch the smoke rise on the mountain, we stayed vigilant, prepared to react to any updates on the fire or shifts in the situation. Our primary concern was the safety of our family and our community, and we were committed to doing everything within our power to protect them from harm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There are two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. Information in long-term memory can be remembered at a later time when it is needed. The information may be kept for days or weeks. However, information in short-term memory is kept for only a few seconds, usually by repeating the information over and over. The following experiment shows how short-term memory has been studied. Henning studied how students who are learning English as a second language remember vocabulary. The subjects in his experiment were 75 college students. They represented all levels of ability in English: beginning, intermediate  , and native speaking students. To begin, the subjects listened to a recording of a native speaker reading a paragraph in English. Following the recording, the subjects took a 15-question test to see which words they remembered. Each question had four choices. The subjects had to circle the word they had heard in the recording, Some of the questions had four choices that sound alike. For example, weather, whether, wither, and wetter are four words that sound alike. Some of the questions had four choices that have the same meaning. Method, way, manner, and system would be four words with the same meaning. Finally the subjects took a language proficiency test. Henning found that students with a lower proficiency in English made more of their mistakes on words that sound alike; students with a higher proficiency made more of their mistakes on words that have the same meaning. Henning's results suggest that beginning students hold the sound of words in their short-term memory, and advanced students hold the meaning of words in their short-term memory. Question: Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage? - Information in short-term memory is different from that in long-term memory. - Long-term memory can be achieved only by training. - It is easier to test short-term memory than long term memory. - Henning gave a separate test on vocabulary to his students.

If you want GOOD end of the world themed books you should try the Fire-us trilogy. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"This product review conveys a predominantly negative sentiment towards the book in question. The reviewer starts by expressing uncertainty in the title with \\"err.....\\" which suggests that they might have struggled to find a concise or accurate way to describe the book. Moreover, the reviewer mentions that the book is comparable to many others, which implies that it lacks originality or any distinct features that would set it apart from other books in the genre. Furthermore, the reviewer emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the portrayal of the characters' emotions, stating that they \\"just don't speak to me.\\" This highlights a disconnect between the reader and the characters, potentially making it difficult for the reviewer to engage with the story or empathize with the characters' experiences. By characterizing the book as \\"a kind of uniform,\\" the reviewer reinforces the idea that the book is generic and fails to stand out from the crowd. Interestingly, the review includes a recommendation for other books in the same end-of-the-world theme, suggesting the Fire-us trilogy as a more enjoyable alternative. This recommendation not only reinforces the negative sentiment towards the book being reviewed but also serves as a contrasting example of what the reviewer considers to be a \\"GOOD\\" representation of the theme.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To choose a pot for growing plants, Available choices: a. make sure the pot has a hole on the bottom of it.. b. make sure the pot has no holes on the bottom of it..","output":"To determine the better solution for choosing a pot for growing plants, let us examine the pros and cons of both options: Option A: Make sure the pot has a hole on the bottom of it. Pros: 1. Improved drainage: A pot with a hole at the bottom allows excess water to drain from the soil, preventing waterlogging and root rot in the plants. 2. Prevents over-watering: Having a drainage hole helps to prevent over-watering by ensuring that excess water will not remain in the pot, which can harm the plants' roots. 3. Regulates moisture levels: Drainage holes help maintain a balance between moisture and air in the soil, resulting in better overall plant health. 4. Avoids mineral buildup: Holes at the bottom of the pot prevent the accumulation of salts and minerals in the soil, which can cause toxicity or nutrient imbalances for the plants. 5. Provides plants with oxygen: A pot with holes ensures proper oxygen supply to the plant roots, contributing to their growth and vigor. Cons: 1. Potential mess: A pot with drainage holes can create a mess if placed directly on surfaces without a saucer or tray underneath it, as water can spill over and damage the surface. 2. Requires regular watering: A pot with holes may need more frequent watering due to improved drainage, which can cause the soil to dry out more quickly. Option B: Make sure the pot has no holes on the bottom of it. Pros: 1. No mess: Pots without holes create no mess when they are watered, as there will be no leakage or spillage of water onto surfaces. 2. Less frequent watering: With no drainage holes, the soil retains moisture for a longer period, requiring less frequent watering. Cons: 1. Poor drainage and root rot: A pot without holes can cause waterlogging in the soil, which leads to saturated roots that rot and die. 2. Over-watering risk: A pot without holes increases the chances of accidentally over-watering the plants, which can be harmful to their root systems and overall health. 3. Mineral buildup: Without proper drainage, salts and minerals can accumulate in the soil, causing toxicity and nutrient imbalances. 4. Limited oxygen supply: Pots without holes often result in poor oxygen supply to the roots, leading to weak growth. Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of both options, it can be concluded that Option A, a pot with a hole on the bottom, is the better choice for growing plants. It provides improved drainage, prevents over-watering, regulates moisture levels, avoids mineral buildup, and offers better oxygen supply to plant roots. Although it may require more frequent watering and the use of a saucer to prevent mess, the benefits to plant health significantly outweigh these minor inconveniences. On the other hand, Option B, a pot with no holes on the bottom, may have some advantages in terms of maintenance, but it ultimately poses more risks to plant health due to poor drainage, increased chance of over-watering, and limited oxygen supply to the roots."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:For years campaigners have said cancer rates in some villages near factories and polluted waterways have shot up. But the term \\"cancer village\\" has no technical definition and the ministry's report did not elaborate on it. There have been many calls for China to be more transparent on pollution. The latest report from the environment ministry is entitled \\"Guard against and control risks presented by chemicals to the environment during the 12th Five-Year period (2011-2015)\\". It says that the widespread production and consumption of harmful chemicals forbidden in many developed nations are still found in China. \\"The toxic chemicals have caused many environmental emergencies linked to water and air pollution,\\" it said. The report goes on to acknowledge that such chemicals could pose a long-term risk to human health, making a direct link to the so-called \\"cancer villages\\". \\"There are even some serious cases of health and social problems like the emergence of cancer villages in individual regions,\\" it said. The BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing says that as China has experienced rapid development, stories about so-called cancer villages have become more frequent. And China has witnessed growing public anger over air pollution and industrial waste caused by industrial development. Media coverage of conditions in these so-called \\"cancer villages\\" has been widespread. In 2009, one Chinese journalist published a map identifying dozens of apparently affected villages. In 2007 the BBC visited the small hamlet of Shangba in southern China where one scientist was studying the cause and effects of pollution on the village. He found high levels of poisonous heavy metals in the water and believed there was a direct connection between incidences of cancer and mining in the area. Until now, there has been little comment from the government on such allegations. Environmental lawyer Wang Canfa, who runs a pollution aid centre in Beijing, told the AFP news agency that it was the first time the \\"cancer village\\" phrase had appeared in a ministry document. Last month - Beijing - and several other cities - were blanketed in smog that soared past levels considered hazardous by the World Health Organisation. The choking pollution provoked a public outcry and led to a highly charged debate about the costs of the country's rapid economic development, our correspondent says.

Possible answers: (i). yes. (ii). it is not possible to tell. (iii). no.","output":"(i). Yes. Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) weights to compute an estimate of the aggregate US population demand function for postage from the household sector is a valid approach. BLS weights are designed to be representative of the entire US population, which makes them useful in obtaining aggregate household demand functions. The BLS collects extensive data on consumer spending habits and consumer price index (CPI) weights through the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). The CEX captures the spending patterns of a representative sample of US households, making it possible to construct estimates of aggregate demand for various goods and services, including postage.  By combining individual household-level demand functions and applying BLS weights, we can arrive at an estimate of the overall demand function for postage. This aggregate demand function accounts for variations in demographic and socio-economic factors across the US population, leading to a more accurate reflection of the nation's demand for postage. Once we have the aggregate demand function, we can compute own-price and cross-price elasticities of aggregate household demand for postage. The own-price elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in the price of postage, while cross-price elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in the prices of related goods and services, such as electronic communication or courier services. In conclusion, we can confidently say that \\"The demand for postage can be calculated by using BLS weights.\\" This approach allows us to account for the diverse preferences and spending patterns across the US population while obtaining a reliable estimate of the aggregate demand function for postage, which can then be used to analyze own-price and cross-price elasticities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WhatdoesaSchubertliedsoundlike,whenitisplayedoncarillon,guitar,orcrystalglasses? What's a sentence that uses these characters?","output":"To perform the task of describing what a Schubert lied sounds like when played on carillon, guitar, or crystal glasses, and then creating a sentence using those characters, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the elements in the task. - A Schubert lied is a song composed by Franz Schubert, a 19th-century Austrian composer. Schubert lieder are typically known for their expressive melodies and sensitive piano accompaniment, often setting Romantic German poetry to music. - Carillon is a musical instrument consisting of at least 23 bells, typically housed in a bell tower or belfry. Carillons produce a rich, resonant sound that can be heard over great distances. - Guitar is a stringed musical instrument that is usually played by plucking or strumming the strings with fingers, or using a pick. - Crystal glasses are glasses made of highly transparent, colorless glass that have a high-pitched, clear, and ringing sound when rubbed or struck. Step 2: Describe the characteristics of a Schubert lied played on each of these instruments. - Carillon: A Schubert lied played on carillon would have a rich, resonant sound with a deep, bell-like quality. The melody would be more pronounced, and the harmonic structure and intricate piano accompaniments would be less distinct due to the nature of the carillon. - Guitar: A Schubert lied played on guitar would have a warm and intimate sound, with more emphasis on the melody and harmony. The finger-plucked strings would give the music a delicate and expressive quality that could capture the emotional nuances of the original composition. - Crystal glasses: A Schubert lied played on crystal glasses would have a delicate, ethereal, and ringing sound. The melodies would be more prominent while the underlying harmonic structure would be less intricate due to the limitations of the instrument. Step 3: Create a sentence using the characters carillon, guitar, and crystal glasses. \\"Inspired by the deep, resonant tones of the carillon, the warm, expressive melodies of the guitar, and the ethereal ringing of the crystal glasses, the musician sought to create a unique rendition of the Schubert lied that captured the essence of each instrument.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to assemble a tent  Unpack your tent supplies.  Once you've found a good area to set up camp, it's time to unpack your things. It's a good idea to pack all of the parts out at once. Answer:","output":"B. Assembling your tent will be fastest if you don't have to unpack each item one at a time. Keep all parts nestled in one place so you can keep account of everything. Assembling a tent efficiently and effectively requires organization and a plan for ensuring you have everything you need nearby. Unpacking each item one at a time can be tedious and time-consuming. To avoid this and ensure a smooth assembly process, keep all parts of the tent together in one place while you set up. This will help you keep track of everything and will make the assembly process more manageable. To assemble a tent, follow these detailed steps: 1. Choose a level, dry, and preferably elevated area in the site where you want to set up the camp. Avoid areas with rocks, roots, and uneven ground to ensure a comfortable night's sleep. 2. Lay out the tent's footprint or groundsheet. This will act as an additional layer of protection between the tent and the ground. Make sure it's aligned with the direction you want your tent facing. 3. Assemble the tent poles by connecting the individual segments. Most tents will have two main poles that cross each other to create an X-shape. 4. Lay out the tent body on top of the footprint or groundsheet. Make sure the door is aligned with the direction you want to face and that the corners of the tent are aligned with the corners of the footprint. 5. Attach the tent poles to the tent body. This is usually done by inserting the ends of the poles into grommets or sleeves on the corners of the tent. Fasten any clips or hooks along the length of the poles to secure the tent body to the frame. 6. Attach the rainfly to the tent. Drape it over the tent body and poles, making sure it's correctly aligned with the doors and windows. Attach the rainfly to the corner poles or grommets using straps, buckles, or Velcro, depending on your tent's design. 7. Secure the tent to the ground by staking down the corners of the tent and rainfly. Use tent stakes to anchor each corner and any additional guylines. Angle the stakes away from the tent and use a mallet or a rock to drive them into the ground firmly. 8. Tighten any guylines to ensure they are taut and secure. This will provide additional stability to the tent in case of strong winds or rain. 9. Finally, check the tent for any gaps, loose areas, or issues that could affect its performance during your camping trip. Address any issues before proceeding with setting up the rest of your campsite. Setting up the tent efficiently involves having all your materials and tools in one place, so you can assemble without wasting time searching for individual items.

President Donald Trump’s eldest son  Donald Trump Jr.   declined to discuss with lawmakers on Wednesday a conversation  he  had with  his  father about emails related to a June 2016 meeting  he  attended with Trump associates and Russians  a congressional panel member said. Representative Adam Schiff  the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee investigating allegations of Russian interference in last year’s U.S. election  said  Trump Jr.  answered the “overwhelming majority” of questions from committee members in  his  hours of testimony. But  Trump Jr.  claimed attorney-client privilege in declining to respond to queries about that discussion with  his  father because a lawyer was in the room when it took place. The discussion between then-Republican candidate Trump and  his  son took place after the emails became public  Schiff said. Trump Jr. released the emails in July. Representative Mike Conaway  the Republican leading the investigation  said  Trump Jr.  had answered all of  his  questions.  Trump Jr.  arrived and left without being seen by reporters. Lawmakers said they want to question  him  about a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York at which  he  had said  he  hoped to get information about the “fitness  character and qualifications” of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton  the Democrat who was  his  father’s presidential election opponent. It was at least the second time  Trump Jr.  has testified to a congressional committee investigating any Russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with Moscow by the  Trump  campaign.  He  arrived shortly before 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) and was questioned for most of the next eight hours by members of the intelligence panel. A person familiar with knowledge of Trump Jr’s testimony said  Trump  had said repeatedly he did not remember things he was asked about  including some details about information provided by Russians during the Trump Tower meeting. Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating. He has announced the first charges of  Trump  associates  and  Trump’s  former national security adviser  Michael Flynn  has pleaded guilty to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. The House intelligence panel also released on Wednesday a transcript of testimony last week of Erik Prince  a  Trump  supporter and founder of the Blackwater military contractor. A focus of that testimony was a report that Prince tried to set up a “back channel” for communications between  Trump  associates and Russia. Prince denied such a plan. Trump Jr.’s appearance coincided with criticism of the Russia probes from some of his father’s fellow Republicans  who control both houses of Congress and accuse investigators of bias against  Trump . Other lawmakers  Republicans as well as Democrats  say the goal of the investigations is to guarantee the integrity of U.S. elections  not to target  Trump  and  his  associates.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles has long been a destination for artistic dreamers from Europe: Zsa Zsa Gabor moved to Hollywood from Hungary in the 1940s to act. Warsaw-born Roman Polanski moved to Southern California in the 1960s to direct. Not to mention one ambitious actor named Arnold Schwarzenegger, who arguably has done more to boost California's image as a place receptive to Europeans than any tourism initiative the state might have dreamed up the past 30 years. But for accented aspiring pop stars from the EU and beyond, L.A. hasn't generally been considered the place to launch an international music career. That honor fell to cities such as London and New York. Until now. The duo, who are identical twins, moved to","output":"Los Angeles from their native Ireland in 2010 to start their music journey. The twins, known by their stage name, \\"Dublin Vibes,\\" felt the creative allure of L.A.'s diverse music scene and vibrant nightlife. They struggled initially as they faced challenges concerning their unfamiliar accents, lack of funded resources, and fierce competition. Critically, they had outshone their counterparts from the very beginning in passion and determination, evident in their relentless engagement in performing at local venues, creating YouTube covers, and engaging with social media followers. In 2012, Dublin Vibes received their first break when they were spotted by a renowned talent management firm at an open-mic night in downtown L.A. They were signed immediately owing to their unique sound blending contemporary pop music with traditional Irish instrumentation. Nonetheless, major players in the music industry were skeptical. How could an Irish duo, who had never released a radio hit, sell out concerts? Despite the skepticism, Dublin Vibes released their debut album titled \\"Irish Pulse\\" in 2014, which redefined the international music scene. The album, melding their accented lyrical content with a blend of pop, folk, and electronic music, broke boundaries and brought fresh waves to the industry. They found huge success in European and American charts, proving that L.A was indeed a viable launchpad for international music talents. Their success story sparked a new trend, and L.A saw its music scene diversified as more and more foreign artists flocked to seek their American Dream. No longer were London and New York the only cities catered for international pop talents. While Dublin Vibes continued to produce hit singles and sell-out worldwide tours, their impact on LA's music industry extended beyond their personal success. The twins used their influential position to champion diversity in the music industry, frequently collaborating with struggling international artists, and hosting events to raise awareness about cultural representation in music. As for the grand story-telling finale, in 2025, Dublin Vibes was honored with a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' at the Grammy Awards for their ground-breaking contributions to the music scene. Overwhelmed with gratitude, they dedicated their award to their home city of Los Angeles, the city that served as their platform, catalyst, and promised land, allowing them to shift paradigms and redefine international pop music.  In essence, this inspiring tale of Dublin Vibes embodies the possibility of making dreams come true in the face of myriad challenges, leading to the emergence of Los Angeles as a global hub for international music talents. By following their passion, belief, and perseverance, Dublin Vibes not only shine as illustrious stars but also lit up the path for aspiring musicians worldwide. Their journey shows us that music knows no boundaries and that the rhythmic language of harmony and melody can indeed speak louder than words."},{"instruction":"Question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Through your discussion of how they feel, they begin to learn words associated with those feelings and can later use those words to talk out their feelings. This will help them transition to talking about feelings instead of acting out their frustrations. You might say something like “I know you are sad that it is bedtime, but we can play with your toys again tomorrow.” It is important to observe how your children play and act out to understand their feelings. By watching and understanding your toddler’s feelings you can more effectively discuss them. You can also teach your toddler to express their feelings in more socially constructive ways. If your toddler is angry, you might say something like “I know that you are upset that the candy is gone, but you cannot hit people. Instead, you can show us you are upset by taking a deep breath and just telling us you are upset.” Toddlers need to understand what is expected of them. They will naturally push the boundaries, but if you set firm limits and give explanations for those limits, most toddlers will begin to respect the rules. This gives them the structure and boundaries they need to feel secure. Emphasize the positive aspects of rules with your toddler. For example, explain that the your child must get enough sleep tonight so that he or she can have more fun tomorrow. Babies do not interact very well with each other, but once children start to reach the toddler phase, they begin to socialize a bit with other kids. Encourage your toddler to make friends, and teach him or her how to do things like introduce him or herself. This is one of the early milestones in socializing your child. Do not be surprised if your toddler plays more “beside” the other children than they play “with” the other children. Parallel play is common in this stage.","output":"Discussing feelings with your toddler is crucial as it helps them learn words associated with emotions and express themselves better.

Use the arms of the shirt to create straps to hold dress up on shoulders. This option is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because removing the collar and arms will create a cleaner and more continuous mid-section to be used as the skirt portion of the sundress. The unnecessary parts are removed, and the key parts (mid-section and arms) are efficiently utilized for the sundress's construction, maintaining the structural integrity of the dress better in comparison to (A). In option (A), by cutting off the midsection and leaving only the arms, there's potential excess fabric at the shoulder area, which can result in an unusual fit and a less effective design for the dress. Additionally, sewing two midsections together might leave visible seams and a not-so-pleasant aesthetic for the sundress. Therefore, option (B) is better in terms of naive physics reasoning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: Everton are still looking to add two new players to their ranks with Tom Cleverley of Manchester United among the options for Roberto Martinez. The midfielder made his competitive debut for United three years ago and turns 25 on August 12. He has 78 first team games under his belt  but has been targeted as one of the squad's weaker links after failing to kick-on in the last year with any consistency. Everton manager Martinez was widely credited with improving Cleverley while coaching him at Wigan, where he played 25 games in 2010-11, and the Spaniard is keeping a close on developments at Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez: Everton need to sign a few more players. On the move? Everton are interested in Manchester United's much-criticised midfielder Tom Cleverley, with manager Roberto Martinez believing he can reinvigorate the England man. Previous experience: Martinez worked with Cleverley when he was manager of Wigan in 2010-11. Louis van Gaal made Cleverley captain for the friendly against Roma in the USA and will inform players on their return to Manchester this week whether they have made the cut for his planned 22-man squad. The midfielder did not excel against Roma but like many of the United players is enjoying his time under the new Dutch coach. Everton have already splashed out in excess of £35m this summer with Romelu Lukaku, Muhamed Besic and Brendan Galloway signed, while David Henen's transfer from Anderlecht is close. A loan deal for Chelsea's Christian Atsu has hit stalemate but is still on, yet a transfer for Cleverley would cost around £8million. Bradford, Cleverley's first club, would also be due a percentage of any sell on. Decision time: Louis van Gaal will trim his United squad to 22 after their tour of the United States. Statement of intent: Everton have already spent big on striker Romelu Lukaku this summer. VIDEO Van Gaal happy with squad. Martinez may yet prefer to bring in Lacina Traore on loan from Monaco or another striker but Cleverley's situation will be clearer by the end of next week. If they pull off two more deals without selling their stars it would be a huge statement of intent from Everton. The concern at United would be that Martinez could find the key to re-invigorating Cleverley. Van Gaal though will recruit in midfield and defence and has been pleasantly surprised by some of the other younger players' performances. Deals for Arturo Vidal of Juventus and Mats Hummels at Borussia Dortmund remain unlikely. LAMPARD ARRIVAL COULD MEAN CITY SALES. Frank Lampard's arrival at Manchester City has lifted hopes at other clubs that certain fringe players in the Premier League champions' squad will be be made available. Sunderland are among the front runners pushing for a deal with Jack Rodwell while Valencia remain eager to take Bruno Zuculini on loan. Incoming: Frank Lampard's arrival on loan at Manchester City could lead to the departure of other players. Good impression: Bruno Zuculini has looked good on Manchester City's pre-season tour of America. Oriol Romeu has returned from the Spanish League to Chelsea only to be loaned out to the Bundesliga with Stuttgart and Valencia want a defensive-minded midfielder to step in. Zuculini has only just joined from Racing in Argentina but showed on the US tour why City have brought him into their squad. Valencia now hope to give him a season in La Liga where he can continue to improve. However, they face competition for Zuculini from Deportivo La Coruna, who are also among the clubs to have expressed an interest in Liverpool's defensive starlet Tiago Ilori. SOUTHAMPTON CHASING 'MUSKETEER' SCHELOTTO. Southampton will hold further talks with Inter Milan over winger Ezequiel Schelotto on Tuesday. The 25-year-old should certainly give Ronald Koeman's team a better cutting edge as his nickname is 'El Mosquetero' or 'The Musketeer' - although that moniker owes more to his hair than his rapier-swishing style on the wing. It is understood the nickname he actually prefers is 'El Galgo' or 'the Greyhound'. Negotiations: Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is close to sealing the signing of Ezequiel Schelotto. Whatever name he wishes to use, Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio is keen to push a deal forward. They have agreed terms on Dani Osvaldo and are discussing a loan for midfielder Saphir Taider also. Schelotto's agent Bruno Carpeggiani said: 'The situation with Southampton is active and we are waiting for the deal to go ahead.' Although Argentininian born and raised, Schelotto has been capped by Italy. He spent part of last season on loan at Parma. CANAS SWAPPING SWANSEA FOR ELCHE. Swansea midfielder Jose Canas is due to hold talks with Elche ahead of a return to Spain. Celta Vigo, who are playing a series of friendlies in England at the moment, have also shown an interest in the 27-year-old. Swansea manager Garry Monk left Canas out of the club’s pre-season tour to the US, leading his representatives to begin negotiations with Elche sporting director, Victor Orta. Return: Swansea's Jose Canas is holding talks with Elche ahead of a possible return to Spain. Swansea remain on the trail of Almeria's Ramon Azeez and have made enquiries about the Nigerian. Defender Chico Flores remains a target for Michael Laudrup at Lekhwiya. Wolfsburg have expressed an interest in Wilfried Bony, whose wage demands in excess of £100,000-a-week derailed a potential move to Liverpool. Those figures won't be easy for the Bundesliga side to accommodate either although they have also asked about a deal for Chelsea's Fernando Torres who is on around £150,000. Manager Monk said: 'Unless there's a concrete offer that we think is good for us and we want to do business, it doesn't matter. Even then, we're in control - so all of that doesn't matter, because it's speculation - Wilfried's our player.' Demands: Wolfsburg have shown an interest in Wilfried Bony, but his wages could be a stumbling block. NEWCASTLE SIGN FOREST DUO. Newcastle will sign Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow from Nottingham Forest on Monday and loan the pair back. Manager Alan Pardew remains keen to bring in another striker while a deal for Clement Grenier at Lyon remains a possibility. The 23-year-old France midfielder has long been in Newcastle's sights but he is keen to join a Champions League team. If one of those does not come along soon, the greater the Toon's chances become. Possible deal: Newcastle United have been keen on France international Clement Grenier for a while. LIVERPOOL WRAP UP MORENO DEAL. Liverpool's search for a left-back should be concluded soon as talks progress with Sevilla over the £16m transfer of Alberto Moreno. Sevilla have enquired about Sporting Lisbon's 26-year-old Jefferson Nascimento as a potential short term replacement. LAZIO INTERESTED IN KABOUL. Lazio's interest in Younes Kaboul should help Tottenham offset their pending outlay on Eric Dier and Mateo Musacchio from Villarreal. Tottenham have no plans to sell Jan Vertonghen as part of their defensive restructuring but will continue to listen to offers for Michael Dawson. Kaboul, 28, is valued at around £6m by Tottenham although Lazio want to pay around £3m. They are also looking to offload Michael Ciani to Crystal Palace. Tottenham have no interest in Samuel Eto'o, who is looking more likely to return to Italy at this stage with West Ham also looking at younger options. On his way? Lazio are willing to pay Spurs £3m for Younes Kaboul. WEDNESDAY IMPRESSED BY KELHAR. Sheffield Wednesday have offered Slovenian trialist Dejan Kelhar a short-term contract. The 30-year-old defender, who has won six caps for his country and last played for Red Star Belgrade, has been training at Hillsborough and played in some of their pre-season friendlies. Manager Stuart Gray remains keen to sign a striker but Kelhar has also done enough to earn a deal. Gray said: 'We are offering Dejan a short-term contract and hopefully he will be putting pen to paper for us. Nothing has been finalised, he is mulling it over at the moment.' STOKE STOPPER BACHMANN HEADS TO WREXHAM ON LOAN. Stoke's young goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann is poised to join Conference side Wrexham on loan. The 20 year-old Austrian impressed on trial on Friday when appearing for Wrexham in a friendly against a Bolton select XI.

This revelation comes amidst widespread criticism of GTR's performance and ongoing issues related to commuter services.  Paragraph 1: (Explain the context and details of the Commons debate) The House of Commons recently convened to address the pressing concerns regarding Govia Thameslink, with numerous MPs coming forward to voice their criticisms of the company. GTR has been under fire for its management of commuter services and poor punctuality record, leading many to question its fitness for holding the rail franchise. During the debate, issues related to cancellations, overcrowded trains, and frequent delays were highlighted, which have caused significant disruptions to passengers' lives. Paragraph 2: (Rail Minister's statement) Amidst the heated discussion, the Rail Minister confessed that she is \\"often ashamed\\" to serve in her capacity given the current state of the rail network under GTR's management. The damning admission indicates the severity of the concerns surrounding the company's performance and adds weight to the MPs' impassioned pleas for significant improvements to be made. The Rail Minister's words, however, seem to resonate with the general public, who have long been clamoring for a change in how the rail services are managed. Paragraph 3: (Public reaction to the Rail Minister's statement) The Rail Minister's candid admission sparked a mixed response from the general public, with some praising her honesty while others accusing her of merely paying lip service to the issue. It remains to be seen whether this admission will lead to tangible improvements in GTR's management and overall service quality, however, the minister's statement has garnered increased attention toward the ongoing problems with the rail network. Paragraph 4: (Possible outcomes and consequences) The Commons debate, along with the Rail Minister's admission, could potentially lead to serious repercussions for GTR and its management. Government officials and regulatory bodies may be pressured to take decisive action and review the current railway franchising arrangements, potentially resulting in a major overhaul of the management and operation of services. The situation unfolding around GTR serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of functional public transportation systems for the well-being and prosperity of the nation. Conclusion: As the Commons debate on Govia Thameslink continues to unfold, the Rail Minister's admission of being \\"often ashamed\\" to hold her title has generated significant public interest and sparked discussions about the need for improving the rail network. While it remains to be seen if tangible change will occur, the ongoing scrutiny of GTR serves as an important indication that the status quo is no longer acceptable and demands for a better-public transportation system must be prioritized."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The New York Times The Wolfpak’s loosely affiliated membership comes mostly from the neighboring island of Kauai. It includes professional surfers like the three-time world champion Andy Irons, 30, and his brother, Bruce, 29, a talented free surfer. The most notorious member is the group’s enforcer, Kala Alexander, a professional surfer with muscular tattooed arms and “Wolfpak” inked across his knuckles. In 2007, Alexander starred in “The 808,” a reality television series about the Wolfpak and the North Shore, and appeared in the films “Blue Crush” and “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” But he has also gained fame for YouTube videos that show him pummeling surfers on the sand several years ago. “The code is to respect other people,” Alexander, 39, said. “People come over here and don’t respect other people. You’re going to run into problems if you do that.” That is what happened to Chris Ward, a 30-year-old professional from San Clemente, Calif., and runner-up to Kelly Slater last month at the Pipeline Masters. In November, Australian publications reported that Ward cut off a local surfer while riding a wave at Pipeline. He was banished to the beach, where a Wolfpak member smacked him in the head. Without providing details, Ward confirmed that the incident happened. “It’s been like that for four decades,” said Peter Townend, who in 1976 won the first world championship of surfing on the North Shore. In 1978, he said, he was punched out at a surf break called Off the Wall. In that year he required a police escort to compete in the Pipeline Masters because of threats against him. During the 2007 Pipeline Masters, a fracas in the water spilled onto the beach as Sunny Garcia of Hawaii chased his opening-round opponent, Neco Padaratz of Brazil. Padaratz fled, followed by Garcia and some locals. The police eventually escorted Padaratz from the contest site. Such incidents create debate about localism, a brand of territorialism that has been practiced at surf breaks around the world for decades. Yet the North Shore remains a focal point because its breaks are a proving ground for professional aspirants who arrive each winter along with the massive swells out of the North Pacific. “It’s really the center of the surfing universe,” Tomson said. “It’s like Mount Everest for surfers everywhere. And Pipeline is really the wave one needs to come to terms with as a surfer in order to be considered a great surfer.” As surfing has become increasingly popular, some say fear of violent reprisal ensures order and safety at congested and perilous surf spots like Pipeline. “It’s a dangerous environment, and without a self-governing control pattern it would just be chaos out there,” Rarick said. At Pipeline, large, punishing waves break over a shallow-water reef. With a small takeoff zone comes a small window of time to make critical decisions and dozens of surfers vying for the same waves. Pipeline is considered one of the world’s most dangerous surf spots. No official figures exist on fatalities. But a 2008 book, “The Pipeline: Deep Inside the World’s Most Respected Wave,” asserted that more than 30 people had died there since it was first surfed in 1961. “It’s a very intense crowd,” said Slater, 36, of Cocoa Beach, Fla. “It’s as intense as anywhere in the world because there are serious consequences if you drop in on somebody and they got hurt, or if you wipe out and hurt yourself.” The Wolfpak formed a decade ago when Alexander moved to the North Shore and joined his childhood friend Kai Garcia, a former professional surfer and jujitsu champion known as Kaiborg for his fearsome superhuman reputation. Alexander had recently been released from prison after serving time for assault. “It was crowded when I came here,” Alexander said about Pipeline. “A lot of people in the water, not much respect. Where I grew up on Kauai, you respect everybody in the water, especially your elders. Don’t step out of line. We just brought that mentality over here.” At the time there was a void in the Pipeline lineup as those who regulated the waves during the 1990s, like Derek Ho, Johnny Boy Gomes and Marvin Foster, had grown older and moved on. And there was a template for a group like the Wolfpak. With outsiders and the burgeoning professional contest circuit shunting them from their favorite surf spots, some Hawaiian surfers banded together in 1976 to form the Hui O He’e Nalu, or Club of Wave Sliders. “That was one of the reasons the Hui O He’e Nalu was formed, to regulate the surf breaks,” said Bryan Amona, a founding member. “Not to be walked all over.” In 1975, a brash group of surfers from South Africa and Australia swept the North Shore contests and monopolized news media coverage. The Australians even boasted of their superiority to their Hawaiian counterparts. Some Hawaiians, feeling disrespected at home in a sport their ancestors invented, threatened and thrashed the outsiders when they returned the next winter. “For the Hawaiians, respect is an important concept, particularly when it comes to being in the ocean,” said Isaiah Helekunihi Walker, a professor of history at Brigham Young University, Hawaii, who has written about a Hawaiian renaissance in surfing on the North Shore. Members of Hui O He’e Nalu, known as Da Hui or the Black Shorts, for their uniform surf trunks, paddled into waves during competitions to protest that the water had been closed to them. Eddie Rothman, another Da Hui founder, who with other members has parlayed the club’s name and logo into a surf apparel brand, said violence against the outsiders was not coordinated. “When they came here, there was no cultural resistance,” he said. “They were separate incidents.” For some, “Bustin’ Down the Door” has stirred up the old animus. Walker said: “I think this tradition, even though the Hui started it in the ’70s, Hawaiian surfers are still very much at the forefront of this whole kind of consciousness, of seeing themselves as the chiefs in the water maintaining order.” Da Hui’s membership has mellowed with age, and the group’s agenda has shifted from activism to community events. The Wolfpak has likewise made a bid for increasing respectability with an annual beach cleanup. In December, Alexander visited children in a Honolulu hospital and gave surfing lessons to youngsters with cystic fibrosis. But not everyone is ready to accept the group’s softer side. In November, an Outside magazine article in which Alexander offered a mea culpa for past misdeeds and expressed hope that peace would prevail at the Pipeline prompted readers to denounce the surfers’ tactics. Last month, when a reporter asked Alexander about the online video showing him punching surfers, he became enraged. Several longtime residents said incidents of violence had diminished. “Reported surf-related assaults are very rare, according to the commander” responsible for the North Shore, said Michelle Yu, a spokeswoman for the Honolulu Police Department. Strider Wasilewski, the surf team manager for Quiksilver Americas, who has spent parts of 24 winters on the North Shore, said: “Guys aren’t going crazy beating people in public. It’s just a lot nicer now.” “You can’t get away with the things you used to get away with” because of the threat of lawsuits, he added. But those who come for waves can still catch a beating, too. “It’s not as raw,” Rarick said. “It’s not as radical. But the essence of it is still there.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"This text talks about a group of surfers called the Wolfpak who live in Hawaii. They are known for protecting their favorite surf spots from disrespectful visitors and sometimes use violence to do so. The Wolfpak members come mostly from the nearby island of Kauai and include professional surfers like Andy Irons and his brother, Bruce. The North Shore in Hawaii is known for its world-famous waves, especially Pipeline, which is considered one of the most dangerous surf spots. Because of this, surfers from all over the world come to the North Shore, causing lots of competition for waves and sometimes a lack of respect for local surfers. The Wolfpak formed to bring order to the crowded waters and make sure everyone follows the code of respect. There have been incidents in the past where surfers who did not follow the code were physically attacked by the Wolfpak members. Despite their history of using violence, the group has been trying to improve their image by participating in community events, such as beach cleanups and visiting sick children in the hospital. Many people still criticize the Wolfpak's tactics and the use of violence to enforce respect, but some say that the situation in the surfing community has improved over time, and incidences of violence have decreased."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She plans to quit teaching and marry her wealthy fiancé Mark, but resumes her job when he dumps her after learning she is only after his money. Elizabeth tries to win over substitute teacher Scott Delacorte, who is also wealthy because his family runs a watch company. Amy Squirrel, a dedicated and enthusiastic colleague, also pursues Scott while the school's gym teacher, Russell Gettis, makes it clear that he is interested in Elizabeth romantically, and she is not interested in him because he is a gym teacher. Elizabeth plans to get surgery to enlarge her breasts and becomes all the more motivated to do so once she learns Scott's ex-girlfriend had large breasts, but she cannot afford 9,300 for the procedure. She feels worse when Scott admits that he is interested in Amy, and that he only likes Elizabeth as a friend. Elizabeth attempts to raise money for the surgery by participating in her 7th grade class car wash in provocative clothing and by manipulating parents to give her money for more school supplies and tutoring, but her efforts are not enough. Amy, acting on the growing resentment between them due to Elizabeth pursuing Scott and ignoring school rules, attempts to warn the principal about Elizabeth's embezzlement scheme, but he dismisses her claims as groundless., what would be the answer ?","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, the first name of the person who cannot afford the surgical procedure is Elizabeth. Elizabeth Halsey is the one who plans to get surgery to enlarge her breasts but cannot afford the 9,300 for the procedure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. **Spoilers contained** I'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific. What I didn't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go. What starts off as a typical cowboy/indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy' about Honus (Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne. The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit. Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason. They then escape and both turn up (separately) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base. As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them. So far so ordinary. Then comes the ending. After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they/won't they get together storyline, the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head. Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn't resort to extreme gratuitous violence. In some ways, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending. I didn't hate Soldier Blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents, I would recommend Elem Klimov's Come and See. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought negatively of the movie.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Justin is conducting a chemical experiment involving sodium hydroxide. A key part of the reaction is ensuring that the sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water before adding the other materials. Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction A, and sets the heat to high. Justin can't use high heat for his second reaction, though, because the electricity supply is too weak to have both burners on high. Because of this, Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction B and sets the heat to low.  But I can use this background: When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs  What is an answer for this question: In which reaction will the sodium hydroxide dissolve faster? Answer:","output":"The sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A. There are several factors that contribute to this outcome, as specified in the background information provided. In this case, the key determinant is the temperature at which the reactions are conducted. When Justin conducts reaction A, he sets the heat to high. By increasing the temperature, the molecules in the water gain more kinetic energy, which leads to more frequent and vigorous collisions between the sodium hydroxide and water molecules. As a result, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve more rapidly in reaction A. On the other hand, in reaction B, Justin is forced to set the heat to low due to limitations in the electricity supply. This lower temperature results in less kinetic energy for the water molecules, and therefore fewer and less vigorous collisions between sodium hydroxide and water molecules. Consequently, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve at a slower rate in reaction B compared to reaction A. The interplay between temperature and dissolution can be observed in everyday life, such as in the provided example of sugar dissolving in hot tea versus iced tea. In most cases, a solute (in this circumstance, sodium hydroxide) will dissolve at a quicker rate when the temperature of the solvent (water) is increased. In conclusion, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A due to the higher heat setting and consequently elevated water temperature, which facilitates more rapid dissolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dennis Wayne Johnson (September 18, 1954 - February 22, 2007), nicknamed \\"DJ\\", was an American professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association's (NBA) Seattle SuperSonics, Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics and coach of the Los Angeles Clippers. He was an alumnus of Dominguez High School, Los Angeles Harbor College and Pepperdine University. A prototypical late bloomer, Johnson overcame early struggles and had a successful NBA playing career. Drafted 29th overall in 1976 by the Seattle SuperSonics Dennis Wayne Johnson was born the eighth of sixteen children, to a social worker and a bricklayer who lived in Compton, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. Originally a baseball fan and a Little Leaguer, Johnson learned basketball from his father, but seemed to have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers: as a teenager at Dominguez High School, Johnson measured just 5'9\\" and played only \\"a minute or two each game\\". After high school, he worked several odd jobs, including a 2.75-per-hour job as a forklift driver, and played with his brothers in summer league games after work. During this period, Johnson grew to a height of 6'3\\", and developed what some later described as \\"rocket launcher legs\\", which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents.  Jim White, the coach at Los Angeles Harbor College, had watched Johnson play street basketball; feeling that Johnson excelled in defense, White asked him to enroll. Johnson gave up his jobs and developed into a promising young guard, averaging 18.3 points and 12.0 rebounds per game and leading Harbor to a college junior state title. However, the young guard lacked discipline, often clashed with White and was thrown off the team three times in two years.  At the end of his junior college career, two universities offered Johnson scholarships: Azusa Pacific University and Pepperdine University. Johnson chose the latter, and in his only year there, he averaged 15.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game, and developed a reputation for tough defense. After that year, Johnson made himself eligible for the 1976 NBA draft, but was skeptical that any team would take him. NBA teams were wary of drafting a player with character issues, and Johnson was known to be a troublemaker.

With block style, every part of the letter will be aligned with the left margin. Indented style requires that you indent the beginning of every paragraph, as well as the sender’s address, complimentary close, and the signature. The differences in these are largely a matter of preference; however, block style is more commonly used in business letters today. This can be either your home or business address, depending on whether the letter is sent on behalf of you personally or on behalf of your company. You should include your street address, city, state, and zip code, but you should not include your name.  If you are writing your letter in block format, your address should be lined up with the left margin. If you are using indented format, start one tab right of the center margin.  Phone numbers and email addresses are generally not included in the sender’s address, but they are acceptable. This should be the date that the letter was written. There should be a space between your address and the date, and 2 spaces between the date and the recipient’s address. Two spaces below the date, type the recipient’s name, including their courtesy title, such as Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Dr. Use the same courtesy title used in the salutation. Beneath the recipient’s name, include the full name of their company, if you are writing a business letter. For personal formal letters, you can omit the business name. Follow with the full address. As with the sender’s address, this should include the street address, city, state, and zip code. If your letter is addressed to a company or a specific department, you can include an attention line to direct the letter to a specific individual. This would come 2 spaces below the address and 2 spaces above the salutation. The salutation would be directed to the company or the department. The salutation is a greeting, and is likely the first thing your recipient will read. The salutation should be aligned with the left margin. Examples of salutations might include \\"Dear Mrs. Wells:\\" or \\"Dear Professor:\\" If you used the block format, your body, complimentary closing, and signature will all be aligned with the left margin. If you used indented format, the body will be left aligned with each paragraph indented, and the closing will be one tab left of the center, in line with the sender’s address. The complimentary close should be a phrase such as “Best regards” or “Thank you” and should be followed by a comma. Only the first word is capitalized. Skip 4 lines, which is the space for your signature, then end with your name. Summary:","output":"Formal letters have two styles: block style and indented style.

Answer: It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history, subsequently paving the way for various political changes, such as revolutions in many of the nations involved. Question: who staRTED WORLD WAR I? Answer:","output":"To answer the question \\"Who started World War I?\\", I will follow these steps: 1. Recall the main factors and events that led to the outbreak of World War I. 2. Identify the key players involved in the conflict's beginning. 3. Formulate an answer based on the gathered information. Step 1: Recalling the main factors and events that led to World War I World War I was a result of a complex web of factors, including nationalism, imperial ambitions, and militarism, among the European powers. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Serbian nationalist group Black Hand, in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, is considered the immediate trigger for the war. Step 2: Identifying the key players involved in the conflict's beginning While the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the immediate spark, multiple nations and alliances contributed to the tensions that eventually led to the war. The major players involved in the conflict included the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) and the Allied Powers (the United Kingdom, France, and Russia).  Step 3: Formulating an answer based on the gathered information Based on the information gathered, it is not correct to attribute the start of World War I to a single nation or individual. It was the culmination of various factors, events, and the actions of multiple nations.

Write an article based on this summary: – As part of his recent bid to appeal to women, Mitt Romney deployed what he called an \\"amazing statistic,\\" saying that \\"92.3% of all the jobs lost during the Obama years have been lost by women.\\" If that made your eyebrows climb your forehead, you're not alone. The AP's fact checkers looked into the statement, and found that while it's technically true, it's also truly misleading. The recession began 13 months before Obama took office, and it initially hit men disproportionately hard. Male-dominated industries like construction and manufacturing are often hit first in recessions, and that was especially true this time. When Obama took office, women-dominated industries were catching up, and the number of unemployed women grew by 858,000 after January 2009—the basis of Romney's stat. But overall, men have lost 3.4 million jobs during the recession, to 1.8 million for women—which is why some economists have dubbed it the \\"man-cession.\\" CNN also notes that women began losing jobs in March 2008, well before Obama's inauguration. Article:","output":"Title: The Reality Behind Romney's \\"Amazing Statistic\\" on Women's Job Losses During the Obama Years Mitt Romney, in a recent effort to appeal to women, stated that \\"92.3% of all the jobs lost during the Obama years have been lost by women.\\" This claim, which he dubbed an \\"amazing statistic,\\" has raised many eyebrows and triggered an investigation by AP's fact-checkers. Upon closer examination, it has been revealed that while this statistic is technically true, it is also highly misleading. The recession, which initially hit male-dominated industries like construction and manufacturing the hardest, began 13 months before President Obama took office. These sectors are usually the first to suffer during recessions, and this pattern held during the 2008 financial crisis. When Obama assumed the presidency, female-dominated industries were just beginning to feel the effects of the economic downturn, leading to an increase in the number of unemployed women. The basis for Romney's statement is that the number of unemployed women did, in fact, grow by 858,000 after January 2009. However, this number alone fails to provide a complete and accurate picture of the recession's impact on employment. When examining the overall toll of the recession on job losses, men have lost 3.4 million jobs compared to 1.8 million for women. This gender disparity in job loss is why some economists have referred to the 2008 recession as the \\"man-cession.\\" Furthermore, CNN has noted that women actually started losing jobs in March 2008, several months before Obama's inauguration, further discrediting the correlation between the Obama administration and the majority of women's job losses. In conclusion, while Mitt Romney's \\"amazing statistic\\" may be technically true, it is crucial for the public to understand that it is also highly misleading. The recession's impact on job loss must be examined holistically and in the context of the economic climate that the administration inherited. The reality is that both men and women have faced significant challenges in the job market during and following the 2008 recession, and pointing to a single statistic without acknowledging the broader context simply does not provide an accurate representation of the situation."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks. In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method.  Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001.

Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level.  But I can use this background: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation.  Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.  What is an answer for this question: Which cousin experienced more temperature inversion phenomena? The answer is:","output":"Ann, who lived in the mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, experienced more temperature inversion phenomena.

A team of scientists from Ohio State University did experiments on 33 volunteers who were getting better from heart disease following operation. They found that people who exercised while listening to Italian musician Antonio Vivaldi's \\"The Four Seasons\\" did much better on language ability tests than without music. \\"Facts suggest that exercise improves the learning ability of people with heart disease,\\" said the psychologist Charles Emery, who led the study. \\"And listening to music is thought to _ understanding. We just wanted to put the two results together,\\" he added. The volunteers said they felt better emotionally and physically after working out with or without the music. But their improvement on the test doubled after listening to music during exercise. Scientists have proved that music can be good for health, education and well-being. It helps reduce stress, sadness and nervousness; encourages relaxation or sleep; wakes up the body and improves memory and thoughts. In medical fields, music is used widely for patients who have had head hurts before and after operation. \\"The Four Seasons\\" was used because of its moderate tempo and positive results in earlier research. \\"Exercise seems to cause positive changes in the nervous system  and these changes may have a direct result on learning ability,\\" Emery said. Scientists have been studying the results of music on understanding since the early 1950s. By 2000, psychologists were using Mozart's music, especially his violin pieces, to help children with speech disorders. Mozart was chosen because his music is not overexciting and has clear structures. A study showed students who listened to Mozart went on to score higher marks in an intelligence test. With important exams drawing near, your parents will not probably allow you to listen to music. But perhaps now you have good reasons to argue with them.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who pleaded for help from the Mongol prince? , can you please find it?   When an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Gelugpas again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan (1582–1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the Oirat Mongols, who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa. Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters. In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered. Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \\"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,\\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies.

Royal assent In the United Kingdom, a bill is presented for royal assent after it has passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons may, under certain circumstances, direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the House of Lords. Officially, assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent.

Q: Which Parliamentary Acts allow a bill to be presented for assent even after the House of Lords has refused it?","output":"The Parliamentary Acts that allow a bill to be presented for assent even after the House of Lords has refused it are the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a new situation: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.  But I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  What is an answer for this question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan? The answer to this question is:","output":"Under Milly's plan, the number of animals is more likely to increase or at least stabilize compared to the current situation. Milly's approach focuses on reducing the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which is a crucial factor in mitigating the negative impacts of climate change and global warming. As mentioned in the background information, climate change and global warming, caused by human-made releases of greenhouse gases, are having adverse effects on the planet, its natural environment, and human existence. One significant consequence of this warming is the destruction of natural habitats, which leads to a reduction in wildlife population. By decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Milly's plan would help slow down the rate of global warming, subsequently protecting and preserving natural habitats for animals. Ensuring the survival of these habitats is essential for maintaining and potentially increasing the population of wildlife species. This approach aligns with Mike's values, as it focuses on both saving the planet and preserving the animals that inhabit it. In summary, under Milly's plan, the number of animals is more likely to increase or stabilize due to her emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which would help address the critical issue of climate change and its detrimental effects on wildlife populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"and it fails and you're dead\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"You die because it fails.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"and it fails and you're dead,\\" the hypothesis \\"You die because it fails\\" appears to be true. However, to fully evaluate the validity of the hypothesis, we must delve into the relationship between the failure of \\"it\\" and the subsequent death of the individual in question and examine if there is a causal relationship between the two events. The premise itself establishes that two events occur in succession - the failure and the resulting death. To be more specific, \\"it fails\\" should be the cause and \\"you're dead\\" should be the effect. In this context, the hypothesis \\"You die because it fails\\" is asserting the following causal relationship: 1. If \\"it\\" fails, then you die. 2. \\"It\\" does indeed fail. 3. Therefore, you die. By presenting these points, the hypothesis affirms the causal relationship between the two events. However, it's crucial to consider other factors that might affect the validity of the hypothesis in different contexts or scenarios. For instance, consider the context that \\"it\\" refers to a medical treatment or procedure. In this case, the hypothesis might be valid if the failure of the treatment or procedure directly leads to the person's death. However, if the person would have died regardless of whether the treatment or procedure was successful or not, the causal relationship might not hold, and the hypothesis could be false. Additionally, the hypothesis could be deemed true in a more general sense, without directly implying a cause-and-effect relationship. In other words, the premise could be interpreted as stating that when \\"it\\" fails (whatever \\"it\\" is), death follows, but this might not mean that \\"it\\" failing is the immediate or direct cause. It could be that a series of other events or factors lead to the individual's death, though the failure of \\"it\\" is simply associated with those events or factors. In such a situation, we can still assert that the hypothesis is true, albeit with more nuance. Ultimately, based on the given premise, \\"and it fails and you're dead,\\" the hypothesis \\"You die because it fails\\" generally appears to be true, bearing in mind the assumption of a causal relationship between the two events. This conclusion is supported by the premise's sequential presentation of the events and the understanding that the failure in question is presumably a determinant factor in the person's death. Nonetheless, the validity of the hypothesis may fluctuate depending on the contextual interpretation and the exploration of other contributing factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Highlights of the project include experiments in the carving, transport and erection of the notable moai, as well as excavations at such prominent sites as Orongo and Poike. The expedition published two large volumes of scientific reports (Reports of the Norwegian Archaeological Expedition to Easter Island and the East Pacific) and Heyerdahl later added a third (The Art of Easter Island). Heyerdahl's popular book on the subject, Aku-Aku was another international best-seller.  In Easter Island: The Mystery Solved (Random House, 1989), Heyerdahl offered a more detailed theory of the island's history. Based on native testimony and archaeological research, he claimed the island was originally colonized by Hanau eepe (\\"Long Ears\\"), from South America, and that Polynesian Hanau momoko (\\"Short Ears\\") arrived only in the mid-16th century; they may have come independently or perhaps were imported as workers. According to Heyerdahl, something happened between Admiral Roggeveen's discovery of the island in 1722 and James Cook's visit in 1774; while Roggeveen encountered white, Indian, and Polynesian people living in relative harmony and prosperity, Cook encountered a much smaller population consisting mainly of Polynesians and living in privation.  Heyerdahl notes the oral tradition of an uprising of \\"Short Ears\\" against the ruling \\"Long Ears\\". The \\"Long Ears\\" dug a defensive moat on the eastern end of the island and filled it with kindling. During the uprising, Heyerdahl claimed, the \\"Long Ears\\" ignited their moat and retreated behind it, but the \\"Short Ears\\" found a way around it, came up from behind, and pushed all but two of the \\"Long Ears\\" into the fire. This moat was found by the Norwegian expedition and it was partly cut down into the rock. Layers of fire were revealed but no fragments of bodies.  As for the origin of the people of Easter Island, DNA tests have shown a connection to South America, critics conjecture that this was a result of recent events, but whether this is inherited from a person coming in later times is hard to know. If the story that (almost) all Long Ears were killed in a civil war is true, as the islanders story goes, it would be expected that the statue-building South American bloodline would have been nearly utterly destroyed, leaving for the most part the invading Polynesian bloodline. Answer this question \\"What else did he produce\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Thor Heyerdahl produced several publications and reports based on his expedition to Rapa Nui (Easter Island).

Sentence: The United States Air Force currently has 465 troop carrier groups.","output":"After analyzing the given text and researching the current state of United States Air Force, it is clear that the sentence stating \\"The United States Air Force currently has 465 troop carrier groups\\" is not true. The text provides information about the 464th Troop Carrier Group, specifying that it was operational during the Cold War era under the Tactical Air Command between 1953 and 1957, utilizing Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar and Fairchild C-123 Provider aircraft. However, the text does not mention the current state or number of troop carrier groups in the United States Air Force. In reality, the organizational structure of the United States Air Force since the Cold War has gone through significant changes. The Air Force has consolidated, inactivated, and reorganized several units, transitioning from the concept of Troop Carrier Groups to different titles and responsibilities, such as Airlift or Air Mobility Wings and Squadrons, which focus on delivering personnel, cargo, and other essential support in various operations. A precise number of troop carrier groups or airlift squadrons might vary based on the ongoing organizational structure, modernization, or changes in the strategic context of the United States Air Force. However, it is highly unlikely that there are currently 465 troop carrier groups in the United States Air Force. In conclusion, based on the information provided and the current structure of the United States Air Force, the sentence claiming that there are currently 465 troop carrier groups is incorrect as the organization has evolved since the Cold War, and the concept of troop carrier groups is no longer in use as it once was."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Manchester City demolished by Bayern Munich rulers of the middle ground Bayern Munich's influential midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger powers in a free-kick during the Champions League game against Manchester City at the Etihad. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian Well, there's something you don't see every day. If there were some chastening lessons for Manchester City in the course of one of the more overwhelming 3-1 home defeats you are likely to see, there is perhaps some consolation in both the extent and the nature of Bayern's superiority in a decisive opening hour. Frankly there were lessons here for everyone as Bayern produced an alluringly controlled exhibition of football from the near-future, tactically and technically beyond the reach of City's Champions League work-in-progress, despite a spirited late rally. It was a pointed kind of superiority too. There were those who questioned what Pep Guardiola could do to refine this team, but the answer was here in flashes. Bayern's midfield, headed by Thomas Müller in a roving lone striker role, was irresistible at times. This was Bayern, but a little more so, Bayern with added swarm. If the success under Jupp Heynckes was based around the imposing rhythms of that thrummingly high-spec midfield, this was never likely to be diluted under Guardiola, who in his wonder years at Barcelona finessed the idea that football is now a sport of midfielders, the best teams comprised almost entirely of a collection of strolling mini-generals. This is the thing about this Bayern team: they do not just want to score more goals than you, they want to out-run and out-pass you through the centre of the pitch. The opposition are not simply beaten: they are Bayerned – and City were at times entirely Bayerned as for long periods the German champions played a de facto eight-man midfield, with both full-backs imperiously pushed on and the revolving bank of red shirts pushed right up on to City's defence. It is a relentless style City themselves have employed successfully at times, most recently in this stadium against Manchester United. With that memory still fresh the contrast was stark here as Bayern's midfield did to City's midfield what City's midfield had done to United's, depriving them of the ball, moving into space with a fearsomely well-grooved sense of purpose, and generally out-muscling a midfield that had looked pretty much un-musclable against the English champions two weeks ago. This was City's fate in the first half, with Yaya Touré in particular bypassed. Touré remains a coveted presence in the Premier League, a great clanking Iron Man of a midfielder, whether employed in his galloping forward-destroyer mode or as a box-to-box all-rounder. Here was an opportunity for the Premier League's own Gulliver to stand up to the Bayern machine, and perhaps to prey on a slightly less tigerish midfield deprived of Javi Martinez. Fat chance. It was startling to see the Ivorian so obviously uncomfortable, lurching sideways in search of the ball, repeatedly harried in possession and outmanoeuvred by Philipp Lahm, who was again exceptional in his converted central role. Plus, of course, there was a Guardiola-flavoured surprise further forward as Müller – attacking midfielder, scruffy-haired wanderer and self-coined \\"Space Investigator\\" – played as a central striker. Albeit, as ever with Müller this was a quirkily nuanced version, some way short of the flailing medieval target-man more familiar on these shores, and not quite a false nine either. At first Müller dropped deep, wandering on to the flanks and at times simply mooching around in an offside position, skinny-legged and awkward, like a jogger accidentally strayed on to the pitch. Later, though, he produced some moments of classy orthodox centre-forward play, emerging as the outstanding player on the pitch and, as ever, a standard bearer for brain over brawn at the highest level. It was one of Müller's sudden bursts of activity that helped to create the space that led to Bayern's first goal. With Gaël Clichy drawn inside by Müller's spin, Rafinha had time to find Franck Ribéry with a crossfield pass. His shot was well struck but Hart should have saved it. Bayern don't need a goal's start, but here they were presented with a floppy-wristed goalkeeping welcome basket. City drew breath amid a familiar sense of red-shirted suffocation, accompanied, as if to rub it in, by repeated chidings from Guardiola on the sidelines, Bayern's manager demanding an ever higher passing tempo, a more palpable sense of supremacy. To their credit City resisted, gaining something of a foothold in the match either side of half time and pulling a goal back near the end though Alvaro Negredo. It was Müller who killed the game on 56 minutes with a horribly simple goal. On this occasion it was the space between Clichy's ears that the Raumdeuter chose to investigate, making a diagonal run past City's left-back, who simply watched him go, and nudging the simplest of long passes past Hart and into the net. For City there was no disgrace in losing to a Bayern team who may or may not retain their European crown, but who looked at the Etihad like champions whose strengths have, if anything, been sharpened and refined. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses a football match between Manchester City and Bayern Munich in the Champions League, where Bayern Munich won 3-1. The article highlights the significant tactical and technical superiority of Bayern Munich in the match, particularly in the midfield, led by Thomas Müller. It credits manager Pep Guardiola for refining and improving an already accomplished Bayern team and specifically points out the uncomfortable game experienced by Manchester City's Yaya Touré, who was outplayed by Philipp Lahm among others from the opposition's midfield line. The article concludes that Bayern Munich displayed a strengthened and refined champion's performance at the Etihad Stadium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Lieutenant Ord started the regulars forward on the American left and Roosevelt claimed he started the charge on the right. Retreating Spanish troops withdrew toward San Juan Hill still being contested. The regulars fired toward them and supported their comrades fighting on the adjacent hill.

Here's a breakdown and analysis of the negative aspects identified in the sentence: 1. \\"rymer does n't trust laughs\\": The mention of Rymer not trusting laughs could suggest a lack of faith in the comedic moments of the work, which has a negative connotation. It indicates that the creator may not have effectively incorporated humor into the project.  2. \\"does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre\\": This part of the sentence highlights that the creator failed to show respect or acknowledge the specific tastes and preferences of the target audience – followers of the dead-undead genre. The usage of \\"proper respect\\" indicates that the creator did not meet the expected standard or treatment for this category of followers. 3. \\"who deserve more from a vampire pic\\": The statement further emphasizes the disappointment of the target audience. It expresses a sense of injustice to the followers of the genre, implying that they have certain standards and expectations for vampire-themed works which the creator did not meet. The usage of \\"deserve more\\" conveys the feeling that the viewers' preferences have not been adequately taken into consideration. 4. \\"than a few shrieky special effects\\": This negative sentiment relates to the quality of the special effects within the work. \\"Shrieky\\" special effects can be associated with cheap, low-quality, or unsophisticated visuals or audio elements. The statement emphasizes that the followers of the genre expect more depth and substance than just some poorly-executed effects. In conclusion, the sentiment of the provided sentence is predominantly negative. It criticizes the creator (Rymer) for not trusting laughs, lacking proper respect for the followers of the genre, not catering to the expectations of the target audience, and relying on poorly-done special effects.

This is essential in understanding the structure of the tweet but doesn't convey any sentiment on its own, so we can characterize this as neutral as well. 3. \\"hopefully\\": The use of \\"hopefully\\" implies that the next part of the tweet is something that the user is looking forward to or wishes to happen. This word adds a sense of optimism, anticipation, or positivity to the sentiment. It shows that the user is positively inclined towards the upcoming event or scenario, which contributes to a positive sentiment. 4. \\"a nap\\": This phrase is the subject of the user's hope. Naps are typically considered as restful and rejuvenating experiences, and since the user is looking forward to taking a nap, this part of the tweet has a positive sentiment as well. Napping usually indicates a break or a moment of self-care, which is seen as a positive act for personal wellbeing. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet is a mix of neutral, positive, and anticipatory emotions. The neutral sentiment comes from the task or process-related portion of the tweet, while the positive sentiment arises from the user's hope for a nap. The anticipatory emotion, which is an important part of the overall sentiment, is derived from the user's use of the word \\"hopefully\\" and their expectation of enjoying a restful nap."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dear Carolyn: What if the person you need to forgive is yourself? I bullied my younger sister as a kid/teen, and as a grown 30-something I feel incredible shame and guilt. I have apologized to her as an adult, which she seemed to have accepted, and I know much of it stemmed from being bullied and abused throughout those years myself. However, I can’t seem to get past how I contributed to a lousy childhood for my sister — someone for whom I would now do anything and who will barely speak to me and the rest of our family. Carolyn Hax started her advice column in 1997, after five years as a copy editor and news editor in Style and none as a therapist. The column includes cartoons by \\"relationship cartoonist\\" Nick Galifianakis -- Carolyn's ex-husband -- and appears in over 200 newspapers. I know that now I would make different choices but can’t undo the past. How do I forgive myself? Seeking Forgiveness: I think this weight you’re carrying, the painful awareness of your past behavior, is proof you’ve grown into a decent, empathetic person. It hurts, like flipping on an overhead light first thing in the morning. But it’s still important and good. When going back and fixing something isn’t possible, or when you’ve apologized and still don’t feel better, then I think all any of us can do is make a conscious effort to be good. It’s not so much “paying it forward,” since that’s about returning favors to strangers — call it “fixing it forward.” Do also remain in regular, arm’s-length contact with your sister — every few months, noting birthdays or Christmas or milestones, for example, with respectful personal notes. Not often enough to crowd her, but enough to let her know that she’s welcome if she’s ever ready to come to you. Dear Carolyn: My mom is a lifelong chain-smoker. No chance of getting her to quit: She loves everything about it, and the mental gymnastics she will go through to justify it would be funny if they weren’t so sad. She even gave my uncle, who had a portion of a lung removed and is in chemo to combat lung cancer, a cigarette last weekend because, “Well, he wanted one and it made him so happy!” The issue: We are renting a house in a tropical location in a few weeks and she is the only smoker out of 10 people. I am considering asking her to use an e-cigarette while we’re there. Do you have any suggestions on making this request more successful? She genuinely doesn’t care about other people’s health or comfort in this department. She found a “study” once on the Internet that said smoking did not actually cause cancer. The group we’re going with is, uh, volatile enough without the stress of a nonstop cloud of stink and the hacking cough that accompanies my mom everywhere. Vacationer: I hope the house is nonsmoking, per the lease. “She genuinely doesn’t care” plus belief that smoking isn’t a health hazard equals no, there is no other way to get a message through to this person. Unless you’re prepared to set out conditions — either e-smoke or outside — and exclude her from the trip if she refuses to agree to them. Fingers crossed that it doesn’t rain.

Tehran not only blocked access to a site the inspectors believe could have been used for tests on how to produce a nuclear weapon, they reported, but it also refused to agree to a process for resolving questions about other “possible military dimensions” to its nuclear program.      The announcement came in a terse press release from the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations agency, which said its inspection team had left the country. The agency is expected to release its latest report on the status of Iran’s program in the next week.      The inspectors’ previous visit to Iran ended several weeks ago with no agreement other than to meet this week.      Iran’s refusal to deal with the inspectors’ questions is likely to increase tension, at a moment of heightened sanctions and after the assassination of nuclear scientists in Iran and suspected retaliation against Israeli diplomats. Iran struck an increasingly bellicose tone on Tuesday, with an Iranian official warning that the country would take pre-emptive action against perceived foes if it felt its national interests were threatened. The country also laid down new conditions for oil sales.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Iran also indicated in recent days, however, that it was willing to resume negotiations over its nuclear program, but it was unclear under what terms. ||||| CAIRO — China, Russia and Iran all made declarations of support for the Syrian government on Tuesday, reaffirming their alliances in the face of broad, intense international lobbying for unity against President Bashar al-Assad as his nearly yearlong crackdown on domestic opponents has sharpened against restive areas.      The worst violence on Tuesday was reported in the central city of Homs, which has been under sustained assault for more than two weeks. The day’s toll of that city’s residents, as compiled by various groups that try to track the violence from inside and outside the country, ranged from 16 to more than 40 killed. At the same time, the faction of the opposition that is armed has claimed several more lives, according to the Syrian government, whose news agency reported the funerals of three soldiers killed in or near Damascus and in the city of Hama, to the north.      Russia announced that it would not participate in a meeting in Tunisia on Friday of a contact group of Western and Arab nations, Friends of Syria, where opposition figures were expected to lobby for greater international recognition and support. The Syrian government’s news agency, SANA, reported that a Chinese special envoy to the Middle East, Wu Sike, visited Damascus on Tuesday and called for dialogue with all sides in the crisis. SANA also reported from Beijing on a news conference by the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Li, in which he called for “the international community to respect the sovereignty, stability and unity of Syria.”      Mr. Li did not say whether China would attend the Friends of Syria conference.      Iranian officials, at a regular foreign ministry news conference in Tehran, did not explicitly discuss the conference, but denounced Western meddling in the affairs of its longstanding ally as benefiting Israel at the expense of those who resist its power. “What is happening in Syria serves the best interests of Israel and weakens the resistance,” said a ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, as quoted by SANA.      But the United States threw some of the Iranian’s support for Syria into question, suggesting that Iran’s reports that it has sent two warships to help train Syrian forces were false. “We have absolutely no indication whatsoever the Iranian ships ever docked in Syrian ports,” a Pentagon spokesman, George Little, was quoted by Reuters as saying.      Iran’s Press TV satellite broadcaster had said the two ships, a destroyer and a supply ship, docked in Tartus on Saturday “to provide maritime training to naval forces of Syria under an agreement signed between Tehran and Damascus a year ago.”      Red Cross officials did not respond to calls on Tuesday seeking to establish whether the organization’s efforts to secure even a brief ceasefire from government forces had been successful. But based on reports from activist groups and official Syrian media, the violence appeared unabated. Foreign journalists are generally not allowed in Syria, so such reports cannot be verified.      The assault on Homs appeared to be a continuation of the government attack on the city that began Feb. 4, after China and Russia vetoed a resolution condemning the violence and backing an Arab League plan for Mr. Assad to step aside. (Last week, in the strongest international rebuke to date, the General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to pass the same resolution in nonbinding form.)      A new Cairo-based group, the Activist News Association, has been collecting information from a network of “citizen journalist” contacts inside of Syria. Rami Jarrah, a Syrian activist who helped create the group, said that Syrian government and ground forces were massing outside of Homs. “Active resistance has long since stopped but the government is using the excuse of ‘armed resistance’, in quotes, to continue this bombardment,” Mr. Jarrah said. “They’re killing the democratic movement.”      Based on photographs of victims sent from inside Syria, he said, at least 79 deaths took place around the country on Tuesday, 46 of them in Homs, where shelling of the Sunni Arab neighborhood of Baba Amr was particularly heavy, and 33 in Idlib to the north. That toll was likely to rise, he said.      Another exile activist group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported that in the northern city of Aleppo, unknown gunmen shot and killed Mohammad Ramadan, a businessman who supported the government. It also reported scattered protests and skirmishing in the capital, Damascus, where a group of youths raised an opposition flag at the Al-Jaawzeh Bridge at the southern entrance of the capital, the London-based Observatory said.      Meanwhile, the Hamas authorities in the Gaza Strip allowed Palestinians to demonstrate against Mr. Assad for the first time, a move that came weeks after the top Hamas leadership abandoned its longtime base in Damascus. The unusual rally was organized by a group called the Palestinian Gathering to Support Syrian People, a new body run by the sons of late Hamas leaders from Gaza.      About 200 students rallied at Islamic University before marching with Palestinian and Syrian flags to downtown Gaza. There, some 100 more Palestinians joined the rally, including women. The protesters burned posters of Mr. Assad and carried banners bearing slogans like “Allah, Syria and Freedom,” and “Shame on Child Murderers.”      The Hamas leadership has refused to express support for Mr. Assad despite pressure from Iran, a main backer of Hamas. But with some 650,000 Palestinian refugees living inside Syria, Hamas officials are unlikely to draw Syrian ire by openly criticizing the leadership. ||||| A:","output":"Summary 1: International nuclear inspectors faced failure in their visit to Iran, where Tehran blocked access to a site believed to be used for nuclear weapon testing and refused to agree on a process to resolve questions about other possible military dimensions of its nuclear program.

Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia.

Working exclusively in short films, he has produced almost forty works since 1937, nine of which have been grouped together as the \\"Magick Lantern Cycle\\". His films variously merge surrealism with homoeroticism and the occult, and have been described as containing \\"elements of erotica, documentary, psychodrama, and spectacle\\". Anger himself has been described as \\"one of America's first openly gay filmmakers, and certainly the first whose work addressed homosexuality in an undisguised, self-implicating manner\\", and his \\"role in rendering gay culture visible within American cinema, commercial or otherwise, is impossible to overestimate\\", with several being released prior to the legalization of homosexuality in the United States. For twenty years from the early 1980s, Anger released no new material. In 2000, at the dawn of the new millennium, Anger began screening a new short film, the anti-smoking Don't Smoke That Cigarette, followed a year later by The Man We Want to Hang, which comprised images of Aleister Crowley's paintings that had been exhibited at a temporary exhibition in Bloomsbury, London. In 2004, he began showing Anger Sees Red, a short surrealistic film starring himself, and the same year also began showing another work, Patriotic Penis. He soon followed this with a flurry of other shorts, including Mouse Heaven, which consisted of images of Mickey Mouse memorabilia, Ich Will! and Uniform Attraction, all of which he showed at various public appearances. Anger's most recent project has been the Technicolor Skull with musician Brian Butler, described as a \\"magick ritual of light and sound in the context of a live performance\\", in which Anger plays the theremin, and Butler plays the guitar and other electronic instruments, behind a psychedelic backdrop of colors and skulls.  Anger makes an appearance in the 2008 feature documentary by Nik Sheehan about Brion Gysin and the Dreamachine titled FLicKeR. Anger also appears alongside Vincent Gallo in the 2009 short film \\"Night of Pan\\" written and directed by Brian Butler. In 2009 his work was featured in a retrospective exhibition at the MoMA PS1 in New York City, and the following year a similar exhibition took place in London.  Anger has finished writing Hollywood Babylon III, but has not yet published it, fearing severe legal repercussions if he did so. Of this he has stated that \\"The main reason I didn't bring it out was that I had a whole section on Tom Cruise and the Scientologists. I'm not a friend of the Scientologists.\\" Despite withholding legal action against the highly critical 2015 film Going Clear, the Church of Scientology was known on earlier occasions to heavily sue those making accusations against them.

Summarize this article: After a dour start, Cardiff led through Whittingham's neat finish, before Nahki Wells fired Huddersfield level. Loanee Lex Immers, making his first Cardiff start, restored their lead before Whittingham's stunning free-kick made the points safe. Harry Bunn smashed in a consolation for the hosts in second-half stoppage time. Defeat brought the Terriers' five-match unbeaten home run in all competitions to an end. Whittingham's opener brought the game time to life as he swept home Anthony Pilkington's cut-back, before Wells' low effort made it 1-1 before half-time. Dutchman Immers, who arrived on loan from Feyernoord earlier this month, finished off a fine team move after the break as Cardiff improved. Whittingham sealed the win direct from a free-kick with a superb finish, before Wells fed Bunn to give the Bluebirds a late scare in the closing stages, but the Welsh side held on. Huddersfield, who were without suspended defensive duo Mark Hudson and Tommy Smith, struggled to create openings and remain 17th in the Championship.

Thanks to misguided laws, they can't be refinanced and the debt can't be shed through bankruptcy. To make matters worse, the government uses an \\"army of private debt collectors\\" to harass student borrowers without relief. \\"How do we quit loading up 18-year-olds with a risky gamble that could impact the rest of their lives?\\" Some interesting proposals are out there, including one to refinance student loans at 4% and another that would link the amount students have to pay back to their income. \\"Ultimately, keeping college affordable is the answer,\\" writes Dayen, and Katrina vanden Heuvel at the Washington Post hits on a similar theme today. \\"This isn’t complicated,\\" she writes. \\"Washington should be moving boldly to make advanced education affordable for all. The federal government should be increasing grants to states for public colleges, on the condition that the states increase their own contributions and act to curb college costs.\\" Cracking down on shady for-profit colleges also would help. Plenty can be done, and vanden Heuvel writes that she hopes \\"student loans may be to this generation what the draft was to the boomers—the government folly that afflicts them personally and rouses them to act.\\" Click for her full column, or for Dayen's full column. Expand this summary.","output":"This passage touches on a significant issue plaguing the United States today: the student debt crisis. The author, David Dayen, postulates in his Salon article that student loans have become a crushing burden for many, citing their uniqueness as a form of debt that cannot be refinanced or discharged in bankruptcy. This is largely due to laws that he labels as ill-conceived. Adding to the onerous nature of student loans is the aggressive activity of private debt collecters employed by the government to hound the borrowers without providing any relief. So, what can be done to remedy this issue? The author poses the question as a form of challenge: how can we halt the trend of burying young adults, just starting out in life, under a mountain of debt that poses a risky gamble with the potential to negatively affect their entire lives? Thankfully, there are several interesting strategies mooted to deal with the problem, including a proposal to refinance the student loans at a lower interest rate of 4%, and another to adjust the repayment amount in line with the borrower's income. The ultimate solution according to Dayen, however, is to ensure that college remains affordable for the majority. Pursuing the theme of affordable education, Katrina vanden Heuvel of the Washington Post asserts in her piece that the situation doesn't require a complex solution. She advocates for strong action from Washington to make higher education accessible for everyone. One such action she suggests is for the federal government to increase its grants to state-run institutions, while demanding states to contribute more and introduce measures to stifle the soaring cost of college. Vanden Heuvel also shows a strong position against fraudulent for-profit colleges, advocating for stricter regulations on these institutions. Despite the severity of the problem, there is still hope. Van den Heuvel draws parallels with the draft experienced by the baby boomer generation, expressing her hope that the student loan issue could be the defining problem of the current generation leading them to take action. She encourages readers to delve more into this issue by reading her detailed column and the one penned by Dayen. In conclusion, both authors stress the importance of various measures to alleviate the student debt burden. They argue for the need to keep college affordable, the significance of appropriate student loan policies, and suggest that aggressive measures need to be taken against dubious for-profit colleges. They evoke the image of a motivated, socially-conscious generation taking the initiative to create a future where higher education is universally accessible, and not financially crippling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An American scientist claims that your personality might determine whether you like spicy food like chillis. An American scientist claims that your personality might determine whether you like spicy food. Pennsylvania State University's research examined the link between peoples' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot spices such as chilli. It found that people who seek adventure and intense sensations like spicy food more than those who avoid risky situations. Nadia Byrnes, a doctoral candidate at the university, conducted a study of 184 non-smoking participants between the ages of 18 and 45 without any known issues that would compromise their ability to taste. The group of people were primarily Caucasian and around 63 per cent were female. She assessed the group using the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking (AISS) test. This test looks at the personality trait of 'sensation-seeking'. This trait is defined as seeking out 'novel and intense stimulation' regardless of the risks involved. People who score above the mean AISS score are considered more open to risks and new experiences, while those scoring below the mean are considered less open to those things. The subjects were then given 25 micrometers of capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, and asked to rate how much they liked a spicy meal as the burn from the capsaicin increased in intensity. Those in the group who fell below the mean AISS rapidly disliked the meal as the burn increased. Pennsylvania State University's research examined the link between peoples' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot spices including chill, which is found in lots of curries (pictured) People who were above the mean AISS had a consistently liked the meal even as the burn increased. Those in the mean group liked the meal less as the burn increased, but not nearly as rapidly as those below the mean. Ms Byrnes said: 'Theoretically, we know that burn intensity and liking are linear related. The more irritating a compound or food gets, the less people should like it. 'But that's not always the case.' She presented her findings at the 2013 Institute of Food Technologists annual meeting and food expo. People were given 25 micrometers of capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, and asked to rate how much they liked a spicy meal as the burn from the capsaicin increased in intensity. The research found that people who actively seek adventure and intense sensations, like spicy food more than those who avoid risky situations. At the same event, Dr Shane McDonald, principal flavor chemist at Kalsec, discussed the addition of 'tingling' spices to foods. The practice is not very prevalent in the U.S. diet outside of carbonation. He said that 'Ma La,' a traditional Szechuan cuisine that combines chili peppers for their heat and Szechuan peppers for their tingle, shows promise for American food manufacturers. The combination of the two sensates enhances the tingling while reducing the heat, which could make certain traditionally spicy foods more appealing to consumers, he said.

The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos Gonzalez. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzon, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many of whom had been retired for years. The first performances by the full line up of Buena Vista Social Club, including Cooder, were those filmed by Wenders in Amsterdam and New York. Other international shows and T.V. appearances soon followed with varying line ups. Ibrahim Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez performed together in Los Angeles in 1998 to an audience that included Alanis Morissette, Sean Combs, and Jennifer Lopez, Ferrer dedicating the song Mami Me Gusto to the Hispanic Lopez.  Performances in Florida, which has a large Cuban exile and Cuban American community, were rare after the release of the film due to the political climate. In the late 1990s, a concert by Cuban jazz pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba turned into a near riot when concert goers were attacked and spat at by protesters opposed to the Cuban government. When \\"Buena Vista\\" musicians played for a music industry conference at Miami Beach in 1998, hundreds of protesters chanted outside and the convention center hall was cleared briefly because of a bomb threat. In 1999, Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez were forced to cancel Miami shows citing fears for their safety after fellow-Cubans Los Van Van drew 4,000 protesters at a previous show, and Compay Segundo was forced to cut short a 1999 Miami performance due to another bomb threat. When touring the U.S., the Cubans are only entitled to their per diem (transportation and lodging) and are not permitted performance fees due to the U.S. embargo. In 2001 a Buena Vista Social Club (with Ibrahim Ferrer) performance was recorded in Austin for PBS and broadcast on Austin City Limits in 2002.  Buena Vista Social Club continue to tour throughout the world as Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club, and despite the deaths of six of the original members, the collective performs with many of the remaining ensemble members including Barbarito Torres and \\"Guajiro\\" Mirabal. Ry Cooder's guitar parts are handled by Manuel Galban, a former member of Cuban vocal group Los Zafiros, who played on Ibrahim Ferrer's first solo record with Cooder and appeared in Wim Wenders' film. Following a 2007 performance in London, a reviewer at The Independent described the ensemble as \\"something of an anomaly in music business terms, due to their changing line-up and the fact that they've never really had one defining front person\\", adding, \\"It's hard to know what to expect from what is more of a brand than a band.\\" Where did they tour?","output":"The Buena Vista Social Club began touring internationally after the release of their debut album in 1997. They first performed as a full lineup, including Ry Cooder, in Amsterdam and New York, which were filmed by Wim Wenders. They continued to perform in various international shows and TV appearances with different lineups. Some notable performances took place in Los Angeles in 1998, with Ibrahim Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez playing to an audience that included celebrities such as Alanis Morissette, Sean Combs, and Jennifer Lopez. However, their performances in Florida were rare due to the political climate surrounding Cuban artists. In the late 1990s, several concerts in Miami were either canceled or cut short because of protests and bomb threats against the Cuban performers. The ensemble continued to tour worldwide, even after the passing of some original members, as the Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club. Some of the countries and cities they performed in include various locations in Europe, such as London, and in the United States, with a notable performance recorded in Austin for PBS in 2001 and broadcast on Austin City Limits in 2002. While the lineup and featured musicians continued to change over the years, the Buena Vista Social Club remained a significant presence in the music world, showcasing the rich musical traditions of pre-revolutionary Cuba and sharing that heritage with audiences around the globe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"russian fighter jet crashes pilots ejects safely\\" Text:","output":"Title: Russian Fighter Jet Crashes, Pilots Eject Safely In a dramatic turn of events, a Russian fighter jet crashed earlier today during a routine training mission. The incident, which highlights the inherent danger and unpredictability of military aviation, saw both pilots managing to eject safely before the aircraft was completely destroyed. The fighter jet in question, a state-of-the-art Sukhoi Su-30 developed by Russia's premier aircraft manufacturer, Sukhoi Corporation, is one of the most advanced and efficient combat aircraft produced by the country. The twin-engine, two-seat jet boasts a host of technologically sophisticated features and impressive maneuverability, and is regarded as a major player within the global arena of multi-role fighter aircraft. The fateful incident took place in a secluded area during the early hours of the day, with preliminary reports suggesting that the pilots were conducting a standard military exercise. Upon encountering unexpected complications, the skilled aviators adhered to protocol and made the critical decision to abort the mission, subsequently ejecting themselves from the cockpit using the aircraft's inbuilt K-36DM ejection seats. Fortunately, the pilots managed to escape the wreckage nearly unscathed and were recovered by an awaiting helicopter search-and-rescue team. The Russian Ministry of Defense, in an official statement, confirmed that both pilots are now in stable condition, following a thorough medical evaluation at a nearby military hospital. They will continue to undergo monitoring and receive any necessary treatment to ensure their well-being and readiness to return to duty. It is currently unclear what caused the sophisticated aircraft to crash, an aspect that has spurred the commencement of a thorough investigation by the Russian government and relevant aviation authorities. The outcome of this investigation is expected to provide valuable insights into the aircraft's technical details and performance. Additionally, any potential vulnerabilities or manufacturing defects will be identified, allowing for the implementation of corrective measures and augmenting the reliability of the aircraft in future operations. The safety of military personnel remains a paramount concern for nations globally, and the quick thinking and decisive actions exhibited by both pilots involved in this incident are a testament to their rigorous training and commitment to duty. The Russian government, while tackling this rare occurrence, has also extended appreciation for the swift response of search-and-rescue teams, crediting their timely intervention for the successful recovery of the pilots. As the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash continues, it is vital to recognize the sacrifices that military personnel make to ensure the security and safety of their nation. Moreover, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in military aviation, as well as the need for continuous evaluation and improvement in aircraft design and technology. The findings of the ongoing investigation will hold significant implications for Russia's military strategy, providing essential information to facilitate improvements in both the aircraft's manufacturing and the training protocols of pilots. The unwavering resolve of the Russian military, as demonstrated through this event, is a stark indication of its commitment to understanding and addressing the potential challenges that lie ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of modern warfare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Serial attention-seeker Andrew Davies, 51, was given the anti-social behaviour order after he took to lying in the road and feigning injuries in order to dupe passing motorists into calling him an ambulance. Incredibly, the order bans Davies from deliberately falling over and lying on the ground anywhere in England or Wales, if he is doing it to for attention. Andrew Davies, 51, was given an ASBO  after he took to lying in the road and feigning injuries for attention. A court heard how he began pestering emergency services with prank calls but later went to increasingly bizarre lengths to get his kicks, as neighbours and ambulance crews became familiar with his antics and tried to ignore him. After being persuaded by police to give up his mobile phone, Davies decided to attract attention instead by wandering the streets near his home in Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, before pretending to fall over and acting as though he had been injured. When his increasingly fed-up neighbours began ignoring his amateur dramatics, he took to busy main roads nearby and would lie on the ground, pretending he had been hit by a car, until someone stopped to assist him. Davies was handed the two-year ASBO, which also prohibits him from being drunk in a public place and calling the emergency services unless in a genuine emergency, by magistrates in High Wycombe. The bench ruled that the ASBO was necessary to protect the public and emergency services from the consequences of his anti-social behaviour. PC Chris Allman, from Thames Valley Police, said: 'Davies came to police attention initially by making time-wasting calls to the emergency services. On most occasions he would be intoxicated. 'When dealt with by a police and council joint team he gave away his telephone to stop the temptation. However he then took to pretending to fall in the street near his home as a way of attracting attention to himself. 'He would lay there feigning an injury until an ambulance attended. Local residents came to know what he was doing and started to ignore him and regard him as a nuisance. Davies then would orchestrate his falls on a nearby main road whereby he would be seen by a larger number of people. High Wycombe Magistrates' Court (pictured) where Davies was given the ASBO. He is banned from deliberately falling over, drinking in public, and contacting the emergency services unless it is a genuine emergency. 'Numerous motorists have done the decent thing and stopped to assist the man laying on the ground. Not realising they were being duped, they invariably would call an ambulance to attend to him. 'The ambulance staff and paramedics would normally recognise Davies and know what he was doing but were duty-bound to deal with him professionally. On a number of occasions he was taken to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury where he was more thoroughly checked over but he was always discharged as having no injuries. 'He has been offered support from numerous agencies and given many opportunities to change his behaviour. Davies' continual lack of engagement has ultimately resulted in this town wide ASBO.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"A man named Andrew Davies was given a special rule called an ASBO. This rule says he can't pretend to fall over or get hurt just to get attention from other people or emergency helpers like ambulances in England and Wales. He used to do things like lying in the street and pretending to be hurt so people would call for an ambulance. The people in his town and the ambulance helpers got very tired of this, so he got this special rule to try to make him stop.

Given the question: Children who grow up in households where books are plentiful go further in school than those without books, a new study finds. This book benefit was seen across countries, and held regardless of the parent's educational back-ground, father's occupation or the political system of the country, the researchers say. The results, based on data from 73,249 people living in 27 countries, including the United States, show that having a 500-book library boosted a child's education by 3.2 years on average. \\"You get a great effect for your books,\\" said study researcher Mariah Evans, a sociologist at the University of Nevada, Reno. \\"It's quite a good return-on-investment in a time of scarce resources.\\" For years, educators have thought the strongest predictor of attaining high levels of education was having parents who were highly educated. But according to the findings, a good-sized book library is just as good as university-educated parents in terms of increasing education level. \\"Even a little bit goes a long way,\\" in terms of the number of books in a home, Evans said. Having as few as 20 books in the home still has a significant impact on propelling a child to a higher level of education, and the more books are added, the greater the benefit. In some countries, such as China, having 500 or more books in the home propels children 6. 6 years further in their education. In the United States, the effect is less, 2.4 years. But, Evans points out that 2.4 years is still a significant advantage in terms of educational achievement. For example, Americans who have some college or an associate's degree, but not a bachelor's degree, earn an average of  7,213 more annually than those with just a high school education. Those who attain a bachelor's degree earn  21,185 more each year, on average, than those with just high school diplomas. Having books in the home is twice as important as the father's education level, and more important than whether a child was educated in China or the United States.

Please answer the following question: Michael has become bored with his passive life style, and has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby. He begins to exercise with weights several times a week. Michael's brother, Robert, isn't as motivated as Michael though. Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months.  Who will increase the size of their muscles more?  Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Michael will increase the size of his muscles more than Robert. This is because Michael exercises with weights several times a week, while Robert exercises with weights only every couple of months. Using skeletal muscles, such as during weight lifting, increases their size and strength. In order for the muscles to remain bigger and stronger, continued exercise is necessary. Since Michael is consistently exercising and challenging his muscles, he will see more significant muscle growth and strength improvements compared to his brother Robert, who exercises infrequently. Essentially, Michael is following the \\"use it or lose it\\" principle for muscle growth and strength."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole).

Mike needs to find the differences between the patients to come up with recommendations for them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which patient would have higher reflex time, patient A or patient B?  Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. The answer is:","output":"Patient B Step 1: Analyze the question and information given in the hint. The question asks which patient would have a higher reflex time. The hint provided mentions that during late adulthood, reflex time typically increases. Step 2: Determine the age category of each patient. Patient A is in early adulthood, while Patient B is in late adulthood. Step 3: Compare the age categories with the information given in the hint. Since Patient B is in late adulthood and the hint mentions that reflex time typically increases during late adulthood, we can infer that Patient B would have a higher reflex time.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

This planet is almost an exact copy of Earth, but it is currently uninhabited by intelligent life. Upon landing, the explorers name the planet Caprica and begin learning as much as they can. They discover that the species on this Caprica are nearly all the same as on Earth, and even most of the topography looks the same. However, the main difference is that humans never evolved here. For this reason, there are no cities or cars or factories to burn up fossil fuels.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Does Earth have more or less greenhouse gases than Caprica?  Hint: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  Paragraph: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Jessica's plan? A:","output":"Under Jessica's plan, the number of animals is likely to decrease. Jessica's proposal to emit more anthropogenic gases would contribute to an increase in greenhouse gases, further exacerbating global warming and climate change. Such changes adversely impact natural habitats and ecosystems, leading to a reduction in wildlife populations. Therefore, Jessica's plan would likely result in a negative outcome for the planet and its biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible.

Media caption The anti-Gaddafi fighters at Sirte are made up of battalions from Misrata      Libya's interim authorities say their fighters have entered the outskirts of the coastal city of Sirte, one of the last places still loyal to ex-leader Col Muammar Gaddafi.      Fighters had breached defences south and west of the city, about 8km (5 miles) from the centre on Thursday evening, but met heavy resistance, the National Transitional Council said.      Meanwhile, Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan has arrived in Libya as part of a tour asserting Ankara's regional influence and promoting democracy.      His visit comes a day after crowds in Benghazi cheered UK PM David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the first foreign leaders to visit since Col Gaddafi was ousted.      'We are strong'      An NTC spokesman told the BBC that fighters had been forced to retreat about two kilometres to treat casualties following their incursion into the outlying areas of Sirte, where they reportedly clashed with snipers in a high-rise tower and an elite unit of pro-Gaddafi troops.      The anti-Gaddafi fighters - made up of battalions from Misrata, 200km (120 miles) to the west - suffered at least four deaths and seven wounded, although a report quoting the Misrata Military Council said 11 were killed and 34 hurt.      Col Gaddafi's spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, told a Syrian TV channel that \\"thousands of volunteers\\" were ready to \\"liberate Libya\\" from the NTC.      \\"We are in fact strong. We have the capabilities, the means and plans to liberate the whole of Libya,\\" he said in a phone call to the pro-Gaddafi al-Rai channel.      NTC fighters are facing resistance in a handful of pro-Gaddafi bastions, including the desert town of Bani Walid, the southern outpost of Sabha and Sirte, Col Gaddafi's birthplace.      Last week anti-Gaddafi forces said they were hours from taking Bani Walid, but were driven back. One unconfirmed report suggested columns of anti-Gaddafi fighters would again move on the town on Friday.      \\"We have received orders from our commanders and we are going into Bani Walid today from different locations,\\" fighter Mohammed Jwaida, stationed some 20km north of the town, was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.      Rapturous reception      The BBC's Peter Biles, in Tripoli, says the visit of Mr Cameron and Mr Sarkozy left many people in Tripoli and Benghazi clearly elated.      Image caption Abir: \\"I sense that they are here to explore the situation, to find out what people think of our liberation. It is a big and positive step and it is also reassuring for our people on a security level. Since they feel safe to visit Tripoli it means that there is security and stability.\\" Since [the leaders] feel safe to visit Tripoli, it means that there is security and stability In pictures: Battle for SirteLibyan voices on leaders' visit      The leaders arrived in Tripoli on Thursday morning where they held talks with Libya's interim leader, NTC chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil, pledged support for the NTC and announced a series of measures, including the unfreezing of billions in Libyan assets and funding for landmine clearance.      It signalled another step on the road to normality for Libya, a country that was considered, for a large part of Col Gaddafi's years in power, a pariah state, our correspondent says.      In particular, the visit was an important boost for the members of Libya's interim administration, as they strive to consolidate their authority and legitimacy in Tripoli, he adds.      Under heavy security, Mr Cameron and Mr Sarkozy travelled to Benghazi, the NTC's eastern stronghold and the seat of Libya's revolution.      There, thousands of people filled central Liberty Square, cheering so loudly that the leaders struggled to make themselves heard.      \\"It is great to be in free Libya,\\" Mr Cameron told the crowd. \\"Col Gaddafi said he would hunt you down like rats, but you showed the courage of lions.\\"      Gaddafi inner circle      On Friday, the NTC is to send a delegation to neighbouring Niger in an effort to recover gold and cash believed to have been taken out of Libya by fleeing Gaddafi loyalists.      Mr Sarkozy and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe will also meet Niger's leadership on Friday.      At least 36 members of the fugitive leader's inner circle, including relatives and generals, have fled to neighbouring Algeria and Niger since Tripoli fell to NTC forces last month.      Mr Abdul Jalil said Libya would also ask for the handover of individuals wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC).      The ICC has indicted Col Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam and his intelligence chief for crimes against humanity. ||||| Libyan rebels claimed to have captured Sirte, the birthplace of Muammar Gaddafi and the last of his coastal strongholds.      The city was said to have fallen after an attack involving 900 \\"technicals\\" – armed pickup trucks – that attacked loyalist positions from three directions.      \\"Thwar Misrata (the Misrata revolution) now control the entrances to Sirte city,\\" said a statement from the Misrata military council.      The council, which controlled the operation, said the attack began at dawn on Thursday with an assault on the front line, 30 miles west of the city.      Gaddafi loyalists resisted with artillery, mortars and long-range grad rockets, but frontline positions collapsed in the early afternoon and rebel units surged eastwards towards the city.      More street fighting followed in the city, but by nightfall rebel units said they were in control of Sirte centre and the exit roads, and were \\"combing\\" urban areas for key Gaddafi officials believed to be in hiding.      Pockets of resistance remained, with loyalist forces surrounded in the city centre headquarters of an insurance company. Units of the 32nd brigade, commanded by Gaddafi's son Khamis, were reported to be barricaded into a line of villas along the Sirte beachfront.      Nato reported destroying eight targets on Wednesday night part of a bombing campaign that has seen it strike 292 targets, including tanks, ammunition dumps, command centres and barracks, in the past three weeks. Alliance jets were in the air during the battle though it is not known if they struck targets today.      Nato is also anxious to get the war over, as its mandate runs out on 27 September, and France and the UK would prefer to have the war finished by then, rather than ask for an extension in what has proved a controversial operation.      Sirte, built near the site of the ancient Phoenician city of Macomedes-Euphranta, is one of Gaddafi's key military hubs.      The coastal city was first targeted on 20 March, the second day of the air war, when American B2 stealth bombers destroyed 45 hardened aircraft shelters at Gardabya airport, which also served as a military airbase.      Rebel forces reported two fighters killed and five more wounded, but said the figure may rise as casualties return to bases and hospitals in Misrata, 150 miles to the west.      A Sirte rebel, who escaped the town on Monday to join opposition forces, told the Guardian that any attacking force must cope with the hostility of the Gaddafi tribe who remain loyal to the former Libyan leader and have formed bands of militias.      The conquest, if confirmed, represents a major victory for Libya's rebels; symbolically it is the crushing of Gaddafi's authority. More practically, it opens the main east-west coastal highway, allowing the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council to move by road to the capital, Tripoli. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The fighters in Libya who are against Gaddafi have gone into the city of Sirte, which is one of the last cities that still supports Gaddafi. They are trying to take control of the city, but the people who support Gaddafi are fighting back. Some important leaders from other countries, like the United Kingdom's Prime Minister David Cameron and France's President Nicolas Sarkozy, have visited Libya to show their support for the people trying to remove Gaddafi from power. If the fighters can take control of Sirte, it will be a big victory for them and make it easier for them to bring peace and democracy to Libya."},{"instruction":"Question: Francisco Javier Alcaraz (born 4 October 1960) is a Paraguayan football forward who played for Paraguay in the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

Look in notices in the paper, online, or ask around for recommendations by word-of-mouth.","output":"Book your hayride in advance Once you've found a location that offers a hayride, check their website or call them to find out if they require advance reservations. Some hayrides might only operate during specific times of the year, like autumn, so it's essential to check their hours of operation. If a reservation is necessary, be sure to book your spot early to secure your preferred date and time. This also gives you ample time to organize your schedule and make travel plans. Choose the right time Hayrides are typically more enjoyable during the evening when the air is cool, and you may have a better chance of seeing wildlife or enjoying a sunset or views of the night sky. If the hayride is being offered as part of a larger event, such as a pumpkin patch or fall festival, consider visiting earlier in the day to participate in other festivities before embarking on your hayride. Dress appropriately Since hayrides are typically held outdoors, it's crucial to dress comfortably and appropriately for the weather. Be sure to check the forecast and be prepared for fluctuating temperatures, especially if you'll be on the ride during the evening. Wear layers that you can adjust as needed; consider a sweater, flannel shirt, or jacket. Shoes should be comfortable and suitable for walking on potentially uneven terrain, like sneakers or boots. And, while hayrides can be a bit dusty, don't forget a hat, sunglasses, or even a light scarf to cover your face, should the need arise. Bring along supplies and snacks When going on a hayride, you might want to bring some essentials with you. If your hayride allows it, pack some snacks and drinks for the duration of the ride. Make sure they are securely contained to prevent spills during bumpy rides. If you have kids, consider bringing some toys or games to keep them entertained. You might want to have a blanket or small cushion to make the ride even more comfortable, especially if you have young children or older family members joining you. Consider a hayride theme Some hayrides offer themed options, like haunted hayrides or Christmas hayrides. These can be a fun way to celebrate the season or a holiday. Consider researching the different hayrides available near you and finding one that will provide the best experience for you and your family or friends. Ensure safety and cleanliness It's essential to make sure that the hayride facility you choose maintains a safe and clean environment. Look for reviews from previous guests, and be prepared with hand sanitizer, face masks, and any other personal protective equipment you feel necessary. Make it a social event Inviting friends or family to join you on your hayride adventure can make the experience even more enjoyable. With a larger group, you'll have more people to engage with and create lasting memories. Additionally, coordinating a group outing could potentially save you money if the hayride company offers group discounts. Capture the moments Bring along a camera or smartphone to capture the memories you'll create on your hayride. Take plenty of pictures of the scenic views, your friends, and family having fun, and any interesting sights along the way. These photos will serve as a great reminder of your enjoyable hayride experience. Create or participate in traditions Consider making hayrides a seasonal family tradition for you and your loved ones. This can help create lasting memories, provide an opportunity to bond with each other, and give everyone something to look forward to every year. Additionally, participate in any traditions or fun activities the hayride venue or accompanying event might offer, like pumpkin carving, apple picking, or decorating cookies. By following these steps and tips, you can ensure that you and your loved ones enjoy a fun, safe, and memorable hayride experience.

We have: -200 + 11766 = -1096x - 9810 - 9312 First, we need to combine the numbers on each side of the equation. Let's start with the left side: -200 + 11766 = 11566 So now we have: 11566 = -1096x - 9810 - 9312 Now, let's focus on the right side. We need to add -9810 and -9312: -9810 - 9312 = -19122 Now the equation looks like this: 11566 = -1096x - 19122 Next, we want to get the x term (-1096x) all by itself on the right side. We do this by adding 19122 to both sides of the equation: 11566 + 19122 = -1096x After adding these two numbers we get: 30688 = -1096x Now we need to find out what x is. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -1096: 30688 / -1096 = x After we divide, we get: x = -28 So, the answer to the equation is: x = -28"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @shapeshed Cool, i got back from there 4 weeks ago, best holiday ever......","output":"To describe the sentiment of this tweet, we could start by breaking down the elements that contribute to its overall emotional tone. In this case, the tweet conveys a predominantly positive sentiment, as evidenced by several factors.  1. Use of the term \\"Cool\\": By starting with \\"Cool,\\" the user expresses a positive reaction to whatever information they were given by @shapeshed, likely about the location mentioned in the tweet. The use of this term reflects a general appreciation or interest in the topic that has been mentioned. 2. Timeframe of the experience: The user mentions having returned from a particular place 4 weeks ago. By sharing this information, they provide context about how recent the event was. This conveys that they still have vivid memories of this holiday and may still be riding on the positive emotions associated with it, emphasizing its importance to them. 3. Enthusiasm for the holiday: The user then goes on to describe the experience as the \\"best holiday ever.\\" This statement clearly highlights the user's extreme satisfaction and happiness derived from their vacation. The use of the superlative \\"best\\" denotes that this particular holiday outshines all others they might have had, making it especially memorable and noteworthy. 4. Use of ellipsis: The tweet ends with an ellipsis (a series of three dots), which suggests a trailing off in thought. This can signal a reminiscing tone, as if the user is reflecting on the wonderful time they had during their holiday. The ellipsis implies that there might be more to say, but that the user is keeping these thoughts to themselves, possibly due to the character limit on Twitter or simply a desire to maintain a sense of personal nostalgia. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as positive, happy, and enthusiastic, with a hint of wistfulness in the ellipsis at the end. The user shares their excitement and appreciation for a recent holiday, using superlatives and a friendly tone, while also indicating that this experience left a strong, positive impression on them that they continue to cherish weeks after the event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Arthur succeeds as King of Britain?  Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, completed c. 1138, contains the first narrative account of Arthur's life. This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again. The answer to this question is:","output":"Uther Pendragon"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

In the ceremony held at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, Chief Executive Donald Tsang handed the torch to the first torchbearer, Olympic medalist Lee Lai Shan. The torch relay then traveled through Nathan Road, Lantau Link, Sha Tin (crossed Shing Mun River via a dragon boat, which had been never used before in the history of Olympic torch relays), Victoria Harbour (crossed by Tin Hau, a VIP vessel managed by the Marine Department) before ending in Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai.

No politicians from the pro-democracy camp were selected as torchbearers. One torchbearer could not participate due to flight delay. It was estimated that more than 200,000 spectators came out and watched the relay. Many enthusiastic supporters wore red shirts and waved large Chinese flags.

He was nervous because he didn't really believe in it. Fred diligently lined up with his co-workers on the picket line. They yelled and got angry at customers crossing their line. Fred finally had enough and got a job at a non-union store. Sentence: fred is not very strong willed","output":"The text provided describes the situation of Fred, who worked at a grocery store that was about to go on strike. He felt nervous as he didn't quite believe in the strike, but he participated in the picket line along with his co-workers regardless. They yelled and showed their anger towards customers crossing their line, but eventually, Fred had enough and decided to get a job at a non-union store.  The sentence \\"Fred is not very strong-willed\\" can be considered true to some extent when analyzing the situation. Here are some reasons why: 1. Lack of Conviction: Fred didn't really believe in the strike but chose to participate in it, showing that he wasn't strong-willed enough to stand up for his beliefs and refrain from engaging in an activity that he didn't genuinely support. 2. Influence of Peer Pressure: Fred's decision to join the picket line despite having doubts about the strike can be seen as giving in to peer pressure. Had he been more strong-willed, he might have been able to resist this pressure and make a decision based on his own beliefs. 3. Change of Job: Finally, Fred decided to leave the union grocery store and find a job at a non-union store. This decision, while demonstrating initiative and a desire for change, also highlights that he wasn't strong-willed enough to stay and try to make a difference at his previous workplace. However, it is important to consider that demonstrating adaptability, flexibility, and the ability to make pragmatic decisions in difficult situations can also be seen as strengths. Fred felt unhappy with the situation in his workplace and the strike, making the decision to leave a union store for a non-union one; it could be argued that this may represent a display of strength in recognizing his own values and priorities. In conclusion, from the text, it can be determined that the statement \\"Fred is not very strong-willed\\" is true to some degree, but it is crucial to consider that his actions may also be viewed as a show of self-awareness and adaptability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read all the given sentences carefully and try to understand the overall idea of the short story. 2. Identify the starting point or context-setting sentence. In this case, it is Sentence2, which talks about the protagonist's desire to see the sloths and provides context for their visit to the zoo. 3. Identify the sentence that logically follows the starting point. Sentence3 mentions the protagonist visiting the zoo with friends, so that comes next in the sequence. 4. Continue the story's logical progression by selecting the sentence that fits best after the previous one. After visiting the zoo, Sentence5 tells us that they visited almost all exhibits without seeing any sloths. 5. Now, look for any remaining sentences that contribute to the story's resolution or climax. In this case, Sentence4 mentions that they finally find the sloths in the last exhibit, so it comes next. 6. The last sentence should wrap up the story. Sentence1 says they're gratified, which makes sense as a conclusion since they finally found the sloths they were seeking.

Article: Have you ever been stuck  for hours on a hard math problem? If you sat there for some time you might eventually solve it, but scientists say that daydreaming might be a much better way to tackle  difficult tasks. In fact, daydreaming has long been misunderstood. It's considered to be a bad thing and often associated with laziness. \\"We're harsh  on ourselves if we catch ourselves mind wandering,\\" says Professor Kalina Christoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada. But the truth is that some of the most important scientific discoveries came about because scientists allowed their minds to wander. For example, Albert Einstein began his theory of relativity  when he daydreamed about riding a beam  of sunlight to the edge of the universe. And now, research has shown that normal people can also improve their problems solving ability in the same way, reported The Telegraph. In a study, 145 people aged between 19 and 32 were asked to list as many unusual uses as possible for everyday objects. Some of them were given a 12-minute break while the others were not allowed any break from the task. People on the break did not simply relax--some of them were told to carry out a tiring memory task while others did an easier task. Scientists found that people who did the easier task were daydreaming a lot. They thought about personal issues in the past or in the future because their mind was at ease. After the break, all participants were asked to return once again to the task of listing unusual uses for everyday objects. It was found that daydreamers improved their performance by 40 percent, while all the other people, including those who didn't have a break and who did tiring tasks during the break, performed the same as before. \\"People think that when the mind wanders away, it just gets turned off--but we show the opposite,\\" explained Christoff.\\"A more playful attitude might allow you to call in more resources .\\" So when you are struggling to solve complicated problems, it might be better off if you switch to a...

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Not long ago, people could only buy organic food in small shops. Today it is common in most major supermarkets. The reason for the increase is that more and more people are demanding food grown without chemicals. Since the 1990s, organic farm production has gone up 20 percent every year. This pattern is expected to continue around the globe. Australia leads the world in land used for organic agriculture. It has four times as much land devoted to organic farming as all of Asia. However, most of the land is not very fertile, and it only produces a modest amount of food. Argentina is a distant second, followed by Brazil, the United States and China. In Africa, only a very small amount of land is registered for organic farming. That does not mean Africa relies on chemicals. In fact, many farmers do not use chemicals because they cannot afford them. Yet there are no programs for these farmers to prove they do not use chemicals. Without these programs their food can never be approved organic. India has had the most dramatic recent increase in organic farming. Like many other countries, India sees continual growth in organic food sales around the world. This, of course, leads to growth in profits. Sales of organic food were more than doubled from 2000 to 2005. Like India, many countries are trying to increase commercial organic farming to get a share of the sales. This has led to criticism. Some people believe that organic farming should not just be about making money. They think the goal is to help the environment. Others say organic farming will not continue if it is not profitable. They say that people should be able to make money while providing food that is healthy to mankind. Answer:","output":"Which of the following statements about organic farming and its growth is true based on the article? A) Organic farming has only recently begun to gain popularity in small shops. B) Australia has the most land devoted to organic farming, but it only produces a modest amount of food due to soil fertility issues. C) Argentina is the leading country in terms of land used for organic agriculture, followed by Brazil and the United States. D) African farmers widely rely on chemicals for farming and have well-established organic certification programs.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Information:  - Field artillery is a category of mobile artillery used to support armies in the field. These weapons are specialized for mobility, tactical proficiency, long range, short range and extremely long range target engagement.  - Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry.  - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.  - Fortifications are military constructions or buildings designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and also used to solidify rule in a region during peace time. Humans have constructed defensive works for many thousands of years, in a variety of increasingly complex designs. The term is derived from the Latin \\"fortis\\" (\\"strong\\") and \\"facere\\" (\\"to make\\").  - A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault. This derives from \\"sedere\\", Latin for \\"to sit\\". Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy.  - A tractor unit (prime mover or traction unit) is a characteristically heavy-duty towing engine that provides motive power for hauling a towed or trailered load. These fall into two categories: very heavy-duty typically off-road capable, often 6×6, military and commercial tractor units, including ballast tractors, and heavy and medium duty military and commercial rear-wheel drive \\"semi tractors\\" used for hauling semi-trailers.  - A ballast tractor is a specially weighted tractor unit of a heavy hauler combination. It is designed to utilize a drawbar to pull or push heavy or exceptionally large trailored loads. When feasible, lowboy-style semi-trailers are used to minimize a load's center of gravity. Typical drivetrains are 6×4 and 6×6.  - In international arms control, small arms include revolvers and pistols, rifles and carbines, assault rifles, submachine guns and light machine guns. Together with light weapons (heavy machine guns; hand-held grenade launchers; portable anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns; recoilless rifles; portable launchers of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile systems; and mortars of calibres of less than 100 mm), they comprise the Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) protocol.  - A half-track is a civilian or military vehicle with regular wheels at the front for steering and continuous tracks at the back to propel the vehicle and carry most of the load. The purpose of this combination is to produce a vehicle with the cross-country capabilities of a tank and the handling of a wheeled vehicle.  - Self-propelled artillery (also called mobile artillery or locomotive artillery) is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move towards its target. Within the term are covered self-propelled guns (or howitzers) and rocket artillery. They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on continuous tracks carrying either a large howitzer, field gun, a mortar or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield.  - A semi-trailer (British English) or semitrailer (American English) is a trailer without a front axle. In the US, the term is also used to refer to the combination of a truck and a semi-trailer, a tractor-trailer.  - An artillery tractor , also referred to as a gun tractor , is a specialized heavy - duty form of tractor unit used to tow artillery pieces of varying weights and calibres . It may be wheeled , tracked , or half - tracked .  - A siege engine is a device that is designed to break or circumvent city walls and other fortifications in siege warfare. Some have been operated close to the fortifications, while others have been used to attack from a distance. From antiquity, siege engines were constructed largely of wood and tended to use mechanical advantage to fling stones and similar missiles. With the development of gunpowder and improved metallurgical techniques, siege engines became artillery. Collectively, siege engines or artillery together with the necessary troops and transport vehicles to conduct a siege are referred to as a siege-train.

Summarize this article in one sentence. If you are making a homemade savory pie, cook all meats, vegetables, and other ingredients for the filling as if you intend to bake the pie immediately after.  In other words, don’t freeze uncooked or undercooked filling ingredients and expect them to cook through in the oven later. Uncooked or undercooked meats could pose a serious health hazard. This is one of the many elements of frozen pie baking in which you can easily find a wide range of opinions.  Your best bet is to try the different methods and see which works for you.  Some cooks recommend cooking the filling and freezing it and the (unrolled) pie crust separately in labeled freezer bags.  In this case, you would allow each element to thaw to the point to which you could assemble the pie.  Others, however, prefer the method of assembling the pie then freezing it whole.  That way, you can pop it straight from the freezer into the oven.  In this instance, don’t freeze the pie in a glass dish as it could shatter in the oven. Not surprisingly, a frozen pie will take a bit longer to cook through than an unfrozen one.  You may also find that you need to reduce the temperature a little so that the edges don’t burn before the center cooks through.  For example, one pot pie recipe recommends baking unfrozen at 400 °F (204 °C) for about 30 minutes, and frozen at 375 °F (191 °C)  for up to 45 minutes.  If you’re concerned about not getting good browning on the bottom crust, start out at the regular temperature for the first 15 minutes or so, then reduce it. If the edge crust is getting too brown before the center of the pie heats through, you can also try creating a ring-shaped heat shield out of aluminum foil, which you can (carefully) place over the edge of the pie.  Use another pie dish as a template.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  Now, I have a new situation: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.  Answer this question please: Which candidate will Mike not vote for?","output":"Based on Mike's concern for the environment and his belief that the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it, he will not vote for Jessica. Jessica's response to the question about the Earth's atmosphere suggested that she thinks emitting more anthropogenic gases would lead to the best outcome for the world. This stance contradicts the need to protect the environment and mitigate the effects of global warming, which involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. Therefore, Mike would likely disagree with Jessica's stance and not vote for her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

Question: The Alps were created by two what meeting? Context: The formation of the Alps (the Alpine orogeny) was an episodic process that began about 300 million years ago. In the Paleozoic Era the Pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate; it broke into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era and the Tethys sea developed between Laurasia and Gondwana during the Jurassic Period. The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the Alpide belt, from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia—a process that began at the end of the Mesozoic and continues into the present.

Answer the following question: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: Why did the author's mother make him shovel the snow from the homes of the elderly? Options:  A. To provide them with some relief from the snow  B. Because she owed them money  C. not enough information  D. Because it was the only work available in the area  === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"A.

When I was writing the manuscript for Florentine, I enlisted the help of an army of recipe testers — about 80 people from all over the world — to test every recipe thoroughly. Only one came back to me consistently with problems. From Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with “dissolved” gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi’s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared – O dove’erano andati? “Where did they go?” In the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors — was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use “proper” ricotta? Aha. “Proper” ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind — to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe. When does the author suggest to used the right type of ricotta?

I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.  But I can use this background: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.  What is an answer for this question: In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Answer:","output":"Sample A would produce ATP molecules, as it has a higher respiration rate which allows for the process of cellular respiration to convert glucose into ATP molecules, providing energy for the organism. Sample B, with no respiration rate, would not be able to carry out cellular respiration effectively and thus would not produce ATP molecules efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  He air we breathe contains oxygen and other gases - Once in the lungs, oxygen is moved into the bloodstream and carried through your body - At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide - Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where it is removed from the blood stream and then exhaled Answer:","output":"The final step of the process described above occurs when the waste gas, carbon dioxide, is expelled from the body through exhalation.  To provide a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the overall process, it can be broken down into several key stages: 1. Inhalation: In the initial phase, air is drawn into the body through the nose and/or mouth. This air contains vital oxygen, along with other gases, which is necessary for our body to create energy. 2. Gas exchange in the lungs: The oxygen-rich air enters the lungs and is carried through a complex network of bronchi, which eventually lead to tiny air sacs called alveoli. The alveoli are surrounded by tiny blood vessels called capillaries that facilitate the efficient exchange of gases between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the capillaries. 3. Oxygen transport: Oxygen in the inhaled air binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells within the capillaries. These oxygenated blood cells are then transported throughout the body by the circulatory system to supply the body's tissues and organs with the oxygen they require. 4. Cellular respiration: At a cellular level, oxygen is utilized to generate energy through a complex biochemical process called cellular respiration. During this process, oxygen reacts with glucose (a simple sugar) to produce usable energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). As a byproduct of this reaction, waste gas in the form of carbon dioxide is produced. 5. Carbon dioxide transport: The carbon dioxide waste gas produced in cellular respiration diffuses out of the cells and into the surrounding capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. The bloodstream then transports these carbon dioxide-laden blood cells back toward the lungs. 6. Gas exchange in the lungs (removal of carbon dioxide): As the blood carrying carbon dioxide reaches the alveoli in the lungs, the waste gas diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli. This process essentially reverses the earlier gas exchange when oxygen was absorbed into the blood, preparing the carbon dioxide to be expelled from the body. 7. Exhalation: The final step of the process occurs when the diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity, relaxes and rises. This action causes the pressure inside the lungs to increase, forcing the carbon dioxide-rich air out of the lungs and expelling it through the nose and mouth. This series of events maintains a continuous cycle of oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide removal, ensuring that our body cells are supplied with the oxygen needed to create energy and sustain life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is Baron von Frankenstein's relationship to Katrin? Movie title: Flesh for Frankenstein Movie plot: Baron von Frankenstein neglects his duties towards his wife/sister Katrin, as he is obsessed with creating a perfect Serbian race to obey his commands, beginning by assembling a perfect male and female from parts of corpses. The doctor's sublimation of his sexual urges by his powerful urge for domination is shown when he utilizes the surgical wounds of his female creation to satisfy his lust. He is dissatisfied with the inadequate reproductive urges of his current male creation, and seeks a head donor with a greater libido; he also repeatedly exhibits an intense interest that the creature's \\"nasum\\" (nose) have a correctly Serbian shape.[6][7] As it happens, a suitably randy farmhand, Nicholas, leaving a local brothel along with his sexually repressed friend, brought there in an unsuccessful attempt to dissuade him from entering a monastery, are spotted and waylaid by the doctor and his henchman, Otto; mistakenly assuming that the prospective monk is also suitable for stud duty, they take his head for use on the male creature. Not knowing these behind-the-scene details, Nicholas survives and is summoned by Katrin to the castle, where they form an agreement that he will gratify her unsatisfied carnal appetites.[6][7] Under the control of the doctor, the male and female creatures are seated for dinner with the castle's residents, but the male creature shows no signs of recognition of his friend as he serves the Baron and his family. Nicholas realizes at this point that something is awry, but himself pretends not to recognize his friend's face until he can investigate further. After a falling-out with Katrin, who is merely concerned with her own needs, Nicholas goes snooping in the laboratory and is captured by the doctor. Frankenstein muses about using his new acquisition to replace the head of his creature, who is still showing no signs of libido. Nevertheless, Katrin is rewarded for betraying Nicholas by being granted use of the creature for erotic purposes, but is killed during a bout of overly vigorous...

But she also had a 20,221.40 credit card bill and an empty bank account. Karyn decided that it was time for a change. She built a website and simply asked people to help her out by sending her a dollar or two. On the site, Karyn honestly explained her situation. \\"If 20,000 people gave me just 1, I'd be home free.\\" Amazingly, it worked. Her website was visited by more than a million people. Although most donors just gave a few dollars, one generous donor sent 1,000. She was on TV and in newspapers and magazines. She was offered a book deal and a movie contract. And of course, she was able to pay off her credit card debt. She also sold her designer clothes on eBay. In her closet, where the Gucci purse once sat, Karyn keeps all the letters that people have sent her.

The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.

Well, guess what? Some people from BBC Pop Up, a group who travels and tells us stories about different countries, went to India! This time, they tried to find out the answer to this cool question. So let's explore and learn together! India is a big country with lots of people and many ways to travel. In Delhi, a huge city in India, there are two popular ways to get around: by autorickshaw or by using Uber, an app where you can ask a driver to pick you up in their car. Autorickshaw, also known as auto, is like a small three-wheeled vehicle that can carry people from one place to another. It's very common on Indian roads, and it is super colorful! Now, back to the fun race. BBC Pop Up decided to see which one was faster: if they called an Uber driver or if they hopped onto an autorickshaw. They wanted to know which one could take people around Delhi quicker. To make it a fair competition, they started the race from the same place and at the same time. They also needed to go to the same destination, so nobody would have an advantage. During the race, the autorickshaw zoomed through the busy streets, weaving in and out of traffic. It was small and could fit into tight spaces that the car couldn't. On the other hand, the Uber car was very comfortable, and the driver could use a GPS to find the fastest route, which is a smart computer thing that shows the best way to go. The people watching the race were very excited and curious to see which one would win. After some time, they finally found the answer: it seemed that the autorickshaw was a little bit faster! Hurray for the autorickshaw! So kids, next time you or your family visit India, you know that taking an autorickshaw might actually be faster than calling an Uber car. Plus, it can be a fun and exciting adventure! Just remember that sometimes, finding the fastest way to get around a city might not always be in a big and fancy car. Sometimes, a small, colorful, and lively vehicle like an autorickshaw can do the trick too!

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

(CNN) -- Iran's Red Crescent Society will try to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza by sending food and medical supplies to the besieged Palestinian territory, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday. Red Crescent official Abdul Rauf Adibzadeh said one shipment of relief goods will arrive in Gaza via Egypt by the end of the week, Iranian media reported. The aid group is also preparing to send two relief ships to the coast of Gaza, including a hospital ship with doctors, nurses and operating rooms and another vessel with more relief goods like food and medication, the IRNA and Mehr news agencies reported. Adibzadeh said there is a possibility that Iranian Red Crescent ships may be attacked but added that, despite the danger, if the Iranian authorities approve, the shipments will be sent to","output":"Gaza. As the Iranian Red Crescent Society makes preparations and arrangements to send aid to Gaza, their efforts are indeed laudable and showcase their commitment to helping those affected by the ongoing crisis in the region. The Israeli blockade of Gaza has significantly impacted access to essential supplies, such as food, medical equipment, and lifesaving medication. In these challenging circumstances, it is important to explore the potential implications and ramifications of Iran's Red Crescent Society's decision to break the Israeli blockade. Firstly, the economic and humanitarian crisis in Gaza is quite dire. With the blockade in place for over a decade, the situation has been exacerbated by restrictions on movement, unemployment, poverty, and the lack of access to basic services such as healthcare, electricity, and clean water. By sending food and medical supplies, the Iranian Red Crescent aims to alleviate some of the hardships faced by civilians in the region. The initial shipment through Egypt will offer much-needed relief in the immediate term, while the two subsequent ships, including a fully equipped hospital and relief vessel, can provide longer-term support and assistance. This mission demonstrates Iran's commitment to helping those in need and also reflects the country's evolving foreign policy objectives. Iran has historically been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause and has often criticized Israel's actions against the Palestinians. By providing aid and assistance to Gaza, Iran is strengthening its position in the region and building relations with groups that consider Israel an adversary. This move might also gain Iran more recognition and support from other countries and organizations sympathetic to the Palestinians or opposing the Israeli blockade. However, there are potential risks and dangers involved in attempting to break the Israeli blockade, which Iran must address. With tensions already high between Israel and Iran, sending ships with Iranian flags to Gaza might be perceived as a provocation by the Israeli government. The Israeli navy has a history of intercepting and even attacking vessels attempting to break the blockade, including the infamous 2010 Mavi Marmara incident that resulted in the deaths of several activists. Additionally, Israel might view Iran's Red Crescent Society's actions as supporting extremist groups based in Gaza, such as Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States, and the European Union. This could potentially further strain the already tense relationship between Israel and Iran and lead to increased hostility between the two countries. It is crucial that Iran's Red Crescent Society, along with relevant international organizations, works towards ensuring the safety and well-being of those involved in the aid mission. This includes conducting ongoing security assessments, coordinating closely with Egyptian authorities during the initial shipment's transit through Egypt, and engaging in diplomatic efforts to facilitate the safe passage of the relief ships to Gaza. Furthermore, maintaining transparency about the contents of the shipments and the motive behind this mission can help mitigate allegations of hidden agendas and lessen the chances of a military confrontation at sea. In conclusion, the efforts of Iran's Red Crescent Society to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza and provide essential food and medical supplies are commendable, but they must be weighed against the potential risks involved. It is imperative that Iran, Israel, and other regional stakeholders engage in dialogue and diplomacy to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and prevent any escalation of tensions that could exacerbate an already fragile situation. Ultimately, it is the people of Gaza who stand to benefit or bear the consequences of these actions, and it remains the responsibility of all parties involved to prioritize their well-being and safety."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: We know the westerners like to plan for their time carefully in order to do all the things that are important to them. So if your American or English friend asks you to dinner, he usually invites you a week ahead. But if you really have no time and can't go to the dinner, you can ring him to say sorry. The dinner is usually served at home, sometimes at a restaurant. You should get there on time, and don't forget to put on your fine clothes. It is also a good idea to take some little presents to your friend, such as flowers, chocolates and so on. When you are at dinner, you should also observe   some other customs. Here I'll give you some dos and don'ts about them in the following: 1) Don't leave bones on the table or the floor. (You should put them on your plate with fingers.) 2) Don't use your bowl to drink soup, but use your spoon to help you instead. 3) Don't talk with much food in your mouth. 4) Don't ask others to have more wine. (This is quite different from that in China.) 5) After dinner, use your napkin   to clean your mouth and hands. 6) Make sure small pieces of food are not left on your face. Then after dinner, you can stay there a little time. And your friend will be pleased if you leave in half an hour or so. Next day, you had better ring him up to thank him for the good dinner.

Summarize this article: Discovering you have an unborn twin living inside of you sounds like the stuff of horror movies and nightmares. In fact, having a “parasitic twin” is the plot of Stephen King’s novel \\"The Dark Half\\" and an episode of \\"The X-Files.\\" But for one teenage boy in Malaysia, this isn’t a part of a fictional plot, this his reality.      Mohd Zul Shahril Saidin, 15, was hospitalized for the last four months after he complained of stomach pain. It turned out the teen had been carrying his unborn twin inside him for 15 years, and he recently underwent surgery to remove the mass in what may be the first case of its kind in Malaysia, Fox News reported.      “The fetus removed from my son's stomach was formed with organs like those of a baby -- only the nose and mouth were not complete,” said Hasmah Ahmad, the teen’s mother, according to The Mirror. This included an almost complete genitalia and hair.      A teenage boy in Malaysia underwent surgery to have his unborn twin removed after 15 years. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images      This condition, known as \\"fetus in fetu,\\" is rare, occurring about once in every 500,000 births. It was first described by German anatomist Johann Friedrich Meckel in the late 18th century and is characterized as having the presence of one of the twins in the body of the other. It's usually located in the retroperitoneal area — or the space between the membrane lining the cavity of the abdomen and the posterior abdominal wall.      Some scientists have speculated this condition is a result of a teratoma,which is a tumor that may contain several types of body tissue, including muscle, teeth, and bone. However, Meckel has determined that the fetus in fetu condition is the result of an underdeveloped twin. The difference between a fetus in fetu and teratoma is that a fetus in fetu displays “evidence of body plan organization, such as having vertebrae, limb buds, or organ tissue,” Medical Daily previously reported.      Saidin, who is the fifth of eight children, had an “oddly rounded shape tummy” since he was a year old, Malaysian Digest reported. However, it didn’t adversely affect him physically until he reached secondary school. His movements became more restricted due to his growing, protruding stomach. He was taken to the doctor once he started complaining of intense stomach pains. The teen and his family held a funeral for the fetus, and buried the remains in a cemetery.      The last recorded case of fetus in fetu occurred in 2015, when a 45-year-old woman discovered that a 10-centimeter mass growing on her left ovary was her unborn twin. Similar to Saidin’s case, the mass also looked like an underdeveloped human with a partially formed face, an eye, a tooth, and long black hair. ||||| Since birth, a teenage boy in Malaysia has carried around the unborn fetus of his twin. Recently, the teen successfully underwent surgery to remove the mass, which is believed to be the first such case in the country, Central European News (CEN) reported.      Mohd Zul Shahril Saidin, 15, is the fifth of eight children and a native of the town of Baling. He was only hospitalized within the last four months after complaining of pain, CEN reported.      After the surgery, reports suggest the fetus had hair, legs, hands and genitals.      “The fetus removed from my son’s stomach was formed with organs like those of a baby— only the nose and mouth were not complete,” Hasmah Ahmad, the teen’s mother, told CEN.      The condition is known as “fetus in fetu,” a rare congenital anomaly in which a malformed and parasitic fetus is located in the body of its twin, according to the National Institutes of Health. The mass resided in Saidin’s abdomen. The phenomenon occurs in 1 in every 500,000 live births, CEN reported.      The family has performed funeral rites on the fetus, which has been buried in a cemetery. ||||| Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

Reports said Mohd Zul Shahril, the fifth of eight children and a native of the town of Baling in Kedah, was only hospitalised recently after he began complaining of pain in the last four months.

It is estimated that the phenomenon occurs in 1 in every 500,000 live births. ||||| A teenage boy from Sungai Petani, Kedah has made history after a parasitic twin was found living in his tummy in what could be the first case of its kind in Malaysia.      Sinar Harian reported that the boy, who prefers to only be known as Shahril underwent a surgery recently to remove the ‘mass’ from his body following persistent stomach aches and the worsening condition of his unusually rounded tummy.      Doctors were shocked when a ‘creature’- a mass of tissue with lengthy hair, partially formed limbs and almost complete genitalia instead emerged from the young teen’s body.      The rare condition is scientifically known as “foetus-in-fetu,” which occurs when one half of a twin forms in the body of the other, making this by far the first of its kind to be reported in Malaysia and only a handful of cases have been reported around the world.      That parasitic twin has since been safely removed out of the 15-year-old who had a history of seeking medical attention since he was a year old for his oddly rounded shape tummy.      Sharil has been an active child growing up, playing football and other sports like any other young boys his age without facing any complications.      He also displayed a big appetite and at one point remarked, “I have to feed the baby in my stomach,” while downing food in large quantities.      However, his physical movements became more restricted once he entered secondary school due to his ever growing protruding stomach, which has also made him became self-conscious of his appearance.      After complaining of intense stomach pain last month he was eventually taken to the hospital where doctors finally caught on to the cause for his pain.      Foetus-in-fetu is said to only occur in only 1 out of 500,000 births. The last recorded case of the condition was of a 36-year-old man in India back in 1999.      - mD |||||","output":"There was once a teenage boy in Malaysia who had a very strange tummy.

Hace 3 meses - Chicago, Hombre How do you say this sentence in English?","output":"The sentence \\"Hace 3 meses - Chicago, Hombre\\" in Spanish would be translated into English as \\"3 months ago - Chicago, Male\\".  To break it down: 1. \\"Hace 3 meses\\" is Spanish for \\"3 months ago\\". In Spanish, \\"hace\\" is used to express the amount of time that has passed since an event occurred. This is different from English where we would typically put \\"ago\\" after the time phrase. For example, the English equivalent \\"3 months ago\\" has \\"ago\\" at the end, not the start.  2. \\"Chicago\\" remains the same in both languages as it is a proper noun, the name of a city in the United States. Importantly, in Spanish, the name of the cities, countries and other geographic names are pronounced in a way that is as close as possible to the language these belong to.  3. \\"Hombre\\" translates to \\"Male\\" in English. This is a category often used when sorting data or specifying personal information such as gender.  Therefore, if this phrase was being used to label some data, perhaps on a demographic survey or a user profile, it would indicate that the information relates to a male individual who lived in Chicago 3 months ago or that the information was from 3 months ago from a male in Chicago.

It didn't take long to find them. As the Royal Navy ship lowered her landing craft to begin rescuing the first three boats filled with migrants, reports were coming in of more on route from Libya. The first boat we saw illustrated their desperation to reach Europe. A small wooden vessel was packed with around 400 people. There was barely any room to move on deck. Below, another load of migrants had been loaded like cargo. They were drifting without an engine, just hoping for salvation. It would have needed a miracle for that boat to complete the journey to Europe. Nearby Bulwark's crew were also coming to the rescue of two perilous rubber dinghies, each carrying around a hundred more people. The fact that many didn't even have life jackets was another reminder that the gangs who trafficked them had little regard for their lives. In Bulwark's docking bay we watched wave after wave of landing craft arrive, each full with another load of people. The injured were among the first to be offloaded. We watched as a women was stretchered off - she was pregnant and suffering from dehydration. For most their only belongings were the clothes they were wearing. They were marshalled to an area to be processed. First they were searched to ensure none was carrying any weapons. Then they were asked to give their names and the countries they came from. They had travelled from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and sub-Saharan Africa. There were Syrians who had fled one civil war only to find another in Libya. After they had been given some food and water, we spoke to them about their journey. They told us that they had paid around 1,000 (Â£650) to the gangs who had smuggled them. Many had come to Libya to find work but as the country descended into chaos they found they were the victims of discrimination. Tor, a Christian man from South Sudan, said he'd been victimised because he didn't have a Muslim name. He broke down in tears when I asked him about the family he had left behind.  He claimed as well that some of the people involved in the smuggling had also been rescued. Moussa from Ghana, who was just 17, said he had been beaten by the people who trafficked him. Whatever the reasons that had taken them to Libya, they all agreed that it was now too dangerous to stay.  They were making the journey to Europe because they thought it was their only hope. Esaw, another man from Ghana, told me that he wasn't even expecting to survive the journey. By the end of the day Bulwark and her crew had taken on board 1,200 people with the ship declared in \\"overload\\" conditions. Some survivors were taken onto the upper open decks, because there wasn't enough room below to accommodate them. In the words of Bulwark's captain this \\"may well be the tip of the iceberg\\". This is supported by some estimates that say there are already half a million people waiting to make the same journey. The captain can't be sure they picked up everyone at sea on this day. All he can say is that Bulwark and her crew have done all they can to bring as many as possible to safety. The Royal Navy ship is now on her way to Sicily to hand the migrants over to the Italian authorities. But soon Bulwark will set sail again to look for the next wave coming in.

Percy Tyrone Sledge (November 25, 1940 - April 14, 2015) was an American R&B, soul and gospel singer. He is best known for the song \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\", a No. 1 hit on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B singles charts in 1966. It was awarded a million-selling, Gold-certified disc from the RIAA. Having previously worked as a hospital orderly in the early 1960s, Sledge achieved his strongest success in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a series of emotional soul songs. Sledge's career enjoyed a renaissance in the 1980s when \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" re-entered the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 2 behind the reissued Ben E. King classic \\"Stand by Me\\", after being used in a Levi's commercial. In the early 1990s, Michael Bolton brought \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\" back into the limelight again on his hit album Time, Love, & Tenderness. On the week of November 17 to November 23, 1991, Bolton's version also hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, exactly 25 1/2  years to the week after Percy's did in 1966.  In 1994, Saul Davis and Barry Goldberg produced Sledge's album, Blue Night, for Philippe Le Bras' Sky Ranch label and Virgin Records. It featured Bobby Womack, Steve Cropper, and Mick Taylor among others. Blue Night received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Blues Album, Vocal or Instrumental, and in 1996 it won the W.C. Handy Award for best soul or blues album.  In 2004, Davis and Goldberg also produced the Shining Through the Rain album, which preceded his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Songs on the CD were written by Mikael Rickfors, Steve Earle, the Bee Gees, Carla Olson, Denny Freeman, Allan Clarke and Jackie Lomax. The same year Percy recorded a live album with his band Sunset Drive entitled Percy Sledge and Sunset Drive - Live in Virginia on WRM Records produced by Warren Rodgers.  In May 2007, Percy was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame in his home city of Baton Rouge, LA.  In December 2010, Rhino Handmade issued a four-CD retrospective, The Atlantic Recordings, which covers all of the issued Atlantic masters, as well as many of the tracks unissued in the United States (although some were simply the mono versions of songs originally issued in stereo; Disc 1 comprises Sledge's first two LPs which were not recorded on stereo equipment).

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: Bob is a financial analyst. He used to work for company A. Bob noticed that company A is mostly financed by debt. Recently, he changed job and now working as a financial analyst for another company, company B. Company B has completely different culture than company A. Company B is mostly financed by equity.  But I can use this background: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.  What is an answer for this question: Would company B have or not have tax benefits of debt?","output":"Company B, which is mostly financed by equity, would not have as much tax benefits of debt compared to a company that is mostly financed by debt, like Company A. The tax benefits of debt come from the fact that interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, which reduces a company's taxable income. Since Company B has a lower amount of debt in its capital structure, the tax benefits it receives from debt would be smaller compared to a company with a higher proportion of debt financing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: Home Office Survey Reveals Decline in Police Visibility Despite PCSO Initiation Introduction In a recent Home Office survey involving 50,000 participants, it was revealed that only 14 per cent of the respondents claimed to see police officers on a daily basis. This comes as a cause for concern, considering the introduction of the Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) scheme, known as 'Blunkett bobbies,' which aimed to boost police visibility on the streets. This article explores the factors underlying this development and its potential implications for public safety as well as trust in law enforcement agencies. Background: The Introduction of PCSOs In the early 2000s, the British government introduced the PCSO initiative, also known as 'Blunkett bobbies,' named after David Blunkett, the then Home Secretary. The main goal of this scheme was to enhance police visibility and presence within neighborhoods across the country, thereby promoting public safety and fostering trust between the police and the communities they serve. Over the years, thousands of PCSOs have been employed to work alongside traditional police officers in various jurisdictions. The Home Office Survey Findings According to the recent study commissioned by the Home Office, only a fraction of respondents (14%) reported seeing police officers on a daily basis. Considering the goals of the PCSO initiative, these findings have raised multiple questions and concerns among citizens and law enforcement agencies. Several factors might have contributed to this decline in police visibility. The most obvious one is the significant reduction in the overall number of frontline police officers across the country in the past decade. This decline has put pressure on the remaining officers, forcing them to focus on attending to more critical incidents and investigations, leaving less time for regular patrols or public engagement. Another factor affecting police visibility might be the shift in policing strategies in recent years with the emergence of new technologies. Many law enforcement agencies are adopting data-driven and intelligence-led policing models, which focus on identifying and addressing the root causes of criminal activities. This approach might limit the physical presence of officers on the streets since they spend more time analyzing information and identifying trends. Implications of Reduced Police Visibility Decreased visibility of police officers has multiple consequences for both the public and the law enforcement agencies. Firstly, it can negatively impact the community's perception of police effectiveness and trust in their ability to maintain public safety. A diminishing police presence on the streets might create the impression that crime levels are on the rise, increasing fear among citizens, and potentially leading to a decline in public confidence in the police department. Secondly, reduced police visibility might hamper the flow of information from the public to the police. When officers are regularly seen walking the beat or patrolling neighborhoods in their vehicles, community members are more likely to approach them with useful information, which can be vital in preventing or solving crimes. This interaction between the police and the public can be an invaluable tool that might be hindered by decreased police presence. Conclusion The findings of the Home Office survey point out an alarming reduction in police visibility, despite the implementation of the PCSO initiative. This development calls for a critical evaluation of the policing strategies and resource allocation to ensure that communities continue to benefit from an accessible, present, and effective police force. Law enforcement agencies should explore innovative ways to maintain and enhance their visibility through the use of technology, such as deploying CCTV cameras, utilizing social media to engage with the public, and investing in community policing programs that build trust and collaboration. These efforts will be crucial to restoring public confidence and ensuring safety in our neighborhoods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: -  Rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth - The rain falls on the soil over the limestone - The carbon dioxide in the rain washes through the soil - The carbon dioxide turns into acid - The acid in the rain gets to the limestone below the soil - The acid dissolves the limestone - Acid continues to erode the limestone with more rain over time - The eroded limestone sometimes forms caves.  What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","output":"The first step of the process is the rain picking up carbon dioxide as it falls to earth. When rain forms in the atmosphere, it interacts with various gases, including carbon dioxide. In this interaction, carbon dioxide gets dissolved in the rainwater and forms a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3). This weak acid is what gives the rain its mildly acidic nature. Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, and its concentration has been significantly increasing due to various human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Consequently, the amount of carbon dioxide being dissolved in the rainwater has also increased, leading to a mild increase in the acidity of rain. This phenomenon, commonly known as \\"acid rain,\\" has various environmental implications, including the weathering and erosion of limestone rocks. As rainwater carrying dissolved carbon dioxide makes its way through soil and reaches the underlying limestone rock, the dissolved carbonic acid reacts with calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is the primary mineral constituent of limestone. This reaction results in the dissolution and subsequent erosion of the limestone rock. Over time, the continuous erosion of limestone by acid rain leads to the formation of various geological features, such as caves, sinkholes, and underground drainage systems. In conclusion, the first step in the process of limestone erosion due to acid rain is the formation of carbonic acid in rainwater, which occurs when rain picks up carbon dioxide as it falls to the earth. This weak acid then initiates the chain of events leading to the erosion of limestone rocks and the eventual formation of caves and other unique geological features."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: the brain is what Context: The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.

PUBLISHED:. 17:28 EST, 1 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 07:57 EST, 2 November 2013. A pet rabbit has apparently become the latest victim of false widow spiders. Only hours earlier one-year-old Molly had been hopping happily around the garden. But she was found dead in her hutch after it was infested by the  poisonous creatures. Recently false widow spiders have put several people in hospital after biting them and even caused a school to be closed temporarily. Victim: The body of the pet rabbit, called Molly, was found next to a spider's web with five false widows crawling around. Molly’s owner Samantha Davies found her dead when she went to feed her two rabbits, Molly and Milly. When the 21-year-old removed Molly’s body, she found a hammock-shaped web and up to five spiders scuttling around the hutch. After using the internet to identify them as false widows, Miss Davies became worried for the safety of her 18-month-old daughter, Rosie. She contacted her local environmental health department in the hope of having her home treated for infestation. Her request was declined, but  an officer told her he was 98 per cent certain the spider was responsible for Molly’s death. Yesterday Miss Davies, a kitchen assistant, said: ‘We couldn’t believe it when we saw the spiders. I was really upset when Molly died. Devastated: Samantha Davies, 21, pictured with her 18-month-old daughter Rosie and partner Scott Barnes, was told by an environmental health officer he was 98 per cent certain the pet's death was caused by the spiders. ‘I really didn’t want the spiders around my daughter. We asked environmental health if they could help us, but they refused. ‘If it had been a rat, they would have done something, but not with poisonous spiders.’ Miss Davies, who lives with her partner Scott Barnes and their daughter in Mountain Ash, South Wales, has since disinfected the hutch where Milly still lives, and killed the spiders she found last weekend. Venomous: The false widow spider has caused a school to be closed and has left people with horrific injuries after the attack in recent weeks. The false widow is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known to be in Britain and cases of people being bitten by the venomous creature have been on the rise. John Catlin, 66, from Bromley, Kent, is still recovering a year after a bite that caused his organs to start shutting down. Bodybuilder Gary Meadows from Teesville, Middlesbrough, required a skin graft when he was bitten in 2011 and has suffered severe reactions to any insect bite since. Layla Benton, 14, was off school  for three weeks after her knee swelled up when she was bitten in her bathroom in Basildon, Essex. And last month Dean Academy in Lydney, Gloucestershire, had to close its doors to pupils after the dangerous spiders were found there. The spiders are shiny and black with distinctive cream markings on the abdomen that resemble a horseshoe – or, to some eyes, a skull. They have long, spindly legs and  are easily confused with the black widow, a far more venomous cousin not found in Britain. As with most species of spider, it is the female false widow which is the force to be reckoned with. Males tend not to grow much bigger than two centimetres, while females reach up to three centimetres. The first false widow is thought to have come to Britain  from the Canary Islands or Madeira in the 1870s in a bunch of bananas. The first recorded sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879.

Write a summary based on this article: KUALA LUMPUR/WASHINGTON The FBI is helping Malaysian authorities to analyze data from a flight simulator belonging to the captain of a missing Malaysian airliner, a U.S. official said on Wednesday as investigators grasped for clues 12 days after the plane vanished.      Malaysia's police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, said an examination of the simulator, taken from the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, showed its data log had been cleared on February 3, more than a month before the airliner, carrying 239 people, disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.      \\"The experts are looking at what are the logs that have been cleared,\\" he told a news conference.      No wreckage has been found from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8 (1721 GMT March 7), less than an hour after taking off.      Malaysia has now made available to the FBI electronic data generated by both pilots of Flight MH370, including data from a hard drive attached to the captain's flight simulator, and from electronic media used by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters.      The official said he could not confirm that some data had been wiped from the simulator and stressed that there was no guarantee the FBI analysis would turn up any fresh clues.      U.S. investigators had become increasingly frustrated in recent days that Malaysian authorities had not asked them for more help.      The FBI has extensive experience investigating airplane crashes, including those of TWA 800 and EgyptAir 990 off the U.S. east coast in the 1990s and Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.      In the case of EgyptAir 990, the FBI helped air safety investigators establish that the crash was caused by a suicidal co-pilot, while in the case of Pan Am 103, the agency worked with British and U.S. intelligence to build a case against the government of Libya.      In Kuala Lumpur, at the headquarters of a search operation that has so far turned up few leads, Chinese relatives' anger over sparse information on the fate of their relatives sparked chaotic scenes on Wednesday.      Malaysia's transport minister ordered an inquiry after security guards carried out the distraught mother of a passenger from a briefing room where she had protested about a lack of transparency.      \\"They are just saying wait for information. Wait for information. We don't know how long we have to wait,\\" cried the woman before being whisked away from a massive media scrum.      Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he regretted the anguish.      \\"Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing,\\" he said in a statement.      DWINDLING HOPES      Prospects that a 26-nation operation would lead to quick results appeared to be dwindling, however, as investigators confirmed they were focusing on the remote southern Indian Ocean after failing to find any traces of the jet further north.      \\"Our top priority is being given to that area,\\" Hishammuddin told the news conference, confirming an earlier Reuters report.      Australia is leading the search in the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy.      It has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but it still covers an area of 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles), roughly the size of Spain and Portugal.      The unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER had focused on two vast search corridors: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia's Sumatra island to west of Australia.      \\"The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,\\" said a source close to the investigation.      That view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor.      Some sources involved in the investigation have voiced fears it could stall due to the reluctance of countries in the region to share militarily sensitive radar data that might shed new light on the direction the jet took.      Two people familiar with the investigation said the search had been hampered in some cases by delays over the paperwork needed to allow foreign maritime surveillance aircraft into territorial waters without a formal diplomatic request.      \\"These are basically spy planes; that's what they were designed for,\\" said one source close to the investigation, explaining the hesitance of some nations to give blanket permission for other countries to scour their waters.      Hishammuddin confirmed that some assets that could be involved in the search were waiting for diplomatic clearance.      \\"The search for MH370 involves diplomatic, technical and logistical challenges,\\" he told the news conference, held in a Kuala Lumpur airport hotel that has served as a temporary crisis coordination centre and a base for dozens of news organizations.      DELIBERATELY DIVERTED      Malaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why.      If the plane did indeed end up in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the remotest places on Earth and also one of the deepest seas, it increases the chance it may never be found - and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board.      Officials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital datalinks: the ACARS system, which relays maintenance data back to the ground, and the transponder, which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar.      U.S. agencies have looked for evidence that anyone other than the pilots knew how disable ACARS but have found nothing.

Marks, the spokesman for the United States Navy Seventh Fleet, which has helped oversee the American military contribution to the search for the missing plane, said in a brief email on Thursday that he had not heard word of finding any objects possibly from the aircraft.      On Wednesday, Commander Marks said, “If suspect debris were spotted, the aircraft would more than likely use the EO/IR camera at close range to identify exactly what was detected.” He was referring to a camera with electro-optical and infrared functions that can discern objects much more sharply than a naked human eye. The aircraft, he added, “could provide the necessary information to lead salvage ships to the wreckage.”      Photo      As the possible break in what had been a fruitless search was being pursued, the Malaysian authorities were seeking help from the F.B.I. to help retrieve deleted computer data from a homemade flight simulator belonging to the captain of the Malaysia Airlines jet that vanished 11 days ago, their first request for high-level American assistance in solving the mystery of the missing plane.      Malaysian and American investigators are homing in on the pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and his first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, though they have not excluded different possibilities.

Video      “Right now, it’s the best chance we have of finding something,” the law enforcement official said. Unless the pilot used very sophisticated technology to erase files, he added, the F.B.I. will most likely be able to recover them.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story      As the geographic scope of the search has widened, Australia as well as China, India, France, the United States and other nations have offered naval ships, surveillance planes, satellites and experts to Malaysia, which is leading the effort. The investigators face a formidable set of mechanical, avionic and satellite communication puzzles.      Flight 370 was about 40 minutes into a six-hour trip to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, early on March 8 when it suddenly stopped communicating with air traffic controllers and turned far off course, cutting back across peninsular Malaysia, over the Strait of Malacca and toward the Indian Ocean. Military radar tracked it for a while, but the operators did not seek to identify the plane or alert anyone. A satellite over the ocean picked up automated signals for several more hours — facts not released publicly for days after the plane vanished.      Tracking Flight 370 The sequence of events known by the authorities, in local times. Mar. 8, 2014 00:41 AM A Boeing 777-200 operated by Malaysia Airlines leaves Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing with 227 passengers, of which two-thirds are Chinese, and a Malaysian crew of 12. Mar. 8, 2014 01:07 AM The airplane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or Acars, which transmits data about the plane's performance, sends a transmission. It is not due to transmit again for a half-hour. Mar. 8, 2014 01:19 AM The cockpit crew acknowledges a message from ground control, saying, \\"Good night Malaysian three seven zero.\\" No further voice messages are received from the plane. Mar. 8, 2014 01:21 AM Two minutes after the last voice transmission, the plane's transponder, which signals its identity, altitude and speed to other aircraft and to monitors on the ground, is shut off or fails. Detecting a Plane Mar. 8, 2014 01:37 AM The Acars system fails to send its scheduled signal, indicating that it has been shut off or has failed sometime in the past half-hour. Mar. 8, 2014 02:15 AM An unidentified plane flying westward is detected by military radar. It ascends to 45,000 feet, above the approved limit for a Boeing 777, then descends unevenly to 23,000 feet and eventually flies out over the Indian Ocean. Investigators later conclude that it was Flight 370. It was last plotted 200 miles northwest of Panang. Q. and A. Mar. 8, 2014 06:30 AM By now Flight 370 was scheduled to have landed in Beijing. Mar. 8, 2014 07:24 AM Malaysia Airlines announces that it has lost contact with the aircraft. Mar. 8, 2014 08:11 AM The last complete signal is received from an automated satellite system on the plane, suggesting that it was still intact and flying. The Malaysian authorities say the jet had enough fuel to keep flying for perhaps a half-hour after this. Search Area Expanded Mar. 8, 2014 08:19 AM Inmarsat, a satellite communications company, says an incomplete signal representing a “partial handshake\\" may have been received.            Further analysis of satellite data confirms that the jet went down in the southern Indian Ocean. Mar. 15, 2014 00:00 AM The Malaysian authorities say the investigation has become a criminal matter because the jet appears to have been deliberately diverted. The plane's first turn off course, to the west, was executed using an onboard computer, probably programmed by someone with knowledge of aircraft systems.            The authorities say two passengers were Iranians who boarded using stolen European passports, but no links to terrorist groups are found.      The satellite “pings” led investigators to conclude that the plane had made its way to some point along one of two long, arcing corridors that together embrace 2.24 million square nautical miles of sea and land.

In the same hotel meeting room where Malaysian officials have tried each day to maintain a tone of calm resolve while briefing reporters, several protesters unfurled a banner that read: “We oppose the Malaysian government concealing the truth. Delaying time for saving lives.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “All our feelings are the same: We demand to know the truth,” said Xu Dengwang, one of the protesters. Security guards soon ejected them from the room.

The Malaysian police, who found that Mr. Zaharie had built a flight simulator at his home, said Wednesday that some data had been erased from the simulator on Feb. 3, more than a month before the ill-fated flight.      Evidence suggests that whoever diverted the plane knew how to disable its communications systems and program course changes, and the data recorded in the pilot’s flight simulator may shed light on whether he was involved. But building and using flight simulators at home is a popular hobby among aviation enthusiasts, and the deletion of data from Mr. Zaharie’s simulator may have been routine housekeeping. Mr. Zaharie did not keep his simulator a secret: He posted a video on YouTube more than a year ago showing him sitting in front of it.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The computer search could reveal impulses or plans linked to the plane’s disappearance. But the investigators could also conclude that Mr. Zaharie deleted files just as the average person does to clean out a computer. ||||| Story highlights Australian Prime Minister says two objects are seen in the southern Indian Ocean      An Australian air force plane is attempting a closer inspection, Australian media report      President Barack Obama says search for Flight 370 is ''a top priority''      No information of significance has so far been found on any passengers, authorities say      Authorities have spotted two objects in the Indian Ocean that are possibly related to the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Thursday.      \\"New and credible information has come to light in relation to the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean,\\" Abbott said in the the Australian House of Representatives in Canberra. \\"The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has received information based on satellite imagery of objects possibly related to the search.      \\"Following specialist analysis of this satellite imagery, two possible objects related to the search have been identified,\\" he said. \\"I can inform the House that a Royal Australian Air Force Orion has been diverted to attempt to locate the objects.\\"      Three other planes will carry out a \\"more intensive follow-up search,\\" he said.      Australian search teams have been at the forefront of the hunt for the missing plane in the remote southern Indian Ocean.      The announcement from Abbott raises hopes of finding parts of the plane after a huge search that is now in its 13th day. Previous reports of debris found in the sea have not turned out to be related to the passenger jet, which vanished over Southeast Asia earlier this month.      But those reports came before the search area was massively expanded into two large arcs, one that heads northwest into Asia, the other southwest into the Indian Ocean.      The Malaysian military is checking the new information from Australian authorities, a source close to the investigation told CNN.      \\"Verification might take some time. It is very far and it will take some time to locate and verify the objects,\\" the source said.      Malaysia's Acting Transportation Secretary Hishammuddin Hussein said Abbott had informed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak of the development Thursday.      \\"At this stage, Australian officials have yet to establish whether these objects are indeed related to the search for MH370,\\" Hishammuddin said.      Other pieces of information related to the investigation into the plane's disappearance had emerged Wednesday.      Flight simulator probed      Investigators looking at the flight simulator taken from the home of Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of the plane, have discovered that some data had been deleted from it, Hishammuddin said at a news conference.      What the revelation means is unclear. It could be another dead end in an investigation that has been full of them so far, or it could provide further evidence for the theory that one or more of the flight crew may have been involved in the plane's disappearance 12 days ago.      \\"It may not tell us anything. It's a step in the process,\\" one U.S. law enforcement source told CNN. \\"It could be a very insignificant detail in the process.\\"      Investigators have been looking into the background of all 239 passengers and crew members aboard the plane that vanished in the early morning hours of March 8 while en route from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.      Particular attention has focused on the pilot and first officer on Flight 370, but authorities have yet to come up with any evidence explaining why either of them would have taken the jetliner off course.      Hishammuddin didn't say what had been deleted, but simulation programs can store data from previous sessions for later playback. He also did not say who might have deleted the data.      FBI examination      Specialists are examining the simulator in hopes of recovering the data that was deleted, Hishammuddin said.

Hide Caption 43 of 43      Among them are experts at the FBI's forensics lab in Quantico, Virginia, who are examining a copy of the simulator's hard drive, as well as a copy of the hard drive from the computer of co-pilot Fariq Ab Hamid, law enforcement sources told CNN.      The FBI examination of the computer drives involves sorting through a large volume of data, according to a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation.      \\"It is going to take some period of time, but we are analyzing it with a great degree of urgency. It is prioritized right at the top because the world is trying to figure this out,\\" the official said on condition of anonymity.      Deleted files from Shah's simulator could reveal it had been used to practice diverting the plane and flying it to an unfamiliar airport, experts said. But even if investigators retrieve past simulations showing that Zaharie practiced flying to seemingly odd locations, that doesn't necessarily indicate evidence of anything nefarious, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation.      \\"You put in strange airports and try to land there, just to see if you can do it,\\" said Schiavo, adding that she sometimes does just that on the flight simulation program on her home computer.      'Grasping at straws'      President Barack Obama called the search for Flight 370 \\"a top priority,\\" telling KDFW of Dallas on Wednesday that the United States will keep working on it.      \\"We have put every resource that we have available at the disposal of the search process,\\" he said.      But beyond help with the computer drives, the Malaysian government has not put in a formal request for additional FBI help overseas, according to the senior U.S. official.      \\"We have made it clear we are ready to provide help whenever they need it,\\" the official said. \\"We are grasping at straws. No one is running on anything white hot.\\"      More than 60 ships and 50 aircraft are participating in the search. But at least two aircraft, a Japanese search plane and a U.S. Navy P-3 Orion, sat on a runway at a Subang air base this week after Indonesia refused to allow the planes to fly through its airspace.      \\"From what I understand, this is an international operation,\\" Cmdr. William Marks, spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet, told CNN by telephone. \\"...I'm confident we're going to be flying today or very soon.\\"      Later, Indonesia's military spokesman told CNN clearance was given to all search planes.      Although the search area spans nearly 3 million square miles, a U.S. government official familiar with the investigation said the missing plane is most likely somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean.      \\"This is an area out of normal shipping lanes, out of any commercial flight patterns, with few fishing boats, and there are no islands,\\" the official said, warning that the search could well last \\"weeks and not days.\\"      Angry families want answers      The lack of progress has angered and frustrated families, who have accused Malaysian officials of withholding information.      Some family members staged a protest at the Kuala Lumpur hotel where media covering the search are staying. Their efforts were cut short by security guards who removed them through a crush of reporters, dragging one as she screamed.

They gather daily for a briefing with officials.      Ye Lun, whose brother-in-law is on the missing plane, says every day is the same. He and his group leave the hotel in the morning for a daily briefing, and that's it. They go back to the hotel to watch the news on television.      In a statement, Hishammuddin said Malaysian authorities \\"regret the scenes at this afternoon's press conference.\\"      \\"One can only imagine the anguish they are going through,\\" he said of the families. \\"Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing.\\"      An abrupt change in direction      The disappearance continues to intrigue the public and frustrate officials, who have turned up no sign of the plane despite the involvement of teams from 26 nations.      On Tuesday, a law enforcement official told CNN that the aircraft's first major change of course -- an abrupt westward turn that took the plane off its route to China and back across the Malay Peninsula -- was almost certainly programmed by somebody in the cockpit.      The change was entered into the plane's system at least 12 minutes before a person in the cockpit, believed to be the co-pilot, signed off to air traffic controllers. Two minutes after the signoff, the plane's transponder stopped communicating details about the plane's altitude, speed and heading.      Some experts said the change in direction could have been part of an alternate flight plan programmed in advance in case of emergency; others suggested it could show something more nefarious was afoot.      But Hishammuddin said Wednesday that \\"there is no additional waypoint on MH370's documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way to Beijing.\\"      The Thai military, meanwhile, said it had spotted the plane turning west toward the Strait of Malacca early on March 8. That supports the analysis of Malaysian military radar that has the plane flying out over the Strait of Malacca and into the Indian Ocean.      But it didn't make it any clearer where the plane went next. Authorities say information from satellites suggests the plane kept flying for about six hours after it was last detected by Malaysian military radar.      Malaysian authorities, who are coordinating the search, say the available evidence suggests the missing plane flew off course in a deliberate act by someone who knew what they were doing.

They've received background checks for all passengers on board, with the exception of those from Russia and Ukraine, Hishammuddin said.      So far, no information of significance has been found about any passengers, Hishammuddin said.      China says it has found nothing suspicious during background checks on its citizens on the flight -- a large majority of the plane's passengers.      And some experts have warned against hastily jumping to conclusions about the role of the pilots.      \\"I've worked on many cases were the pilots were suspect, and it turned out to be a mechanical and horrible problem,\\" said Schiavo. \\"And I have a saying myself: Sometimes, an erratic flight path is heroism, not terrorism.\\"      Ticking clock      Searchers are racing the clock in their efforts to find the plane and its flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders. The devices have batteries designed to send out pings for 30 days. That leaves 18 days until the batteries are expected to run out.      The task is being complicated by the scope of the search area, as well as the depth of some of the waters being searched -- up to 23,000 feet (7,000 meters).      Searchers trying to find and retrieve wreckage and bodies from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, had to use unmanned submarines.      It took nearly two years to find the bulk of the wreckage, including the flight data recorders, in waters nearly 12,000 feet deep. It took even longer to determine what happened to the plane. ||||| Summary:","output":"An extensive investigation into the missing Malaysian airliner, flight MH370, is ongoing.

The review contains negative words and phrases like \\"lame\\", \\"mediocre\\", \\"boring cast\\", \\"stereotypical crap\\", and \\"self-righteous\\". This indicates that the reviewer is not giving a positive opinion on the sitcom. Step 2: List reasons for the sentiment. The reviewer states that the sitcom is:  1. Boring: The cast is not engaging and it uses stereotypical characters and situations. 2. Mediocre: It doesn't provide any unique or interesting content. 3. Self-righteous: The sitcom may try to push various morals in a patronizing way. Step 3: Determine any positive aspects. Amanda Bynes is mentioned to be \\"okej\\" in her perky way, indicating that she might be the only positive aspect in the show according to the reviewer. Step 4: Summarize the review. The review is negative toward the sitcom, mainly for its lack of originality and engaging plotlines, as well as its overuse of stereotypes.

At first, when nobody knows him in New York, he is comfortable wearing his old coat. He believes that since nobody knows him, it doesn't matter what he wears. However, as time passes and he makes significant contributions to the field of science, he becomes a globally renowned scientist – a transformation that highlights option B. But even with this newfound fame, Einstein’s mindset towards his coat remains more or less the same. Though he is aware of his recognition and the expectations people have of him, he still doesn't see the need to buy a new coat. He believes that since everyone knows who he is, it shouldn't matter what he wears. This idea reflects option C. Additionally, the story of Einstein and the old coat could also be seen as an allegory for his general attitude towards materialism. For Einstein, the pursuit of knowledge and understanding the world around him held more importance than superficial appearances or possessions. Hence, his reluctance to replace his old coat illustrates his preference to focus on his work and research rather than on materialistic endeavors. In conclusion, as Einstein becomes a great scientist (option B), he still continues to wear his old clothes, specifically the old coat (option C).

Information:  - The Marxophone is a fretless zither with a system of metal hammers added for ease of playing . It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase .  - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B.  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.  - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins.  - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes.  - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time.  - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps.  - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era.  - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin.  - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F.  - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\".  - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth).  - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline.  - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola.  - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.  - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians.    What object entity has the relation of 'subclass of' with the subject 'marxophone'?

The chytrids are the simplest and most primitive Eumycota, or true fungi. The evolutionary record shows that the first recognizable chytrids appeared during the late preCambrian period, more than 500 million years ago. Like all fungi, chytrids have chitin in their cell walls, but one group of chytrids has both cellulose and chitin in the cell wall. Most chytrids are unicellular; a few form multicellular organisms and hyphae, which have no septa between cells (coenocytic). They produce gametes and diploid zoospores that swim with the help of a single flagellum. The ecological habitat and cell structure of chytrids have much in common with protists. Chytrids usually live in aquatic environments, although some species live on land. Some species thrive as parasites on plants, insects, or amphibians (Figure 24.10), while others are saprobes. The chytrid species Allomyces is well characterized as an experimental organism. Its reproductive cycle includes both asexual and sexual phases.

Lottery officials released the winning numbers for the largest multistate Powerball jackpot: 22, 10,13,14, 52, and the Powerball number is 11. One winning ticket was sold at a Publix supermarket in Zephyrhills, Florida, according to David Bishop, deputy secretary of the Florida lottery. Saturday's jackpot is a record 590.5 million. It marks the largest in Powerball history, surpassing a 587.6 million jackpot split by winners in Arizona and Missouri in November. The jackpot has a cash value of 376.9 million. \\"I buy mine here all the time. Yesterday, I was in Naples. I bought it in Naples, That's just my luck,\\" Butch Gonzalez, a regular lottery player, told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 outside the Publix in Zephyrhills. \\"I just hope whoever won really needs the money, and I hope they do right by it,\\" he said. The largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history was 656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. If there had been no winner in Saturday's Powerball, the jackpot would have shot up to 925 million for Wednesday's drawing, according to Kelly Cripe, spokeswoman for the Texas Lottery, which is part of the Powerball game. Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A single ticket costs 2, and the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175,223,510. Why you keep playing the lottery. Hate to break it to you, but you stand a better chance of walking onto the golf course and hitting two consecutive holes in one than winning the jackpot. But that didn't stop hundreds from driving to the Trex Mart in Dearborn, Missouri, where one of two winning tickets was sold in last year's 587 million Powerball drawing. About 100 people an hour were buying tickets at the store. At a convenience store in Riverside, Missouri, Jim Mansell said he was buying only one ticket. \\"I figure if the good Lord intends you to win, you only need one ticket,\\" he told CNN affiliate KCTV5. \\"But I don't know if the good Lord believes in gambling or not.\\" In Florida, winners must claim prizes at a state lottery retailer or lottery district office on or before the 180th day after the drawing. Any Powerball retailer in the state can validate a winning ticket. CNN's Scott Thompson and Jake Carpenter contributed to the report. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

There, Dudovitz, a longtime poverty lawyer and executive director of the San Fernando Valley's 36-year-old legal aid program, continues to struggle with his hostile takeover of the neighboring San Gabriel-Pomona Valleys service area one year after it was accomplished. On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Kevin Pietersen Ignites Controversy With His New Autobiography and Accuses ECB of Character Assassination; Leaked Dossier Adds Fuel to the Fire In a sensational turn of events, Kevin Pietersen, former England batsman, unveiled his new autobiography at a stunning Franciscan monastery, sparking controversy and igniting debate. The book, which delves into Pietersen's cricketing career and personal experiences, sheds light on the darker side of English cricket and has raised eyebrows amongst fans, players, and administrators alike. Adding more fuel to the fire is a dossier of information on Pietersen put together by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The document, leaked on Tuesday, alleges that Pietersen disobeyed then-coach Andy Flower's instructions ahead of the second Test. According to the dossier, Pietersen took two young players out drinking until late, defying Flower's orders. In response to these allegations, Pietersen has vehemently defended himself, stating, \\"My character has been assassinated for five or six years by the ECB press machine, but I can go to bed at night and sleep easy.\\" These strong words underscore the tumultuous relationship that Pietersen has had with the ECB and the English national team. The unveiling of the autobiography at a picturesque Franciscan monastery only added to the drama surrounding the launch. The choice of the venue and the significant revelations in the book have together given rise to speculation about Pietersen's intentions and the larger implications of this extraordinary affair. Pietersen's autobiography has, undoubtedly, lit bonfires around the national team. The book addresses a range of issues that have plagued English cricket in recent years, from the culture of bullying within the dressing room to the inefficiency of the team management. In doing so, Pietersen has opened a Pandora's box that could lead to further repercussions and inquiry into the inner dynamics of the team. The allegations in the leaked dossier have sent shockwaves through the cricketing community. Several former players and experts have weighed in on the ongoing controversy, with opinions ranging from support for Pietersen to outright condemnation. Some argue that Pietersen’s claims of character assassination by the ECB hold water, bearing in mind his impressive record and contributions to the England team. They contend that the organization should be held accountable for its targeted campaign against one of its most prominent players. Others, however, believe that Pietersen's actions, as stated in the dossier, warrant scrutiny and criticism, especially given the responsibilities he had as a senior team member. In conclusion, Kevin Pietersen's new autobiography, the leaked ECB dossier, and the Franciscan monastery launch have together created a perfect storm of controversy in the world of cricket. While Pietersen's character and actions have once again come under the spotlight, the underlying issues he has unearthed have sparked a broader debate about English cricket's management, culture, and performance. With passions running high, the fallout of this episode will be keenly watched and dissected for a long time to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Amy, who was fortunate enough to not have a cut on her finger, decided that today was the perfect occasion to wear her grandmother's treasured antique ring. Passed down through generations, this ring held a special place in Amy's heart, not only for its beauty but also for the history it represented. The intricately crafted band of yellow gold, adorned with a single shining emerald, was symbolic of her family's love, unity, and strength. As Amy carefully slipped the ring onto her finger, she reflected on her grandmother's stories about the many strong women that had worn it before. Each of these women had faced their own struggles and trials but, at the end of the day, they stayed true to their family roots. The emerald, a distinct choice of gemstone among her ancestors, symbolized growth and new beginnings, guiding each generation forward. Rebecca, intrigued by the shimmering piece of jewelry, gently examined Amy's finger. She delicately traced the delicate engravings along the gold band, in wonderment of the craftsmanship. She became curious about the stories behind the ring and listened attentively as Amy shared her family's tales - the adventures, heartbreaks, and victories. Rebecca, though envious of the beautiful heirloom, felt a sense of vulnerability knowing her own family did not possess such a tradition. Despite this, Amy believed that every family had a story to tell, however unconnected it may be to a physical object. The friendships established, acts of kindness, and sacrifices made—those were the real treasures that connected generations. Sharing these stories with people close to them breathed life into those memories, making them last forever. Amy then suggested to Rebecca that they could start a unique tradition of their own, initiating a legacy to pass down to future generations. One which celebrates the journeys of their families while symbolically intertwining their friendship. The two women spent hours brainstorming and decided on a simple and meaningful idea: a journal. This journal would capture their thoughts, dreams, and journeys so their descendants could relive their lives. The idea brought them closer than ever, as they became active participants in preserving their heritage. Rebecca, who initially felt uneasy about her lack of a family heirloom, embraced her newfound role in creating a legacy.

What is the answer?","output":"The Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart, also known as the Antifaschistischer Schutzwall in German, was the official name given to the Berlin Wall that separated East and West Berlin from 1961 to 1989. The term \\"Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart\\" was coined by the East German government to justify the construction of the wall and to ostensibly indicate that its purpose was to protect East Germany from alleged fascist elements in West Germany. The construction of the Berlin Wall began on August 13, 1961, under the orders of the East German government led by Walter Ulbricht, the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED). Physically, the wall was a massive concrete barrier, approximately 155 kilometers (96 miles) long, accompanied by various watchtowers, military checkpoints, and a heavily guarded \\"death strip.\\" The construction of the wall was motivated by political, social, and economic factors that arose during the years of the Cold War. The term \\"Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart\\" was intended as a propaganda tool to convince the East German population that the wall was necessary for their security and protection, rather than a measure to prevent them from fleeing to West Germany. By alluding to the shared history of World War II and the fight against Fascism, the East German government tried to create a narrative where the West was painted as the enemy, drawing upon memories of fascism and transforming the wall into a symbol of national defense. In reality, the primary purpose of the Berlin Wall was to prevent East Germans from leaving the country amidst a growing refugee crisis, as thousands of East Germans were crossing into West Berlin in search of better economic opportunities and political freedom. The Communist government in East Germany was struggling both economically and politically, so the wall served as a means to stabilize their situation and to maintain control over the population. The Berlin Wall stood for 28 years and became the iconic symbol of Cold War-era division, not only in Germany but also around the world. It was finally demolished in 1989, following a series of political changes and social unrest within East Germany. The fall of the Berlin Wall was one of the key events leading to the eventual reunification of Germany in October 1990, marking the end of the Cold War era and the separation of East and West Germany."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But some teachers think the changes are not all for the better. Eleanor Johnson, an English professor, thinks that text messaging has made students believe that it is far more acceptable than it actually is to just make terrible spelling and grammatical errors. And she says her students over the past several years have increasingly used less formal English in their writing. Words and phrases like \\"guy\\" and \\"you know\\" now appear in research papers. Professor Johnson supposes there is a strong relationship between the rise of informal online communication and an increase in writing mistakes. But she says there may not be much scientific information, at least not yet. David Crystal, a British linguist , says the actively changing nature of the Internet makes it difficult to keep up-to-date in studying its effects. But he believes its influence on language is small. The main effect of the Internet on language is the way it has added to the expressive richness of language, providing language with a new set of communicative tools that haven't existed in the past. Erin Jansen is founder of NetLingo.com, an online dictionary of the Internet and text messaging terms. She says the new technology has not changed existing language but has greatly added to its vocabulary. Basically it's freedom of expression. And what about those teachers who find these new kinds of mistakes in spelling and grammar in their students' work? What is her message to them? Erin Jansen said, \\"I am always on the students' side and won't get angry or upset about that. If it's helping the kids write more or communicate more, that's great. That's what teachers and educators want--to get kids communicating.\\" But Erin Jansen and David Crystal agree with Eleanor Johnson on at least one thing. Teachers need to make sure students understand the uses and rules of language. David Crystal and Erin Jansen share the view that the Internet   _  .

The Intelligenzaktion, a plan to eliminate the Polish intelligentsia, Poland's 'leadership class', took place soon after the German invasion of Poland, lasting from fall of 1939 till spring of 1940. As the result of this operation in 10 regional actions about 60,000 Polish nobles, teachers, social workers, priests, judges and political activists were killed. It was continued in May 1940 when Germany launched AB-Aktion, More than 16,000 members of the intelligentsia were murdered in Operation Tannenberg alone. Q: Who were the “intelligentia?”","output":"The \\"intelligentsia\\" refers to a social class or group of people distinguished by their high level of intellectual, cultural, and educational attainment. These individuals often play significant roles in shaping the society, politics, and culture of a nation. In the context of Poland during World War II, the intelligentsia commonly included individuals such as nobles, teachers, social workers, priests, judges, and political activists, who were considered the leadership class of the country. The intelligentsia was often characterized by their progressive views and commitment to the betterment of society. They played a crucial role in the development of the Polish state and its culture, as well as contributed to the spread of democratic ideals. Due to their influence and potential threat to the occupying forces of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, these groups were targeted for extermination under policies such as the Intelligenzaktion and AB-Aktion. The elimination of the intelligentsia during World War II had a lasting impact on Poland, with the loss of countless individuals who were instrumental in shaping the nation’s culture, history, and political landscape.

Have a friend help you stretch a tape measure from the front left corner to the back left corner of your truck bed, on the inside. The tape measure should be running in a straight line that's even with the top of the bed (make sure it isn't sagging in the middle).","output":"Now that you have measured the length of your truck bed, it’s essential to get the complete dimensions to determine its capacity accurately. To do this, you will need to measure the width and height as well. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you measure the other dimensions of your truck bed: 1. Measuring the Width: First, you will need to measure the truck bed width from side to side. This measurement should be taken from the inside edges of the bed to ensure accuracy. To do this, follow these steps: a. Secure the starting point of your measuring tape to one of the inside edges of the truck bed. You can either hook the tape or have a friend hold the starting point. b. Stretch the tape measure horizontally across the truck bed, ensuring the tape is straight and parallel to the ground. c. Measure the distance to the other inside edge of the bed, at both the widest part near the cab and the narrowest part near the tailgate. This will account for any differences in width due to the wheel wells or bed design. d. Record these measurements as the maximum and minimum width of your truck bed. 2. Measuring the Height: The height of a truck bed, commonly referred to as the depth, is also an essential dimension to consider when calculating its overall capacity. To measure the height, follow these steps: a. Decide on a location where you want to measure the height of the truck bed. Ideally, this should be at least a couple of feet from either corner to help balance out any differences in bedliner or construction. b. Hold the measuring tape vertically at the chosen spot, with the starting point resting on the bed's floor inside. c. Stretch the tape measure upward until you reach the top edge of the truck bed. d. Record this measurement as the height of your truck bed. You may want to take a couple of additional height measurements at different locations along the bed, just to ensure accuracy and account for any variations in height due to bedliner or design. With the length, width, and height measurements of your truck bed in hand, you can now calculate its overall capacity. To do this, use the following formula: Truck Bed Capacity = Length × Width × Height Remember to use the appropriate width measurement depending on the specific area you want to calculate. For example, if you measured different widths due to wheel wells, you'll want to consider them when determining the available space for specific items. Finally, it's essential to compare your calculated capacity with the manufacturer's specifications for your specific make and model of truck to ensure that the measurements align and that you do not exceed the recommended payload limits. This information can typically be found in your owner's manual or on the manufacturer's website."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"The person who started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses had what descent?\\"  Context: \\"Martin Luther, a German monk, started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of Wittenberg on October 31, 1517.

Which Swiss painter who lived from 1879 to 1940 was responsible for works such as 'The Red Balloon' in 1922, 'Landscape with Yellow Birds' in 1923 and 'Around the Fish' in 1926?","output":"The Swiss painter who lived from 1879 to 1940, responsible for creating the works 'The Red Balloon' in 1922, 'Landscape with Yellow Birds' in 1923, and 'Around the Fish' in 1926 is Paul Klee. Born on December 18, 1879, in Münchenbuchsee near Bern, Switzerland, Klee was an influential figure in the world of art, particularly during the 20th century. He is well-known for his distinctive and unique style that blended elements of Expressionism, Surrealism, and Abstraction. Paul Klee's inclination towards art began during his early years, and he pursued his passion by studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich from 1898 to 1901. He developed his personal style through experimenting with various mediums, including drawing, printmaking, and painting, working with watercolor, ink, and oil. Klee's first significant breakthrough came in 1911 when he was introduced to the group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), a prominent and influential German expressionist group founded in Munich by Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc. During this time, Klee had the opportunity to work alongside other eminent artists like August Macke, Alexej von Jawlensky, and Gabriele Münter. Der Blaue Reiter's influence had a profound impact on Klee's artistic approach, enabling him to explore color theory and create deeply emotive compositions. Paul Klee's unique artistic style was marked by his inventive use of form, color, and symbolism. He was inspired by various art movements, including Cubism, Expressionism, and Surrealism, which often blended his work, creating powerful compositions that transcended the conventional boundaries of artistic genres. In 1922, Klee created 'The Red Balloon,' which features a harmonious blend of geometric shapes with vibrant colors dominating the foreground. This captivating image of a child holding a red balloon edges towards abstraction while maintaining a dreamlike quality that resonated with Klee's reputation for the spiritual in art. 'Landscape with Yellow Birds,' a painting created in 1923, further demonstrates Klee's exploration of color and form. Using delicate watercolor techniques and composition, he portrayed birds perched along the sweeping, multicolored lines representing the landscape, evoking a sense of harmony between nature and form, showcasing the artist's enchanting universe. 'Around the Fish,' which he painted in 1926, is another example of Paul Klee's unique blend of artistic styles. This piece incorporates geometric fish, natural elements, and various culinary objects all beautifully arranged in surreal, dreamlike composition rendered through a rich color palette that embodies Klee's mastery over color. After a prolific career, Paul Klee passed away on June 29, 1940. Today, his artwork continues to be celebrated worldwide for its individualistic style, enchanting compositions, and lasting impact on various art movements. Exhibitions of his work are displayed in museums and galleries globally, showcasing the enduring legacy of his artistry and creative vision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Personally Nike is my favorite one--it's so simple. And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for  35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped  signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's \\" rainbow apple\\", a rainbow- colored silhouette    of an apple with a bite taken out of it.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Following the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central Susquehanna Valley, including in the area that would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784. In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses. The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of £500 (£ 56,400 in 2019) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland, comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29–32).

Since the user mentions that their stomach is sensitive and that consuming soda and pizza together would make them sick, it is reasonable to infer that they probably consumed one or both of these items before becoming horribly sick.

During this time the climate was a mixture of two different seasons , a dry season and a shorter rainy season . The climate during this period was a mixture of two different seasons , a rainy season and a shorter dry season .","output":"While these two sentences may seem similar at first glance, they do not convey the same meaning. The main difference between them lies in which season is described as shorter, which alters the overall understanding of the climate during the specified time period. In the first sentence: \\"During this time the climate was a mixture of two different seasons, a dry season and a shorter rainy season.\\" This conveys that the climate consisted of two seasons: a dry season of a standard length and a rainy season that was shorter in comparison to the dry season. The focus is on the dry season being longer and a significant portion of the time. Consequently, someone reading or hearing this sentence would likely get the impression that this area or time period had an overall dry and arid climate, with some periods of rainfall. In the second sentence: \\"The climate during this period was a mixture of two different seasons, a rainy season and a shorter dry season.\\" This sentence indicates that the climate consisted of two seasons as well, but here the rainy season is of standard length, and the dry season is shorter in comparison. The focus shifts to the rainy season being longer and taking up a significant portion of the time. As a result, readers or listeners would likely interpret this climate as predominantly wet or humid, with occasional dry periods. Considering the main difference is which season is shorter, the two sentences express different information about the prevalent climate during the mentioned time. The first sentence indicates a more arid climate with a shorter rainy season, while the second sentence suggests a moister climate with a shorter dry season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Which king appointed John Dryden as the first official Poet Laureate?","output":"John Dryden was appointed as the first official Poet Laureate by King Charles II of England. Charles II was the monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, reigning from the year 1660 until his death in 1685. Born on May 29, 1630, Charles II was a prominent figure of the British Restoration period that commenced with the monarchy's restoration after the demise of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland. During the Restoration period, there was a revival of arts, literature, and culture. Charles II was a patron of the arts and took an active interest in the promotion of literary works. His reign witnessed the rise of many artists and writers who went on to achieve prominence in their respective fields. John Dryden, an English poet, literary critic, and playwright, was appointed the first official Poet Laureate in 1668. Born on August 9, 1631, Dryden was a major literary figure in Restoration England. Prior to his appointment as Poet Laureate, Dryden had written several successful plays, poems, and works of literary criticism. He played an influential role in refining the English language and defining the literary style of the time, which made him a deserving candidate for the role of Poet Laureate. The role of Poet Laureate in the United Kingdom is an honorary one, traditionally given to a poet who is expected to create verse for significant national occasions and events. While there were earlier poets who served in similar capacities before John Dryden, it was during King Charles II's reign that the position was officially recognized and sanctioned. The appointment of Dryden as the first official Poet Laureate by King Charles II set the stage for a long line of poets who would hold this prestigious position, contributing greatly to English literature and history in the process. It is worth noting that John Dryden's appointment as Poet Laureate was influenced by his political inclination towards the Stuart court. During his tenure as Poet Laureate, Dryden published several odes and poems on themes related to politics, religion, and the monarchy. However, after the ascension of the Protestant King William III and Queen Mary II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Dryden, a Roman Catholic convert, lost his position as Poet Laureate due to his religious and political affiliations. Despite losing his title, Dryden continued to make significant contributions to English literature until his death on May 12, 1700."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Grim disappeared upstairs himself, and returned about ten minutes later in the uniform of a Shereefian officer--that is to say, of Emir Feisul's Syrian army. Nothing could be smarter, not anything better calculated to disguise a man. Disguise, as any actor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make- up as suggestion. It is little mannerisms--unstudied habits that identify. The suggestion that you are some one else is the thing to strive for, not the concealment of who you really are. Grim's skin had been sun-tanned in the Arab campaign under Lawrence against the Turks. The Shereefian helmet is a compromise between the East and West, having a strip of cloth hanging down behind it as far as the shoulders and covering the ears on either side, to take the place of the Arab head-dress. The khaki uniform had just enough of Oriental touch about it to distinguish it from that of a British officer. No man inexperienced in disguise would dream of choosing it; for the simple reason that it would not seem to him disguise enough. Yet Grim now looked so exactly like somebody else that it was hard to believe he was the same man who had been in the room ten minutes before.

QB Chad Pennington got off to a quick start, completing a 57-yard pass to Laveranues Coles. Both New York and Cincinnati were able to move the ball back and forth in the first half, ending the half with the Jets on top 20-10. The fourth quarter would eventually prove to be the Jets undoing, however. After giving up a touchdown in the third quarter to make the score 23-17, the Jets gave up three touchdowns and only scored their last touchdown in the closing seconds of the game, ending with a 38-31 loss. The fourth quarter was marked by many mistakes, including a costly pass interference by Darrelle Revis and a fumble and interception by Chad Pennington. The pass interference kept a Bengals drive alive, and the fumble gave the Bengals the ball at midfield. Finally, with 50&#160;seconds left in the game, Pennington throws a hurried pass into the hands of Bengal Johnathan Joseph, who runs the ball 42&#160;yards for the game-sealing touchdown.

What is the answer for the question: Who later expanded their original idea to include a third opera with mystic or religious tones? from the following article ?  The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works.

Problem:Abstract: To define the genetic changes of flat urothelial lesions, carcinoma in situ (CIS) and moderate dysplasias (DII) were investigated for alterations in the two chromosomal regions most frequently involved in bladder cancer. Overall, 33 CIS and 16 DII from 21 patients were used to microdissect urothelium. Dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using gene locus probes of 9q22 (FACC), 9p21 (CDK), 17p13 (p53), and related centromeric probes was applied on interphase nuclei. In parallel, preamplified DNA of these samples was used for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses with eight microsatellite markers on chromosomes 9p, 9q and 17p, and for sequencing of exons 5-9 of p53. Data indicated nearly identical deletion frequencies for chromosomes 9 and 17 for CIS (chromosome 9, 86%; p53, 84%). DII showed a lower deletion rate in comparison with CIS (chromosome 9, 75%; p53, 53%). A very high correlation between the results of FISH and LOH analyses was found. p53 mutations were detected in 12 of 15 patients (CIS, 72%; DII, 67%). In three of 16 patients with multifocal tumors, oligoclonal lesions were identified by LOH analyses, a finding further supported by sequencing of p53, by which two different p53 deletions were detected in two cases. In conclusion, data from microdissected flat urothelial lesions indicate that chromosome 9 deletions cannot be regarded as indicators of papillary growth, because they are found frequently in both types of flat lesions of the urothelium: those associated with papillary tumors and those that are not. The similar distribution and lower amount of genetic changes in DII render DII a possible precursor lesion of CIS..

Options: - arguments - dust poisoning - headache - exhaustion - boredom  Explain why a human would choose \\"headache\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"headache\\" as the answer to the question above because dust, when inhaled during housework, can lead to various physical discomforts, including headaches. When there is a lot of dust in the environment, particularly during cleaning activities, it can irritate the respiratory system and the eyes, causing discomfort and potentially a headache. Dust particles are typically small and can easily spread in the air, particularly during cleaning tasks such as sweeping, vacuuming, or dusting. When a person breathes in these particles, they can irritate the sensitive mucous membranes in the nose and throat, causing inflammation and discomfort. Prolonged exposure to dust can also worsen pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma or allergies, which can further contribute to headache development. Additionally, dust may contain various allergens, such as pollen, mold spores, or pet dander. In people who are sensitive to these allergens, exposure to dust can trigger an allergic reaction. The body responds to these allergens by releasing histamines, which can lead to inflammation and a variety of symptoms, including sinus congestion, sneezing, coughing, watery eyes, and, of course, headaches. Headaches caused by dust exposure may also be linked to eye strain and irritation, as dust particles coming in contact with the eyes can create discomfort and hinder vision. This eye irritation and strain can trigger headaches in some individuals. While the other options, such as arguments, dust poisoning, exhaustion, and boredom, can potentially result from housework or be associated with exposure to dust in varying contexts, they are less likely to be selected by a human as the primary outcome caused by dust exposure. The description of \\"a lot of dust\\" in the question heavily implies that the issue at hand is a physical health concern, which aligns more closely with the development of a headache rather than the other options presented. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"headache\\" as the answer to the question because exposure to high levels of dust during housework can lead to various physical and respiratory discomforts, of which headache is a common and well-recognized symptom. This selection is further supported by the overall context of the question, which emphasizes the impact of dust on health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Chinese New Year is now known as the Spring Festival because it starts from the beginning of spring. Though there are some sayings about its origin, all agree that the word Nian, which in modern Chinese means \\"year\\", was originally the name of a beast that started to eat people the night before the beginning of a new year. One story goes that the beast Nian had a very big mouth that would take in a great many people at one time. People were very afraid. One day, an old man came to their help and said he would stop all this. He said to Nian, \\"I hear that you are very strong, but can you eat up all the beasts on earth instead of people who are too weak to be your enemies?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Nian agreed with him and went to kill many of the beasts on earth. People were very happy because those beasts also did bad things to people and killed their farm animals from time to time. After that, the old man, who was a god, rode on the beast Nian and left. Nian was gone, and other beasts also went into forests; people began to enjoy their happy life. Before the old man left, he had told people to put up red paper-cuts on their windows and doors at each year's end to drive Nian away, because red is the color the beast felt most afraid of. From then on, every year at the beginning of spring, people prepare to \\"Guo Nian\\". The word \\"Guo Nian\\" means \\"go through the Nian safely\\". Putting up red paper-cuts to drive Nian away and making dumplings for a better new year are still an every-year doing by the Chinese people. However, people today have long forgotten why they are doing all this, they just feel the color and the food make the New Year very enjoyable.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who used photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent? , can you please find it?   In 1960, Ronald William Clark published a biography titled Sir Mortimer Wheeler. FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \\"this very readable little book\\" as being \\"adulatory\\" in tone, \\"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent. In 2011, the academic journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public. Two years later, the Papers from the Institute of Archaeology issued a short comic strip by Moshenska and Alex Salamunovich depicting Wheeler's activities in studying the archaeology of Libya during World War II.","output":"The first name of the person who used photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent is Mortimer.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"According to a study by Dr. Paul Brest, Hispanics or \\"Latinos\\" include immigrants who are descendants of immigrants from the countries comprising Central and South America. In 1991, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans made up 80% of the Latino population in the United States. Latinos are disadvantaged compared to White Americans and are more likely to live in poverty. They are the least well educated major ethnic group and suffered a 3% drop in high school completion rate while African Americans experienced a 12% increase between 1975-1990. In 1990, they constituted 9% of the population, but only received 3.1% of the bachelors's degrees awarded. At times when it is favorable to lawmakers, Latinos were considered \\"white\\" by the Jim Crow laws during the Reconstruction. In other cases, according to Paul Brest, Latinos have been classified as an inferior race and a threat to white purity. Latinos have encountered considerable discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and education. Brest finds that stereotypes continue to be largely negative and many perceive Latinos as \\"lazy, unproductive, and on the dole.\\" Furthermore, native-born Latino-Americans and recent immigrants are seen as identical since outsiders tend not to differentiate between Latino groups.\\"? Answer:","output":"Based on the passage, how has the Latino population in the United States been affected by issues such as poverty, education, and discrimination, and what are some common stereotypes they face?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Why are terrorists targeting schools and universities? Over the last 13 months there has been a series of extremely bloody attacks on schools, colleges and universities. On Wednesday Taliban suicide bombers mounted an assault in north-western Pakistan; just over a year ago the same movement attacked a school only 30 miles away,killing 150 people, most of them children. In April last year 147 were killed in a massacre at a university in northern Kenya by the Somalia-based al-Shabaab. Then there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of other incidents of violence directed at educational institutions, teachers or students across the world which have not been reported. Related: Pakistan attacks: at least 30 dead in terror raid at Bacha Khan University Why would terrorists attack such targets? One obvious answer is because they can. Schools are usually unprotected. Embassies, military bases, even hotels are, after a decade and a half of rolling waves of terrorist violence across the world, now harder to hit. But there are other reasons, too. Terrorism aims to undermine the legitimacy and authority of a state. In many parts of the world, the local school is that state’s only tangible presence. Another goal is simply to stall education, of both girls and boys, though the former tends to prompt a greater reaction. In 2012 the Pakistani Taliban tried to kill a 15-year-old schoolgirl, Malala Yousufzai, who went on to become an international icon. A more pragmatic aim may be to send a message to policymakers or even to the general public. What is clear is that such attacks are increasing. Data compiled by the University of Maryland in the US shows a dramatic increase in violence directed at schools following the 2004 massacre at a school in Beslan in southern Russia of more than 300 people, including 186 children. This is easily explained. It is in line with the rise of terrorism more generally over the period. The proportion of attacks on educational institutions overall – between 3% and 5% – has barely changed. But, again reflecting a more general trend, the attacks are now much more lethal. According to another recent study by the University of Maryland, “mass-fatality terrorist events” – defined as those in which more than 100 people are killed by terrorists in one country in one day – occurred just over four times a year on average between 1978 and 2013. In 2014, there were 26. In 2015, the number is equivalent or higher, depending on how many of the massacres carried out by Islamic State and Boko Haram, the extremist movement based in north-eastern Nigeria, are counted. Boko Haram has made targeting schools and students a priority, most infamously abducting 276 schoolgirls in 2014. Nigerian officials say they still have no idea where they are. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is talking about how terrorists are attacking schools and universities more often. The important parts are: 1. There have been many bloody attacks on schools, colleges, and universities in the last 13 months. 2. Terrorists are targeting schools because they are usually unprotected and easier to attack than places like embassies or military bases. 3. Attacking schools can hurt the government's power and make people scared. 4. Sometimes terrorists want to stop children, especially girls, from getting an education. 5. The number of attacks on schools has gone up a lot since 2004. 6. These attacks have become more deadly, with more people getting hurt or killed. The article also mentions some specific attacks and groups, like the Taliban in Pakistan, al-Shabaab in Kenya, and Boko Haram in Nigeria."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The 105th meridian west of Greenwich, the longitudinal reference for the Mountain Time Zone, passes directly through Denver Union Station. Denver is ranked as a Beta- world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. With a 2015 estimated population of 682,545, Denver ranks as the 19th-most populous U.S. city, and with a 2.8% increase in 2015, the city is also the fastest growing major city in the United States.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - Prudential Center is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the central business district of Newark, New Jersey, United States. It was designed by HOK Sport (now Populous), with the exterior designed by Morris Adjmi Architects.

In December 2013, the arena ranked third nationally and ninth internationally for self-reported annual revenue.  - In New Jersey folklore, the Jersey Devil is a legendary creature said to inhabit the Pine Barrens of southern New Jersey, United States. The creature is often described as a flying biped with hooves, but there are many different variations. The common description is that of a kangaroo-like creature with the head of a goat, leathery bat-like wings, horns, small arms with clawed hands, cloven hooves and a forked tail. It has been reported to move quickly and often is described as emitting a \\"blood-curdling scream\\".   - The Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (French: \\"Ligue de hockey junior majeur du Québec\\", abbreviated \\"QMJHL\\" in English, \\"LHJMQ\\" in French) is one of the three major junior ice hockey leagues which constitute the Canadian Hockey League. The league is often simply referred to as \\"The Q\\". The league comprises teams across the provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Since the departure of the Lewiston Maineiacs from Lewiston, Maine, the QMJHL is the only one of the three member leagues of the CHL that does not currently have teams located in the United States (the OHL has teams in Michigan and Pennsylvania while the WHL has teams in Washington and Oregon).

The Appalachians are also home to two species of fir, the boreal balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and the southern high elevation endemic, Fraser fir (Abies fraseri). Fraser fir is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, where along with red spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. Fraser fir rarely occurs below 5,500 ft (1,700 m), and becomes the dominant tree type at 6,200 ft (1,900 m). By contrast, balsam fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians, but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians, where it is usually confined above 3,900 ft (1,200 m) asl, except in cold valleys. Curiously, it is associated with oaks in Virginia. The balsam fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser fir. While red spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats, balsam fir, as well as black spruce and tamarack, are more characteristic of the latter.

Answer the following question: Kendall didn't want to eat the lunch their mother made them so Kendall threw the lunch to the dogs.  Given the question \\"How would you describe Kendall?\\", is \\"Wasteful\\" a valid answer? Choose your answer from: 1). Yes. 2). No. Answer:","output":"1). Yes. Describing Kendall as \\"wasteful\\" is a valid answer. Here is a detailed explanation as to why: Kendall's action of throwing the lunch their mother made for them to the dogs, rather than consuming it or trying to diplomatically address the issue, can be seen as an act of waste, particularly when considering the time, effort, and resources that went into the preparation of the meal. Kendall didn't seem to take these factors into account when they chose to dispose of the lunch in this manner. By discarding the lunch, Kendall wasted the ingredients used to make it, as well as the energy and time their mother devoted to preparing the meal. Moreover, their action could lead to spoilage, as the dogs might not consume the entire lunch. Furthermore, the discarded meal could have had another purpose, such as being offered to another family member or consumed at a later time. In addition to being wasteful, Kendall's behavior might also be seen as disrespectful toward their mother, as they disregarded her efforts in providing sustenance. Instead of discussing their preferences or other solutions with their mother, Kendall chose a more impulsive and thoughtless approach. In conclusion, describing Kendall as \\"wasteful\\" is a valid answer due to the various factors mentioned above. However, it is essential to note that this description might not encompass the entirety of Kendall's character, and it should not be used as a generalization. There might be other aspects of Kendall's personality, and it is possible that they could have been acting out of character in this particular situation. Nonetheless, based solely on this specific event, \\"wasteful\\" is an appropriate adjective to use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She learns that her talent is to be one of the tinkers, the fairies who make and fix things. Two other tinker fairies, Bobble (Rob Paulsen) and Clank (Jeff Bennett), teach her their craft, and tell her about the fairies who visit the mainland to bring each season.

After meeting them, she notices Vidia (Pamela Adlon), a fast-flying fairy who immediately dislikes her because of her unusually strong talent. Vidia challenges her to prove she will be able to go to the mainland, and Tinker Bell creates several inventions, which she shows to the Minister of Spring (Steve Valentine).

Which language is this?","output":"The language used in this sentence, \\"Bu şekilde ABD hükümetinin sağladığı başlangıç sermayesini de ikiye katladı,\\" is Turkish. Turkish is a major language spoken in Turkey and the surrounding regions. It belongs to the Turkic language family, and it's written in a Latin script that was established as the official alphabet in 1928 under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Turkey itself is located between southeastern Europe and western Asia and holds a unique position as a nation straddling these two continents. The influence of both European and Asian cultures is thus easily observed in its language, traditions, and sociocultural norms.  Linguistic characteristics of Turkish include vowel harmony (where the vowels within a word need to harmonise with each other in terms of their placement and characteristics) and agglutination (where a lot of grammatical information is packed into suffixes that are attached to the root of a word). There are no genders in Turkish which simplifies the language for learners somewhat, and word order also differs from most other major languages - typically in Turkish the subject of a sentence comes first, followed by the object and then the verb. The given sentence translates to \\"In this way, it doubled the seed capital provided by the US government.\\" This statement can apply in a wide range of contexts, such as investment, financial aid, or business ventures, among others. The specific context would provide further meaning to this statement. Overall, Turkish, being the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, has a rich history and plays a significant role in world affairs due to Turkey's geopolitical position. Especially the country's roles in NATO, G20, and other international alliances contribute to the global presence of the Turkish language. Therefore, learning and understanding Turkish becomes useful in many fields, from diplomacy to business and trade."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Available choices: A. wanted to get into a good college. B. get books. C. study. Answer:","output":"Tracy chose to dedicate an entire week to studying for the SATs on Saturday because she wanted to get into a good college (Option A). The SATs, or the Scholastic Assessment Test, is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It is designed to assess a student's readiness for college and serves as a key factor in college application evaluations. By investing time and effort in preparing for the SATs, Tracy aimed to perform well on this crucial test. A high SAT score is often recognized as an important factor by colleges and universities when deciding which students to admit. A good score can significantly improve Tracy's chances of getting accepted into a reputable institution, which is essential for her future academic and professional success. In addition to increasing her chances of acceptance in a competitive college, having a strong SAT score can also qualify Tracy for academic scholarships and other forms of financial aid. These opportunities can help offset the cost of tuition, books, and other expenses, enabling Tracy to pursue her education without being burdened by financial stress. In summary, Tracy dedicated a week to studying for the SATs because she wanted to secure her chances of getting into a good college. By putting in the effort to prepare for the test, she sought to improve her score, boost her college application, and potentially qualify for scholarships and other financial aid opportunities.

Elk Modern subspecies are descended from elk that once inhabited Beringia, a steppe region between Asia and North America that connected the two continents during the Pleistocene. Beringia provided a migratory route for numerous mammal species, including brown bear, camel, horse, caribou, and moose, as well as humans. As the Pleistocene came to an end, ocean levels began to rise; elk migrated southwards into Asia and North America. In North America they adapted to almost all ecosystems except for tundra, true deserts, and the gulf coast of the U.S. The elk of southern Siberia and central Asia were once more widespread but today are restricted to the mountain ranges west of Lake Baikal including the Sayan and Altai Mountains of Mongolia and the Tianshan region that borders Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and China's Xinjiang Province. The habitat of Siberian elk in Asia is similar to that of the Rocky Mountain subspecies in North America. Is this statement correct \\"is a caribou the same as an elk\\"?","output":"No, sweetie, a caribou is not the same as an elk. They are both big animals that are part of the deer family, but they have differences. Think of it this way: just like a cat and a dog are both pets but different from each other, a caribou and an elk are both big deer-like animals, but they’re also different from each other.  Elks are usually found in forests and can have really big antlers that look like a tree branch. Caribous, which are also called reindeer in some places (yes, just like the ones that pull Santa's sleigh), usually live in really cold places, like the North Pole, and both boy and girl caribous can have antlers, not just boys like in most deer families.

Definition: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Input: By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The critcism comes from Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who said some firms had paid no tax and hidden their earnings offshore. And he promised to back the regulator Ofwat in tightening up rules to protect bill-payers and the environment. The industry body Water UK responded that the companies were dealing firmly with issues that threatened trust. But Mr Gove’s speech to a water industry conference must have made uncomfortable listening. He complained that water firms had paid out almost all of their £18bn profits to shareholders, instead of re-investing it in mending leaks and protecting the environment. And he named names: The boss of United Utilities taking home £2.8m a year; the head of Severn Trent, £2.4m. The secretary of state said last year Anglian and Southern paid zero corporation tax, whilst Thames has paid no corporation tax for a decade. He suggested: \\"Some of their best brains appear to be as intent on financial engineering as much as real engineering.\\" Mr Gove promised to back recommendations from the regulator Ofwat due to be published in April – and said he would not hesitate to increase the pressure. He told the firms: \\"You may be private companies, but you have a responsibility to the public who can’t take their custom elsewhere.\\" The politician complained that three billion litres of water still leak out every day - and said the figure has barely improved in the past four years. He said there had been no investment in new nationally significant supply infrastructure, such as major reservoirs, since privatisation. Craig Bennett from Friends of the Earth welcomed the comments but said Mr Gove could do much more himself to improve management of water. \\"Defra are not doing enough,\\" he told BBC News. \\"They are still allowing new houses on flood plains – and there is constant backsliding on the need to use water more efficiently.\\" Dr Matt Prescott from the Environmental Rating Agency told BBC News: “The environmental problems with the industry are a signal of financial problems \\"We need effective regulation – it’s clearly not happening at the moment. Politicians can’t just have an obsession with bills.\\" Dr Prescott said that during the recent prosecution of Thames Water at Aylesbury Crown Court they found that the Environment Agency did not have direct access to independently sourced pollution monitoring data. Instead, they had to rely on to water companies to self-monitor pollution levels discharged from sewage works. \\"We think these forms of self-regulation should stop,\\" he said. Water UK Chief Executive Michael Roberts countered that companies were putting public interest first. \\"Water is fundamental to all of our lives, and companies fully understand their clear responsibility to act in the public interest,\\" he said. \\"For me, that boils down to doing the right thing in the right way, and tackling issues where they arise, because we want to maintain the high levels of trust our customers have for us. \\"We know that they trust us, because more than eight out of 10 of them say so in our private polling. \\"We should not lose sight of that as we address some of the issues that critics have raised.

Question: \\"Why did change his name to Napoleon Bonaparte?\\"  Context: \\"Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769, to Carlo Maria di Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, in his family's ancestral home Casa Buonaparte in Ajaccio, the capital of the island of Corsica. He was their fourth child and third son. This was a year after the island was transferred to France by the Republic of Genoa. He was christened Napoleone di Buonaparte, probably named after an uncle (an older brother who did not survive infancy was the first of the sons to be called Napoleone). In his 20s, he adopted the more French-sounding Napoléon Bonaparte.[note 2]\\"  Answer:","output":"Napoleon Bonaparte, initially born as Napoleone di Buonaparte, changed his name in his 20s to adopt a more French-sounding name. There are several reasons that led to this decision. 1. Assimilation into French society: When Corsica became a part of France, the residents of the island, including the Buonaparte family, were incorporated into the French society. By changing his name to a more French-sounding version, Napoleon aimed to better assimilate into the French culture, as it would facilitate his acceptance and opportunities within the society. This change would make it easier for him to pursue education, establish connections, and seek career advancements in the French mainland. 2. Rise in Military and Political Career: Napoleon went to mainland France to pursue his education and military training, where he joined the French Army and later rose through the ranks to become a prominent political and military figure. By adopting the name Napoléon Bonaparte, he was sending a clear message that he had integrated to French society and was dedicated to the French cause. The French-sounding name would enable him to gain respect and trust, both from the military and the civilian population. 3. Elimination of possible discrimination: As a Corsican with an Italian-sounding name in the French military and political landscape, Napoleon could have faced discrimination and other obstacles due to his origins. By adopting a French-sounding name, he minimized the risk of being ostracized or facing resistance due to his identity. This strategic decision allowed him to focus on his military and political aspirations without worrying about potential backlash or bias stemming from his name. 4. Reputation and branding: By the time Napoleon changed his name, he had started to build a reputation as a skilled military officer. He understood the importance of building a strong personal brand and saw the benefits of better aligning his name with the French culture. Transforming his name from Napoleone di Buonaparte to Napoléon Bonaparte showcased this intent and helped him solidify his image as a rising star in France's military and political landscape. In conclusion, Napoleon's decision to change his name by adopting a more French-sounding version was a calculated move aimed at better assimilating into the French society, advancing in his career, avoiding potential discrimination, and strengthening his personal brand. This change in his name played a significant role in helping him achieve the incredible feats that defined his life and career, eventually leading him to become one of history's most famous leaders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bellette continued to paint classical scenes, and around 1950 produced the work Chorus without Iphigenia. Purchased by the National Gallery of Australia in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \\"posed like statues in a tableau vivant, [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\\". Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette: Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death. In 1951, Bellette came second in the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Competition, behind the young Jeffrey Smart.

Please answer a question about the following article about Geological history of Earth: Earth was initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10% of the Earth's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow. Some of this object's mass merged with the Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered from comets, produced the oceans. The initial state of earth was what?","output":"The initial state of Earth was molten, characterized by extreme volcanism and frequent collisions with other celestial bodies. During this period, Earth was subject to extremely high temperatures, which caused the formation of molten rock and metals. The planet's outer layer was in a constant state of flux, and it lacked a solid crust. The formation of a solid crust began much later when the outer layer started to cool down, allowing water to accumulate in the atmosphere. Concurrently, a series of geological and astronomical events — including the formation of the Moon due to a significant impact and the gradual development of Earth's primordial atmosphere — guided the Earth's evolution towards its current state. Ultimately, the condensing water vapor combined with ice from comets helped create the oceans that cover the majority of Earth's surface today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court? is inside the article: (English: \\"The Marriage of Thetis\\") After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought..., can you guess it ?

The signs of a choking cat include :  Inability to breathe coughing forcefully drooling or gagging pawing at the mouth  Be aware of signs that mimic choking.","output":"Step 1: Ensure your own safety Before attempting to help the choking cat, make sure you are in a safe environment and have the necessary tools and supplies. It's important to act quickly, but also to remain calm and collected throughout the process.  Step 2: Secure the cat Carefully wrap the cat in a towel or blanket to help restrict its movement and avoid any accidental scratches or bites. It's vital to keep the cat as still as possible to prevent further injury or stress.  Step 3: Open and check the cat's mouth Gently open the cat's mouth and inspect it for any visible obstructions. If you can see the object, use a pair of tweezers or your fingers to carefully remove it. Be cautious not to accidentally push the object deeper into the cat's throat.  Step 4: Perform the Heimlich maneuver for cats (if necessary) If the obstruction cannot be removed manually, perform the Heimlich maneuver for cats. To do this, place the cat on its side, with its back against your chest. Place one hand under the cat's chest, just below the ribcage, and use your other hand to apply pressure in an upward and inward motion. Repeat this process several times to help dislodge the object.  Step 5: Assess the situation After attempting the previous steps, reassess the cat's condition. If the choking signs have stopped and the cat appears to be breathing normally, the object may have been dislodged. If not, continue attempting to clear the obstruction, but also consider seeking immediate professional assistance. Step 6: Seek veterinary help Even if the cat has successfully stopped choking, it's essential to have them checked by a veterinarian. There may be underlying issues that have caused the choking incident, or the cat may have suffered injuries during the situation. In summary, after identifying a choking cat and being aware of the signs that mimic choking, the most logical next event is to secure the cat and attempt to remove any visible obstructions in its mouth or perform the Heimlich maneuver for cats. After the situation is resolved, seek veterinary help to ensure the cat's health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which very famous door cannot be opened from the outside?","output":"The very famous door that cannot be opened from the outside is the door of the British Prime Minister's official residence, 10 Downing Street. The residence, located in Westminster, London, is one of the most recognized and iconic buildings in the United Kingdom. It serves as the headquarters and primary residence of the serving prime minister, and has been home to numerous British leaders since Sir Robert Walpole became the first prime minister to reside there in 1735. The black front door of 10 Downing Street is an essential symbol of the British government and has various security, historical, and symbolic qualities that distinguish it from other doorways. Here are some of the key features and functionality of the door: 1. No exterior handle: One of the primary security features of the door is that it lacks any handle or knob on the outside. This design decision was deliberately made to keep the building secure and prevent unauthorized access. Consequently, the door cannot be opened from the outside, preventing potential intruders or uninvited guests from entering the property. 2. Reinforced for security: The door is approximately 5.5 ft. (1.67 m) tall and 3 ft. (0.91 m) wide, and it is made from a heavy and secure blast-resistant material to protect the occupants from potential attacks. It is also said to be bulletproof and airtight, providing additional safety precautions for its residents. 3. Painted in glossy black: The front door is traditionally painted in dark glossy black. The striking color contributes to the iconic appearance of 10 Downing Street, as does the brass hardware and emblematic white fanlight window located above the door. 4. Number 10 on the door: A large white number 10 adorns the center of the door, signifying the building's address. The number is distinctively slanted to the right, with the zero sitting slightly higher than the one, adding to its distinctive appearance. 5. Traditional lion door knocker: The door also features a large brass door knocker in the shape of a lion's head. The door knocker is a historic design element and is instantly recognizable as the symbol of Downing Street's famous front door. 6. Letterbox and doorknob: The door has a brass letterbox that is inscribed with the words \\"First Lord of the Treasury,\\" which is an official title for the British Prime Minister. A brass doorknob is also present on the right side of the door, but it is only functional from the inside. Due to the security risks associated with the prominent position of the Prime Minister and various terrorist threats in the past, No. 10 Downing Street has undergone several security upgrades and changes throughout the years. However, the decision to maintain a front door without an exterior handle or knob continues to be an essential and defining feature of this historic and famous location."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No, the given sentence does not answer the question \\"How did Gaddafi die?\\" Instead, it provides information about Gaddafi's actions that led to Libya being labeled an \\"international pariah.\\" It mentions the unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, Gaddafi's support for foreign militants, and his alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing. To answer the question about Gaddafi's death, we must explore the events that occurred towards the end of his rule. Muammar Gaddafi, the former Libyan leader, was killed on October 20, 2011, near his hometown of Sirte in Libya. His death was a result of the Libyan Civil War, which was a conflict between Gaddafi's government and various rebel forces that sought to oust him from power. The civil war began in February 2011, following the Arab Spring movement that swept across North Africa and the Middle East. The movement led to widespread protests and uprisings against the regimes in countries like Tunisia and Egypt. In Libya, the protests rapidly evolved into an armed conflict between Gaddafi loyalists and anti-Gaddafi rebels. The conflict escalated, and the United Nations imposed a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians. The situation attracted international intervention. NATO and its partners launched a military campaign called Operation Unified Protector, with the aim of enforcing the no-fly zone and protecting civilians from Gaddafi's forces. This operation significantly weakened Gaddafi's government and military capabilities. By August 2011, rebel forces had entered the capital city of Tripoli, and Gaddafi's regime began to collapse. He fled the capital and went into hiding. On October 20, 2011, Gaddafi was discovered by opposition forces hiding in a drainage pipe near Sirte, his hometown. He was captured by rebels from the Misrata-based brigade and then violently killed by his captors. Graphic images and videos of the capture and killing were widely circulated around the world, marking the brutal end of Gaddafi's 42-year rule. In summary, the sentence provided does not answer the question about Gaddafi's death. Instead, it gives information about events that led to Libya being branded an \\"international pariah\\" under Gaddafi's rule."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Based on this information, all three options— the sun, volcanic sources, and megapodes— are indeed sources of warmth for incubation. However, your question asks for the option that is not a source of warmth for incubation. It appears that there may be some confusion in the question itself, as the provided passage indicates that all three options you mention are indeed sources of warmth for incubation. Megapodes are a type of bird that use external heat sources like the sun and volcanic sources to keep their eggs warm; thereby, aiding in incubation.

Instead, Linnet marries Simon herself and they head off for a honeymoon in Egypt (the same place where Jacqueline had planned her honeymoon with Simon). A bitter Jacqueline follows them to Egypt, appearing wherever they go. Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) is also on holiday in Egypt. While staying in the same hotel as the newlyweds, he is approached by Linnet Doyle who is getting tired of Jacqueline's harassment. Poirot doesn't accept the job, as he believes that Jacqueline has been treated shamefully by Linnet and Simon. He nevertheless tries to warn Jacqueline against pursuing the Doyles any further. She ignores his warning and joins their cruise on the river Nile. Linnet Doyle comments that she is \\"surrounded by enemies\\" on the cruise, as some of the other travellers are also known to her. They include Andrew Pennington (David Soul), her American trustee, who has orchestrated their 'coincidental' meeting in Egypt in order for her to sign some legal documents. Linnet has also upset her maid Louise (Felicite du Jeu) by interfering in her romantic affairs.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  From 1916, Nielsen taught at the Royal Academy where he became director in 1931, shortly before his death. He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings. The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued. An international Organ Competition, founded by the city of Odense, became associated with the Nielsen competition in 2009, but from 2015 will be organized separately, based in Odense Cathedral.","output":"Nielsen"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"The player for the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1947-48 season who earned the nickname \\"Mr. Basketball\\" was George Mikan. Born on June 18, 1924, in Joliet, Illinois, George Mikan was an American professional basketball player who became one of the most dominant forces in the first decade of the NBA. Mikan was a 6-foot-10-inch tall center with a remarkable set of skills that allowed him to excel not only defensively but offensively as well. His dominance inside the paint and on the boards, combined with an effective hook shot, helped him become a prolific scorer and rebounder in the early years of the league. After a successful college basketball career with the DePaul University Blue Demons, where he was coached by Hall of Famer Ray Meyer, Mikan was drafted by the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1946. After the Gears folded, he was picked up by the Minneapolis Lakers in 1947, beginning his career in the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which later merged with the NBL to form the NBA. Mikan was a four-time All-Star and a six-time All-NBA First Team Selection. During his time with the Lakers, the team won five championships in six years (1949, 1950, 1952, 1953, and 1954). Mikan's on-court presence was so transcendent that he was able to significantly impact the way basketball was played and officiated. As a dominant big man with excellent defensive instincts, Mikan played a key role in the NBA's eventual decision to widen the lane from six feet to twelve feet in an attempt to neutralize his proficiency inside the paint. Additionally, Mikan's propensity for goaltending shots led the league to establish goaltending rules. Consequently, his achievements earned him the nickname \\"Mr. Basketball,\\" a testament to his contribution to the growth and development of the sport. George Mikan retired in 1956, ending a decorated career in which he was consistently one of the top players in the league. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, solidifying his status as one of basketball's all-time greats. Moreover, Mikan's \\"Mr. Basketball\\" moniker has lived on and has been synonymous with legendary players who have had a profound effect on the sport. In conclusion, George Mikan, who played for the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1947-48 season, was nicknamed \\"Mr. Basketball\\" due to his dominating presence on the court, his innovative style of play, and his significant contributions to the evolution of the sport. As a trailblazer in the early years of professional basketball, Mikan's impact can still be seen in today's NBA; his legacy is an integral part of basketball history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Because the problem directly gives us the ratio (2:3) in which the profit earned was divided between P and Q. Part #2: Set up an equation based on the given information. Usage: Based on the information given, we can set up a linear equation that represents the investments made by P and Q. Let the investment made by Q be x.

A:","output":"I understand your perspective about the oak tree falling and making sunlight available to surrounding plants. However, the initial question seems to be asking for a general answer about what natural phenomenon typically allows sunlight to reach nearby plants. In this case, it is not specifically about grass or oak trees. The more relevant answer would focus on the process of plant growth and competition for resources, such as sunlight. In a plant community or ecosystem, larger plants and trees may block sunlight from reaching the smaller plants around them. When these larger plants die or fall, they create a gap in the canopy, allowing sunlight to become available to the surrounding smaller plants. This occurrence is known as gap dynamics.  Gap dynamics is an essential process in maintaining the balance of an ecosystem. As older, taller, or more established plants die or are removed, it allows younger plants and different species to grow. This process promotes biodiversity and regeneration in the plant community. So, the right answer to the question \\"what falls making sunlight available to surrounding plants?\\" would be something like \\"larger plants, trees, or other barriers to sunlight that are removed from the plant community through natural processes, such as death, disturbance, or falling.

The fact that they are described as \\"delights\\" suggests that they hold a special place in the local or regional cuisine, and there is demand and interest in continuing to prepare them today. The term \\"culinary delights\\" itself often refers to dishes that have a rich history or tradition and are still valued in modern cuisine. In the case of Echizen crab and Echizen soba, these recipes likely have their roots in the Echizen region of Japan, which is known for its seafood and buckwheat noodle dishes. The fact that these dishes are still considered \\"delights\\" today signifies that the traditional recipes continue to be enjoyed and appreciated in contemporary times. Echizen crab, also known as Echizen-gani and botan-gani, is a prized Japanese winter delicacy. Native to the Sea of Japan, this species of crab is rich in flavor, making it highly sought after in the culinary world. The harvesting season of Echizen crab is typically from November to March and is a significant component of the local fishing culture. Today, Echizen crab is still used in various dishes such as Sashimi, grilled, boiled, hot pot, and more, retaining their position as a culinary delight in the community. Echizen soba, on the other hand, is a well-known Japanese buckwheat noodle dish and a regional specialty of Fukui Prefecture, which includes the former Echizen Province. The distinctive Echizen soba is characterized by its slightly thicker and rough texture which gives it a unique mouthfeel. This soba's preparation methods differ from those of others, and it is often served with tasty dipping sauces or garnishes.

One of the best movies of the year with its extraordinary depiction of plight of Indian widows and their yearning for liberation.","output":"The movie review appears to be about \\"Water\\", a film directed by Deepa Mehta.  Released in 2005, \\"Water\\" is the third instalment of Mehta's Elements trilogy. It is preceded by 'Fire' (1996) and 'Earth' (1998). The film, set in 1938 and filmed in Sri Lanka, explores the lives of widows at an ashram in Varanasi, India. The plot of 'Water' revolves around Chuyia, an eight-year-old child widow who is sent to a home where Hindu widows must live out their remaining lives in penitence. Unaware of her status as a widow, Chuyia refuses to adapt to the regimented lifestyle enforced by the oppressive Madhumati, the head widow. Chuyia's presence reverberates throughout the ashram, especially affecting Shakuntala, a devout widow, and Kalyani, a beautiful younger widow who being the best looking is exploited by being prostituted.  In its poignant portrayal of these women, their plight, and their yearning for liberation, the movie provides viewers with a vivid picture of the gender, theological, and social injustices of the time. It offers a deep exploration of the circumstances of marginalized widows, challenging societal norms of oppression, especially those existing due to certain interpretations of religion.  The characters and their stories are constructed with depth and nuance, fostering in viewers a deep understanding and empathy. The cinematography, capturing the heartbreaking beauty of Varanasi along the Ganges River, is an integral part of the narrative, contributing to the film's wide acclaim.  Perhaps what's most compelling about \\"Water\\" is its exploration of the dichotomy between tradition and change, between sacred and profane, and between freedom and enslavement. It is a deeply affecting film that encourages viewers to grapple with societal norms, tradition, and the interpretation and application of religious texts.  \\"Water\\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006, making it the first non-French-language Canadian film to receive a nomination in that category. It also won three awards from the Film Critics Circle of India. Despite its critical acclaim, the film was a subject of controversy and experienced protests from conservative groups in India. Undeniably, 'Water' is a significant work in global cinema, not just for its compelling narrative and cinematic beauty, but also for its brave confrontation of sensitive social issues. It undeniably fits the criteria of being one of the best films of the year, with its extraordinary depiction of the plight of Indian widows and their yearning for liberation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Confronted with evidence that key files were tampered with, the Government has reopened investigations into a possible cover-up involving suspected Nazi war criminals living in America. The investigations are being conducted by the Justice Department and the General Accounting Office. They concern allegations of a conspiracy to protect former Nazis and collaborators who may have been smuggled into the United States by American intelligence agencies for cold war operations against the Russians. Charges that the American authorities mishandled investigations of war criminals date back at least 10 years. But the G.A.O. concluded in 1978 that it could find no evidence of a conspiracy to impede the inquiries. Nearly 200 cases remain under investigation by a unit of the Justice Department, the Office of Special Investigations. Congressional investigators are also reviewing new information provided by a former prosecutor in that office, including long-secret military documents setting forth links that American intelligence agencies had with Nazis and their East European collaborators. Episodes described in the documents and other information collected by the former prosecutor, John Loftus, include these cases: - An Army officer working in intelligence after World War II acknowledged allowing some Nazi collaborators to falsify their applications for American visas in exchange for providing intelligence information. - Some former Nazis entered the United States through lightly patrolled Canadian and Mexican border crossings while others were routed through Argentina and other cooperative Latin American countries. - Other former Nazis arrived on cargo planes, after being listed on the waybills as freight. - One collaborator accused of killings was identified and barred from emigrating to America on five separate occasions by American counterintelligence agents. Yet with the help of other agents, he finally gained entry to this country. Mr. Loftus first made public on the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' last Sunday his charges that hundreds of Nazi collaborators were illegally brought into the country after World War II to form an anti-Soviet spy army. Masterminding the efforts, he said, was a highly secret covert operations agency close to the State Department called the Office of Policy Coordination. Mr. Loftus, who has written a book about his findings as a war crimes investigator, provided a draft of the book and documents to Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Immigration Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee. The book is tentatively scheduled for publication later this year. Mr. Loftus is now himself the subject of Justice Department inquiries into his disclosure of possibly confidential material, according to a department official. Mr. Loftus, now in private law practice in Boston, denied releasing any material not properly cleared by intelligence authorities. 'Just Provided Records' ''I just provided Congress records they were supposed to get four years ago,'' he said. In the reopened Government investigations, the Justice Department announced last week that its criminal division was looking into the removal, apparently by the Defense Department, of certain intelligence information from at least two files in military archives. The files were checked by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, as part of its conspiracy inquiry from early 1977 to May 1978. They dealt with two Byelorussian emigres under Justice Department investigation for atrocities in the Nazi-occupied region of western Russia. The two, Emmanuel Jasiuk and Franz Kuchel, have since died. The tampering was discovered a year later by Mr. Loftus, who found material that the accounting office later said it had never seen. Mr. Loftus also found a note in one of the files: ''Do not disclose to G.A.O. until notified to do so.'' The note was signed only ''General Counsel'' and the Justice investigation is aimed at learning where the directive originated. One Justice Department official said the Defense Department was queried months ago but had been slow in responding. Denials From Two Departments Both the Justice and State Departments denied last week that they had attempted to impede any investigation. The accounting office, basing its finding only on material it had been shown, concluded in May 1978 that no ''widespread conspiracy'' existed to frustrate investigations of people suspected of being war criminals. But it found that nine suspected war criminals had worked for and been paid by the Central Intelligence Agency or the State or Defense Departments. After the disclosure last week that the files had been tampered with, Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called on the accounting office to reopen its investigation and the office complied. ''It looks like we were misled,'' said John Tipton, the accounting office's senior evaluator who also headed the 1978 investigation. The withholding of the material from him last time, he said, ''would lead to the fact that there might be a conspiracy, yes.'' 'Started Making Our Contacts' Meanwhile, he said, ''We've already started making our contacts'' for the reopened inquiry. He called the task ''pretty big - big as hell'' but said he had no idea yet how long it might take.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that said \\"Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\"?  The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\".  Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels  vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and \\"added too much singing\\". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: \\"There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally. Again, I was probably wanting something else.\\"Judas Priest's \\"Dissident Aggressor\\" is the first cover version to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The feeling will come on gradually and may start to spread from your hands and feet up through your arms and legs. If your numbness, prickling, or tingling sensations do not have an obvious cause, such as sitting on your leg for too long or sleeping funny, you should talk to your healthcare provider.  If your feet are numb, it can change the way that you walk. Over time, the change can affect your body in other ways, such as causing foot deformities or pain from an uneven gait. You may also get blisters and sores around the affected areas of your feet because you cannot feel that you are walking unevenly. You may experience sharp, jabbing, throbbing, burning, or freezing pain caused from issues within your nerves and not due to an injury. If you’re experiencing pain for no reason, it could be neuropathy. Since your nerves are not responding properly to sensations, you may feel sensations more strongly than you did before. Although this is rare, it could mean that a light pat on the back feels painful to you, or that a hug ignites your pain receptors. If this is caused by neuropathy, it will likely be a recent development and not a lifelong issue with clumsiness. Consider if you’ve been bumping into doors and furniture more often lately, or if you’ve suddenly started to fall down or trip for seemingly no reason. When your motor nerves are affected by the neuropathy, you’ll experience muscle weakness and possibly paralysis because the nerve can’t appropriately communicate with your muscles. In late stages of neuropathy, you may have trouble moving around, picking things up, or even talking. If your autonomic nerves are affected, you may have trouble regulating your bodily functions. This includes telling your body to sweat when you get hot. Your body may not sweat as often, causing you to overheat. Though these symptoms alone could be caused by a variety of problems, if you have them in conjunction with other symptoms like numbness or pain, they may indicate neuropathy. Neuropathy causes nerve damage, so your nerves may not be able to send messages to your body to tell it when to go to the bathroom, when to process food, and when to stop those functions. It’s possible that you may experience the following symptoms:  Constipation Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Indigestion Problems urinating Erectile dysfunction in men Lack of vaginal fluid in women If you have neuropathy, your body may be unable to regulate your heart rate and blood pressure, so it won’t be able to respond to changes in your activity levels. Your heart rate may remain high even when you are not exercising, and your blood pressure can quickly drop, causing you to feel dizzy. If you have dizziness or lightheadedness along with pain or tingling, it could be neuropathy. The dizziness and lightheadedness may be worse when you sit down or stand up. Summary:","output":"If you start feeling numbness, prickling, or tingling in your hands and feet without any obvious reason, and it causes you pain, trouble walking, or issues with body functions, it might be neuropathy, which is a problem with your nerves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The movie opens with a car speeding along a dirt road. The woman driving (Jan Holden) is telling her boyfriend, Chris (Barry Lowe) to \\"Hold on, well get help soon, were coming to the main road.\\" He has a large dark blister on his face. He's delirious, grabs the steering wheel, and tries to run the car off the road. They enter a \\"T\\" intersection and nearly crash into the car Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Dunlevy) is driving. Quatermass gets out of his car and walks over to the other. He's very angry and shaken, but inquires about the burn on the man's face. The woman hands him some rock fragments and tells him they were responsible for the burn. She tells him they were in Winterton Flats for a picnic. Quatermass helps push the car back onto the road, when Chris bolts from the car. They wrestle him back into the car. Credits roll. (Note: The British Version is called Quatermass 2, while the American version of this movie was titled Enemy from Space.)At the Rocket project we see a building with a radar antenna mounted on the roof. Two operators are watching the screen. They notice scores of objects coming down slowly. They track the objects to one hundred miles north of their location. As they reset the equipment, Quatermass drives up. He notices the antenna setting and is very annoyed. He scolds Brand (William Franklyn) and Marsh (Bryan Forbes) for what he perceives as unauthorized use of the scanner.He tells Marsh and Brand that tomorrow none of them may have jobs. He gives Marsh the stone fragments and tells him to have them analyzed and classified. He apologizes to Brand and tells him that the moon project is to be cancelled. He outlines the project scope in front of a scale model--to build a colony on the moon. As he prepares to get in his car he points to the rocket ship on the launch pad and tells Brand, \\"Can you still bear to look at it? The sum total of our achievement up to now--one Rocket, crewless, untried.\\" He leaves for the rocket launch area. Brand returns to the radar room and notices more... Answer:","output":"Considering the movie plot provided, a possible question that could be generated is: \\"In the film, what is the significance of the rock fragments Jan Holden gives to Professor Bernard Quatermass, and how do they relate to the mysterious objects detected by the radar operators at the Rocket project?\\" This question delves into the central mystery of the narrative, as it ties together the seemingly unrelated events of Chris's burn from the rock fragments and the unusual activity detected by the radar operators at the Rocket project. The rock fragments provide an initial clue to the events unfolding in the story, suggesting a potential threat or unknown danger connected to Winterton Flats. Additionally, this question highlights the investigative aspect of Professor Quatermass's character, as he seeks to uncover the truth behind these occurrences. Lastly, the question encourages an analysis of the movie's themes and larger implications, as the plot revolves around the moon colony project and the potential dangers of space exploration, whether they are external threats or internal conflicts related to the project. Overall, this inquiry effectively encompasses multiple aspects of the story and would lead to a comprehensive discussion of the film's plot, themes, and characters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They are attracted to each other, and bond as if they had known each other for a long time. They marry and have two children, Ian (Josh Paddock) and Marie (Jessica Brooks Grant). Their idyllic life ends when the children die in a car crash. Life becomes difficult: Annie suffers a mental breakdown and the couple contemplates divorce, but they manage through their losses. On the anniversary of the day they decided not to divorce, Chris is killed in another car crash. Unaware that he is dead, and confused that no one will interact with him, Chris lingers on Earth. He sees Annie's attempts to cope with his loss and attempts to communicate with her, despite advice from a presence that this will only cause her more pain. When his attempts cause more sorrow, he decides to move on. Chris awakens in Heaven, and learns that his immediate surroundings can be controlled by his imagination. He meets a man (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) he recognizes as Albert, his friend and mentor from his medical residency, and the presence from his time as a \\"ghost\\" on Earth.

This will effectively satisfy our hunger and provide energy for our daily activities. Why option 2 is not ideal: Taking a nap for an hour (option 2) helps in resting our body and mind but does not address the fundamental cause of hunger, which is the need for nutrients and energy derived from food.

Would \\"They are generally used in fruit salad .\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"A melon baller, as its name suggests, is a tool used primarily for scooping melon into ball shapes. Usually made of stainless steel, this kitchen utensil commonly features a handle with a small, circular cup at the end, similar to a small ice cream scoop. While it's primarily used for melons like cantaloupe and watermelons, it can also be used on any soft fruit or vegetable, for example, papaya, mango, or even butter or ice cream for small, round shapes. The major application of a melon baller is to create ornamental pieces for food presentation, since the scooped out round balls of fruit or vegetable are visually attractive. These scooped pieces can be used for various purposes such as garnishing, in cocktails, or as part of a dessert. Saying \\"They are generally used in fruit salad\\" would be a reasonable answer, but it is not the only use for a melon baller. It can also be used to hollow out vegetables for stuffing, to core apples or pears, or to make uniform balls of dough for cookies or other baked goods.

Many games in the series give the player a powerful uppercut ability; its use is limited, and must be earned during matches, and has a star punch that can be obtained by hitting an opponent while taunting or at just the right time. Little Mac can also block, causing him to take minimal damage.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

Movie plot title: Dial M for Murder Movie plot: Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is a former tennis player who married Margot (Grace Kelly) partly for her money. To please his wife, he has given up tennis and now sells sports equipment. Margot once had a relationship with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), an American crime scriptwriter, but broke it off when he went back to the U.S. for a year.In time they stopped writing to each other, and when Mark returns to London she tells him that she burned all his letters but one. Margo explains to Mark that the letter was stolen by a blackmailer who demanded £50, so Margot payed by mailing the money to a pawn shop location as intended, but the money was never picked up and the letter was never returned. Mark tells Margo that he wants to tell Tony about them so she can divorce Tony so she and Mark can be together, but Margot refuses out of fear of hurting Tony's feelings.It is also revealed that Tony and Margot have made their wills, naming each other as beneficiary with assets and money totaling £90,000. For a year, Tony meticulously plans Margot's murder. She has no idea that Tony knows of her love for Mark. He has gone to great lengths to steal a handbag containing one of Mark's letters, and even assumed the role of the anonymous Brixton-based blackmailer to find out whether she would pay to have it back. (She did, but he asked for only £50 and she did not, of course, get the letter back.) He even watched them having a little farewell party, eating spaghetti with mushrooms in Mark's studio flat in Chelsea.Tony slyly withdraws small amounts of money for a year, collecting £1,000 in (used) one-pound (£1) notes, with which he plans to pay a contract killer.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Dial M for Murder,\\" the character who makes several conflicting statements is Tony Wendice (Ray Milland). Tony is a former tennis player who married Margot (Grace Kelly) partly for her money and now sells sports equipment. Throughout the plot, Tony exhibits manipulative and deceitful behavior to carry out his calculated plan to murder Margot. He demonstrates his cunningness by creating multiple false narratives and conflicting statements to cover up his true intentions. For instance, he poses as an anonymous blackmailer to find out if Margot would pay to get Mark's letter back. Despite asking for £50, he never returns the letter to her. Another example of Tony's conflicting statements is when he tricks Charles Alexander \\"C.A.\\" Swann (Anthony Dawson) into a murder-for-hire plot with the intent of killing Margot. Tony uses his knowledge of Swann's criminal past to blackmail him into participating in the plan. Furthermore, Tony is very secretive and hides his true motives from his wife, Margot. She is entirely unaware of his knowledge of her past relationship with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) and Tony's year-long plot to plan her murder. He is successful in maintaining an innocent facade, making conflicting statements when necessary, and skillfully manipulates people around him to execute his plans. In conclusion, the character who makes several conflicting statements in \\"Dial M for Murder\\" is Tony Wendice. He demonstrates deceitful and manipulative behavior to orchestrate the perfect murder plan against Margot for his personal gain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(Associated Press)      For the first time since 1983, the Dublin, Ohio-based fast food company is updating its logo in a move intended to signal its ongoing transformation into a higher-end hamburger chain.      Instead of the boxy, old-fashioned lettering against a red-and-yellow backdrop, the pared down new look features the chain's name in a casual red font against a clean white backdrop. An image of the smiling, cartoon girl in red pigtails floats above _ though this girl looks more vivid and not quite as childlike.      In an interview with The Associated Press, CEO Emil Brolick said the current logo had served the company well for the past three decades, but that it was time for an update. Still, Brolick said he was encouraged by consumer feedback in testing dozens of new logo variations over the past several months.      \\"When we pushed things too far, they very much reeled us back,\\" he said, noting that it showed just how attached people are to the brand.      It's only the fifth logo update since founder Dave Thomas opened the first Wendy's in 1969, and perhaps the most significant. The makeover comes as the chain known for its square burgers and chocolate Frosty shakes struggles to redefine itself in the face of intensifying competition from the likes of Panera Bread Co. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., which are seen as a step up from traditional fast food.      Wendy's push has intensified since Brolick came on as CEO about a year ago. In addition to raising perceptions about its food, Brolick is focusing on renovating outdated restaurants with a look that features natural lighting, flat-screen TVs and a variety of seating options, including cushy chairs in nooks.      The idea is to create a more inviting atmosphere where consumers feel they can relax. Starting in March, Wendy's says the updated logo will start appearing on newly built and renovated restaurants.      It's still far from clear whether Wendy's broader reinvention will succeed. But sales at its restaurants open at least a year have edged up for the last five quarters. Craig Bahner, the company's chief marketing officer, notes that all brands need to evolve.      \\"It's a tangible signal of change,\\" Bahner said.      The Wendy's name and original logo were inspired by founder Dave Thomas' daughter, whose real name is Melinda Lou (her siblings couldn't pronounce her name when they were younger, so they called her \\"Wenda,\\" which turned into \\"Wendy\\").      Thomas thought the name conjured the image of the wholesome hamburger restaurant he dreamed of opening.      In his book \\"Dave's Way,\\" Thomas recalls how the family dressed up Wendy, then 8 years old, in a blue-and-white striped dress for the opening of the first location. To make her pigtails stick out, they put pipe cleaners in her hair. That's roughly the image of the little freckle-faced girl in the logo.      In undertaking the redesign, the company realized there were three key elements that had to be preserved; the image of the little girl, the color red and the way the \\"Wendy's\\" font swerves up _ what executives call \\"the wave.\\"      In the new logo, Bahner notes that Wendy's pigtails peek out from the oval frame, bringing her forward and making her more dynamic. The logo will be part of the new restaurant design that Wendy's is looking to expand to its roughly 6,000 locations in North America.      Brolick has noted that the revamps \\"enhance all dimensions of the Wendy's experience\\" and that renovated locations see a 25 percent bump in sales. By 2015, Wendy's plans to have half its 1,425 company-owned locations updated.      Ultimately, Brolick wants the company to be seen as a \\"top-end\\" fast-food chain _ better quality than McDonald's, but perhaps not at the same level as Panera.      \\"Our goal is to be a five-star restaurant at a three-star price,\\" he said.      Building on the introduction of its sweet baked potato and Bacon Portabella Melt cheeseburger this year, the company is looking at introducing whole wheat buns and flatbreads. Brolick says those type of small adjustments can have a big impact on perceptions about the healthfulness and quality of the chain's food.      The changes are even extending to employee uniforms, which will be updated next year to have a more tailored look.      The early feedback is positive and Brolick says workers like them _ so much so that they even feel comfortable wearing them outside the restaurant.      ___      Follow Candice Choi at http://www.twitter.com/candicechoi ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||","output":"For the first time since 1983, Wendy's, the Dublin, Ohio-based fast food company, is updating its logo as part of its transformation into a higher-end hamburger chain.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the school Sir Alexander Mackenzie was principal of?  Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, \\"My first...

Spelt flour is indeed derived from spelt, which is a hexaploid wheat that has six sets of chromosomes. Spelt, scientifically known as Triticum spelta, is an ancient grain that has been cultivated for thousands of years. It is a relative of modern wheat, but it has different properties and nutritional qualities. Spelt flour has begun to gain popularity in recent times as an alternative to traditional wheat flour. It has a nutty and slightly sweet flavor, which makes it suitable for various recipes, including bread, pasta, and baked goods. The flour has a higher protein and fiber content compared to common wheat flour, contributing to its growing popularity among those seeking more nutritious alternatives in their diet. Furthermore, those with slight intolerance to wheat find spelt flour more digestible, as it contains a different type of gluten compared to modern wheat. However, it should be noted that spelt flour is not suitable for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance. In summary, the suggested answer correctly describes spelt flour as coming from a hexaploid wheat with six sets of chromosomes.

Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia. Arie Eddy, 18, has been struggling to find a job for almost three years and only managed to secure one job interview during that time. As youth unemployment continues to rise across Australia, more and more young people are struggling to find work. In Victoria the number of individuals under the age of 24 without work has hit a 15-year high, while in Queensland unemployment is also on the rise according to the ABS. Arie Eddy, from Warrnambool on the south-west coast of Victoria - about 260 kilometres from Melbourne, has been searching unsuccessfully for work for almost three years. 'It constantly makes me feel worthless. It makes me feel like I don't have any purpose and every day is hard to get through. I feel like I have no need to be around if I haven't got a job,' Arie told The Age. After leaving school in Hamilton at 16 to move south in search of a new life, the 18-year-old joined the military. However four months in he was forced out because he suffers from severe asthma. Victorian Council of Social Service chief executive Emma King told the publication the situation is also dire for graduates. 'They are continually told they don't have enough experience. We have a very competitive job market, they have done all the right things in terms of education,' she said. Over the past few years Arie estimated he'd applied for more than 780 jobs, but only secured one interview and remains unemployed. Youth unemployment rates are on the rise in many states, with the worst hit being Tasmania, followed by QLD. As a requirement of his youth allowance from Centrelink Arie must apply for 20 jobs each fornight, but so far it has been to no avail for the young Victorian. The Age report he receives 545 per fortnight from the government, but that is barely enough to survive once rent, bills, food, petrol amd asthma and depression medication are all taken care of. Arie said at least 30 of his friends are also struggling to find work, and his family in Hamilton are suffering financially too. While on youth allowance the government requires its recipients to apply for at least 20 jobs each fortnight. Now, after the hospitality course he was taking part in at TAFE was scrapped when funding was cut, he is considering following in his family's footsteps and getting into security. Arie's grandmother and aunts work in the industry and in six months time he will begin studying a Certificate II in security thanks to a course his employment agency has organised. With 95 percent of the cost taken care of, Arie is positive about the experience and hopes it will help turn his luck around and finally secure him a job. Despite Victoria's youth unemployment rates being at their highest in more than a decade, Tasmania is classified as the worst state for young people to find jobs. Queensland follows not too far behind. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Arie Eddy, an 18-year-old from Australia, has been trying really hard to find a job for almost three years, but it has been very difficult for him. Many young people in Australia, like Arie, are having trouble finding work, which makes them feel sad and worried. Arie has applied for lots of jobs, but he has only had one job interview. He gets some money from the government to help him, but it is not enough to take care of all his needs. Arie is now planning to study security so he can hopefully find a job in that field, just like some of his family members.

For example, nudge him a bit with your elbow during a conversation or touch his forearm a bit when you're speaking. If he touches back, it’s usually a sign he's interested in you as well. While you want the guy to know you’re interested in him, don’t do anything that you’re not comfortable with. If touching him feels like too much at first, just try standing close until you feel more comfortable. . Fit little compliments into the conversation. Make sure that you mean what you say, though, because he’ll probably be able to tell if you’re just giving him a line. Look for moments where you can work what you admire about him into a the conversation naturally.  When you first begin flirting, you can use somewhat generic phrases. For example, you might say, \\"It was so good seeing you yesterday!\\" As you get to know him more, work organic compliments into the conversation. For example, if he mentions that he's wondering what to wear to a sporting event over the weekend, you might something like, \\"You always dress really nice so I'm sure you'll find something great.\\" Smiling is a good way to come off as flirtatious. During a conversation, work on keeping a smile throughout. You can also try to laugh lightly at his jokes and smile more when he says something sweet or interesting. Eye contact can also help. Try holding his gaze for a few seconds and then glancing away. It may seem strange, but people are attracted to those who subtly mimic their body language. You don’t have to imitate everything he does, but mimic small, subtle gestures. For example, if you see him cross his legs, cross your legs too.  Try mimicking hand gestures. If he tends to wave his hands around as he speaks or to make a point, try doing the same. If he is leaning in towards you, lean in towards him too. You may want to send your guy a physical note, but a flirty text can also work. Don't make it outright flirty if you haven't established that kind of relationship, though. Just show that you're thinking of him.  For example, you might send a quick text that says, \\"Just wanted to say hi! ;)\\" You can also text or send a note with a quick question. For example, \\"How was your day?\\" Summary:","output":"To show a guy you're interested, you can try these small actions: gently touch him during conversations, give him genuine compliments, smile and laugh when talking with him, make eye contact and glance away, copy some of his small gestures, and send him friendly messages.

Many parents may even fail to recognize and respond to their children's need until discouragement explodes into uncooperative behavior. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects,the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school. Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain aim to provide all environment where gifted children can develop their skills under the guidance of professional musicians. Children here spend about half of a day on musical activities,for example,individual lessons,orchestras,chamber groups,voice training,conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practicing in private rooms .The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects:English,maths and basic sciences. What are the disadvantages?

To do this, add 371v to both sides of the equation: 2359v + 371v + 32388 = -371v + 371v - 21813 + 248031 This simplifies to: 2730v + 32388 = 248031 - 21813 Step 2: Simplify the equation. Subtracting 21813 from 248031 we get: 2730v + 32388 = 226218 Step 3: Isolate the variable v on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 32388 from both sides of the equation: 2730v + 32388 - 32388 = 226218 - 32388 This simplifies to: 2730v = 193830 Step 4: Solve for v.

Simplify both sides of the equation: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have two terms containing h (227*h and 20*h): 227*h + 20*h = 247*h The left side of the equation now becomes: 247*h + 4913 On the right side, subtract 2475 from 1213: 1213 - 2475 = -1262 Now, we have the equation: 247*h + 4913 = -1262 2. Isolate the variable h: To do this, we need to remove the constant term from the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4913 from both sides of the equation: 247*h + 4913 - 4913 = -1262 - 4913 Now, the equation becomes: 247*h = -6175 3. Solve for h: We now have a simple equation with a single term containing the variable h. To solve for h, we need to get h alone on the left side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 247: 247*h / 247 = -6175 / 247 Now, the equation becomes: h = -25 So, the answer to the given math problem is: h = -25"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake.  Question: suppose less cracks develop beneath the surface happens, how will it affect less stronger earthquakes.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"less effect. Explanation: Step-by-step thinking process: 1. Less cracks develop beneath the surface: If fewer cracks develop deep beneath the earth's surface, the amount of available space for the earth's crust to move and interact is reduced. 2. The cracks get very long and big in some places: With fewer cracks, the extent of long and big cracks will be limited, causing less movement and friction between rocks on both sides of the cracks. 3. The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks: As there are fewer cracks and less movement overall, the pressure exerted on the rocks will be reduced. 4. The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard: With less pressure being applied, the force with which rocks press against each other will be less intense. This means less potential for significant stress build-ups that would cause stronger earthquakes. 5. The cracks continue to develop: The development of cracks is limited in this scenario, so they may not develop as extensively, resulting in less interaction between the earth's crust along these cracks. 6. The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks: With less interaction between the earth's crust along the cracks, there will be less movement overall, reducing the likelihood of stronger earthquakes. 7. The pressure and movement around the cracks cause the rocks to crumble in some places: Since pressure and movement are less intense, there will be less crumbling of rocks. 8. A lot of energy is released: With less intense pressure and movement, the amount of energy released will be reduced, leading to potentially weaker earthquakes. 9. The energy causes seismic waves: With less energy being released, the seismic waves generated will likely be less intense. 10. The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake: As the seismic waves will be less intense, the resulting earthquakes will be weaker. To summarize, fewer cracks developing beneath the surface will lead to less pressure, less movement, less energy release, and ultimately less intense seismic waves. This will result in less severe earthquake events, or directly influence the second effect mentioned, i.e., the cracks getting very long and big in some places, by having a lessened effect on it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.  - In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Approximations employed. Two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the \\"actual\\" surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.  - Kirkbymoorside is a small market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, about north of York, midway between Pickering and Helmsley, on the edge of the North York Moors National Park.

In the narrowest sense of the word it consists of a flat plate (the \\"dial\\") and a \\"gnomon\\" which casts a shadow onto the dial. As the sun appears to move across the sky, the shadow aligns with different \\"hour-lines\\" which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day. The \\"style\\" is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or \\"nodus\\" may be used. The gnomon casts a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, a wire or an elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year. The style's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial's geographical latitude.  - The Howardian Hills take their name from the Howard family who still own local lands, and are located between the Yorkshire Wolds, the North York Moors National Park and the Vale of York.

This post came to me at 10pm last night, on Day 16 of this challenge, after a day of holidaying in London and with my head (and feet) too weary to put finger to touchscreen. Mrs Mc and I had just watched another live instalment of Broadchurch, murder mystery extraordinaire, particularly since in the second series there is no actual fresh murder to investigate. The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music. This moment has even gained a moniker in British homes, based on the theme tune to the real masters of the four-times-a-week cliffhanger, London-based soap opera Eastenders. It's call a \\"ba...ba...ba...ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba\\" (YouTube will provide overseas readers with auditory explanation). Eastenders is such a master of writing in the perfect pace that every 28 minute episode ends with a tantalising screen freeze on the latest shocked face / smirking baddy / confused victim.

To make a phone call Answer:","output":"Title: The Unspoken Truth Step 1: Set up the character's background Jim Stevens, a recently single middle-aged man, works as an investigative journalist. He has a habit of getting too deep into his stories, which led to the collapse of his marriage. Jim is sent on an assignment to investigate a string of mysterious disappearances in a small town. Step 2: Establish the setting Upon arriving in the small town, Jim checks into the Whispering Pines Motel. The motel is a secluded and rundown establishment with peculiar staff and a few eccentric guests. As he settles into his room, Jim starts to feel that something is off about the motel. Step 3: Introduce a subplot While investigating the town and conducting interviews, Jim meets a local woman named Sara. Their bond grows as they find comfort in sharing their personal trials and losses. Sara's sister was one of the victims of the unsolved disappearances, and together, they hope to find some answers. Step 4: Present the main conflict One night, Jim discovers a clue in one of the missing people's personal belongings, hinting at a potential connection between the motel and the disappearances. In need of a secure place to report this lead, Jim realizes he must leave the motel room to make a phone call to his editor back in the city. Step 5: Create tension and suspense As Jim steps out to make the call, he senses that he is being watched. He chooses a payphone far from the motel to ensure his privacy. During the call, his editor informs him that they've found a pattern of mysterious deaths connected to the motel dating back decades. Step 6: Climax Upon returning to the motel, Jim and Sara confront the motel owner about the disappearances. The owner initially denies any involvement, but as they press further, he snaps and confesses to being part of a secret cult that worships an ancient dark entity. The cult sacrifices motel guests to maintain their immortality and power within the town. Step 7: Resolve the plot Jim and Sara escape the motel and inform the local police about the cult's activities. A raid on the motel leads to the arrest of the cult members, rescuing several captive victims and putting an end to the disappearances.

Charles V (Spanish: Carlos; German: Karl; Italian: Carlo; Latin: Carolus; Dutch: Karel; French: Charles,  24 February 1500 - 21 September 1558) was ruler of both the Spanish Empire as Charles I from 1516 and the Holy Roman Empire as Charles V from 1519, as well as of the lands of the former Duchy of Burgundy from 1506. He stepped down from these and other positions by a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Through inheritance, he brought together under his rule extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas and Asia. In 1506, Charles inherited his father's Burgundian territories, most notably the Low Countries and Franche-Comte. Most of the holdings were fiefs of the German Kingdom (part of the Holy Roman Empire), except his birthplace of Flanders, which was still a French fief, a last remnant of what had been a powerful player in the Hundred Years' War. As he was a minor, his aunt Margaret of Austria (born as Archduchess of Austria and in both her marriages as the Dowager Princess of Asturias and Dowager Duchess of Savoy) acted as regent, as appointed by Emperor Maximilian until 1515. She soon found herself at war with France over the question of Charles' requirement to pay homage to the French king for Flanders, as his father had done. The outcome was that France relinquished its ancient claim on Flanders in 1528.  From 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the rebellion of Frisian peasants (led by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijard Jelckama). The rebels were initially successful but after a series of defeats, the remaining leaders were captured and decapitated in 1523.  Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of Tournai, Artois, Utrecht, Groningen and Guelders. The Seventeen Provinces had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were fiefs of either France or the Holy Roman Empire. In 1549, Charles issued a Pragmatic Sanction, declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs.  The Low Countries held an important place in the Empire. For Charles V personally they were his home, the region where he was born and spent his childhood. Because of trade and industry and the wealth of the region's cities, the Low Countries also represented an important income for the Imperial treasury.  The Burgundian territories were generally loyal to Charles throughout his reign. The important city of Ghent rebelled in 1539 due to heavy tax payments demanded by Charles. The rebellion did not last long, however, as Charles's military response, with reinforcement from the Duke of Alba, was swift and humiliating to the rebels of Ghent.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What happened after Charles got all these territories?","output":"After Charles V acquired all these territories, he worked on consolidating his rule over them. Through inheritance, he brought together extensive territories in western, central, and southern Europe, and the Spanish viceroyalties in the Americas and Asia. Charles issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs. This move aimed to make them a more integral part of his empire. However, the costs of fighting wars and maintaining territories strained his resources, leading to a series of abdications between 1554 and 1556. Ultimately, he divided his empire between his brother Ferdinand and his son Philip, with Ferdinand gaining the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Habsburg territories, while Philip received Spain, the Spanish Empire territories, and the territories in the Low Countries and Italy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The area of child psychology is one of the most significant and well studied of all the branches of psychology. It aims to help with achieving a greater understanding of the behavior of children through an understanding of their minds. It deals with children who range from the prenatal stage right up to the stage of adolescence. The psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980) has been credited with making a major breakthrough in this area when he put forward his idea that children were not actually less intelligent than adults, rather they just thought in a different way. Preciously the development of children right from birth through to adulthood was an area that was almost completely _ . In fact very little work was done in this area. However, interest in this field has now developed to the point of being one of the most debated of all the areas of psychology. Despite popular belief that factors such as genetics or personal characteristics are the only determining factors that influence a youth's behavior, this is not in fact the case. In reality, development actually includes many more factors than those contained within an individual. Factors such as environment, which can include social relationships and the surrounding culture, also play important roles. Relationships with both peers and adults will no doubt affect how children think and learn, and therefore develop. These relationships can include those that are found not only within families but also in schools and peer groups. Culturally speaking, this factor will contribute greatly to how children develop their personality concerning the values they end up holding (perhaps for a lifetime) as well as how they view such things as traditions and customs. Nowadays, psychologists have agreed that a child's psychology is both unique and highly complex. However, there are debates on many different points in this field and many viewpoints exist.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Tony Dorsett recalls a 1984 game against the Philadelphia Eagles when he was streaking up the field and an opposing player slammed into him. One helmet plowed into another. Dorsett's head snapped back, his helmet was knocked askew. \\"He blew me up,\\" Dorsett told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \\"I don't remember the second half of that game, but I do remember that hit.\\" Dorsett compared the hit to a freight train hitting a Volkswagen. These days Dorsett is worried about the cumulative effects of hits like the one Ray Ellis laid on him that day. In the past two years, Dorsett's memory has given him increasing trouble. On Monday, doctors at UCLA told Dorsett, 59, he has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, the Hall of Famer said. CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. The only way to definitely diagnose CTE is after death, by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau, which has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players. Opinion: Why I'm saying goodbye to football. However, a pilot study at UCLA may have found tau in the brains of living retired players. Some scientists say finding the disease in the brains of living players is the \\"holy grail\\" of CTE research, providing a means to diagnose and treat it, and the UCLA study may be an important first step. Using a scan called a positron emission tomography, or PET, typically used to measure nascent Alzheimer's disease, researchers inject the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body, crosses the blood-brain barrier and latches on to tau. Then, the players' brains are scanned. \\"We found (the tau) in their brains. It lit up,\\" Dr. Gary Small, professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and lead author of the study, said in February. Dr. Joseph Maroon, a neurosurgeon who works with the Pittsburgh Steelers, cautioned Thursday that the CTE diagnoses of Dorsett (and two other living former players) need further study. \\"This is very, very preliminary,\\" he told Sportsradio 93-7 The Fan in Pittsburgh. \\"There are many, many causes of dementia or progressive memory loss, particularly when you get over 60 or 70 years of age. ... It's something to obviously be concerned about, and the question is what can be done about it?\\" Dorsett said the diagnosis explains a lot about his forgetting where he is driving and his mood swings. \\"Memory loss, more so than anything it's been my big deal,\\" he said. \\"Sometimes you can have sensitivity to light and things like that. But my thing was not remembering. I've been taking my daughters to practice for years and all of a sudden I forget how to get there.\\" His daughters are afraid, he said. They wonder which father they will get. Will he be the happy dad or the one in a bad mood. For others known to have had CTE, symptoms include depression, aggression and disorientation. In 2002, Mike Webster, a Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After his retirement, Webster suffered from amnesia, dementia, depression and bone and muscle pain. What you need to know about concussions in the NFL. Unlike Webster, who spent his career smashing into opposition linemen many times a game and in practice, Dorsett was a superfast running back who made his enemies miss by darting past them or with a quick spin to avoid contact. He won the Heisman Trophy as college football's best player in 1976 and became an instant NFL star on the league's most popular team, the Dallas Cowboys. He played 11 seasons and gained 12,739 yards, eighth best of all time. His 99-yard run in 1982 is an NFL record. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994. Now he looks in a mirror and wonders. \\"And I say who are you? What are you becoming?\\" he said. \\"It's very frustrating to be a person that's been so outgoing, then all of a sudden, I'm like a couch potato.\\" Other athletes have demonstrated erratic behavior, such as Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, 36, who died in a 2004 high-speed chase. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry died at age 26 after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancÃ©e. Opinion: NFL takes good first step to protect players. Some who showed signs of the disease have taken their own lives, including former Philadelphia Eagles defensive back Andre Waters, who shot himself in 2006; Terry Long, a former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze; and Junior Seau, the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of 43. Dorsett said that won't happen to him. \\"I'm going to beat this. Trust me,\\" he said. Dorsett pins much of the blame for his health issues on team owners. He said a 765 million settlement of a concussion lawsuit with the NFL was not enough. \\"I can't put a price on my health. The owners knew (about the dangers of concussions) for years and they looked the other way, and they kept putting us players in harm's way.\\" The deal calls for the NFL to pay for medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to a court document filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case, which involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs. NFL concussion settlement raises questions. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article talks about Tony Dorsett, a retired football player, who shared his story about getting hit really hard during a game in 1984. He mentioned that he had trouble remembering things since then. Recently, doctors told him that he has a brain disease called CTE. This disease can happen when people have many head injuries over time and can cause memory loss and mood swings. A study at UCLA may have found a way to see this disease in living people's brains, which can help doctors understand and treat it better. However, more research is needed to make sure it's accurate. Some former football players with this disease have had depression, aggression, and other serious problems, but Tony Dorsett is determined to stay strong. He blames team owners for not doing enough to protect players from head injuries and thinks the money given in a recent lawsuit isn't enough. The article highlights the importance of understanding and preventing brain injuries in sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The clock on the dashboard reads 11:14 p.m. Suddenly, as he drives under an overpass, something smashes across the windshield, causing him to skid off the road. He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage, and finds a body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car. When he sees another car approaching, he panics and drags the body out of sight. The car pulls up next to him, and the driver, Norma (Barbara Hershey), assumes that he hit a deer. She offers to call the police over Jack's protests, insisting that it's no trouble because she has a new cell phone that she 'never uses' and because she is friends with the chief of police. Norma offers Jack a ride to her house to wait for the police, but he declines. When she drives off, Jack decides to hide the body in the trunk of his car. He gets back into the car to pull away, but a police officer pulls up behind him. Officer Hannagan (Clark Gregg) speaks with Jack, and noting his odd behavior, asks him if he would submit to a breathalyzer test. Jack requests a sobriety test instead, which Hannagan administers. When the officer checks with dispatch, he finds that Jack's license has been revoked for driving under the influence. Hannagan tells Jack that he is under arrest and that his car will be impounded. When he finds the body in the trunk, Hannagan handcuffs Jack with a cable tie and tells the 2 people already in the back of the cruiser, Duffy (Shawn Hatosy) and Buzzy (Hilary Swank), to move over so that Jack will fit.
