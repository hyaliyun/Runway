Passage:McNulty moved to Cork City in 2003, initially playing for the club's under-21 side in the Eircom U21 League. In 2005, he was promoted to the first team and made 3 appearances in the league, as City won the league title. McNulty made a further 24 league appearances over the next 4 seasons. In 2010, as Cork City were relegated to the First Division due to financial issues, McNulty established himself as City's starting goalkeeper, making 33 league appearances that season, as City finished in 6th place. He made 29 league appearances in 2011, as City secured promotion back to the Premier Division by winning the league. McNulty continued as City's first choice keeper, missing just 5 league matches in 2012 and 2013. Ahead of the 2014 season, John Caulfield was appointed as Cork City's manager. McNulty made 33 league appearances that season as City finished 2nd in the league to Dundalk. He played in all of Cork City's league matches over the next two seasons, as City finished 2nd to Dundalk on both occasions. McNulty also started the 2015 FAI Cup Final as City were beaten 1-0 after extra time thanks to a goal from Richie Towell. In the 2016 FAI Cup Final, McNulty again started the final, and was on the winning side this time, as Sean Maguire's goal in the last minute of extra time secured a 1-0 win for City. In 2017, McNulty played in all but one of City's league matches, as City won the league title. In the third successive cup final between Cork City and Dundalk, McNulty started the final and saved a penalty from Michael Duffy in a penalty shootout that City eventually won 5-3, after the match finished 1-1 after extra time, to secure a league and cup double for the first time in City's history.

The passage provided does not reveal his age at the time of his appointment as manager, so I will perform further research on the appropriate link to find the answer. Link choice: c. John Caulfield (Irish footballer) Upon researching more information about John Caulfield, I found that he was born on August 12, 1964. The passage states that he was appointed as Cork City's manager ahead of the 2014 season. Therefore, I need to calculate his age using this information. Calculating the age: August 12, 1964 - birthday 2014 season - year of appointment as a manager In 2014, John Caulfield turned 50 years old (2014 - 1964 = 50). Thus, he was 50 years old when he was appointed Cork City's manager. Output: 50"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Viděl jsem ho v neděli, a vypadal docela smutný. Which language is this?","output":"The sentence you provided is in the Czech language, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. The Czech language is closely related to Slovak and partially intelligible with Polish and other Slavic languages. Here is an English translation of the sentence: \\"I saw him on Sunday, and he looked quite sad.\\" The sentence structure, as well as the diacritical marks like the acute accents (e.g., ě), are characteristic features of the Czech language. Czech has a rich inflectional system, which means that its nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numbers, and verbs change their forms according to their role in a sentence (e.g., subject, object, or possessive). This allows for greater flexibility when it comes to word order, although the basic word order is subject-verb-object (SVO), just like in English. Czech also makes use of a particular set of consonants, called rhotic consonants. These include sounds represented by the letters 'r' and 'ř'. The latter (ř) is unique to Czech and is also known as a \\"voiced alveolar fricative trill.\\" It may be challenging for non-native speakers to pronounce it accurately. Additionally, the Czech language has seven cases in its grammar system: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. These cases indicate the function of a noun, pronoun, or adjective within a sentence, affecting the endings of the words. Understanding and using these cases correctly may also require practice and learning for non-native speakers. The Czech language has a rich literary tradition that goes back centuries, with several noteworthy authors, poets, and playwrights contributing to its cultural heritage. Some famous Czech authors include Franz Kafka, Jaroslav Hašek, Karel Čapek, and Milan Kundera."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

POST :  Alright, I know that this already sounds bad, but please hear me out: My wife and I consider ourselves to be animal lovers and have always talked about adopting a cat together. When we met, I already had two cats (both rescues, ~2 years apart). Let’s call them Fluffy and Snuffles. We decided to adopt another cat because they seem to really love hanging out and playing with each other, and are very passive/non-territorial. We went to the shelter, and picked out a cat that the employees said was very easygoing, chill and great with other cats. Let’s call him Diablo. When we got him home, we did all the proper introductions with the other two cats. Multiple litter boxes on different floors, got him his own room, let them sniff under the door first, etc. It quickly became evident that Diablo is NOT good with other cats. He constantly hisses and growls at Fluffy and Snuggles, and has commandeered all of their usual hangout spots/toys/etc. Like, we have three couches, and Fluffy and Snuggles used to really like chilling on one of them. Diablo immediately took it over and began biting at the others and hissing when they tried to play on that couch. When they tried a different couch, DIABLO WOULD FUCKING GET OFF THE COUCH HE WAS SITTING ON TO CHASE THEM OFF OF THE SECOND COUCH HE WASN’T EVEN USING. He also constantly tries to mark his territory by pissing everywhere. He does this constantly, even if there are no other cats around. He just sprays everywhere. We have taken him to multiple vets, and there’s not a medical issue or anything. He’s just aggressive and territorial. He also screams all night, to the point where I can’t sleep. At this point, I fucking despise Diablo. I would never abuse him or anything, but I have spent hours of my life scrubbing his piss out of our carpets, dealing with him biting me for looking at him wrong, and comforting Fluffy and Snuggles, who are now absolutely miserable and basically hide all the time. My wife feels bad for Diablo and keeps defending him, but at this point, I just want this cat gone. I know it’s not his fault because he’s just an animal, but I feel like he’s obviously NOT the right cat for our household. So, WIBTA if I insisted that we rehomed him?","output":"To determine if the claim is true or not, I will analyze the post to see if the author has already done something (HISTORICAL) or is considering doing something in the future (HYPOTHETICAL).

If \\"Many women have gathered and are listening to speakers.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Women disperse to go back to work.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"Many women have gathered and are listening to speakers\\" does not logically follow that \\"Women disperse to go back to work.\\" The initial statement simply provides information about an event where a group of women are present and attending a gathering involving speakers. The information given does not directly imply anything about what these women will do after the event or the reasons for their attendance. However, it is possible to infer that the women might disperse and return to their respective activities or jobs after the event. Still, this is an assumption and not a logical conclusion based solely on the initial statement. Multiple scenarios could take place after the event: 1. The women might disperse to go back to work if the event is during their work hours or if they have work-related commitments afterward. 2. They could continue with other social activities or gatherings related to the initial event, such as networking or further discussions. 3. The women could attend another event or conference, which could be either related or unrelated to the initial gathering. 4. They might go back home or to other personal engagements after the event. 5. The women might simply remain at the event location to continue discussions or spend some leisure time. In summary, the statement \\"Many women have gathered and are listening to speakers\\" does not logically or necessarily lead to the conclusion that \\"Women disperse to go back to work.\\" While it is possible for the women to return to work after the event, it cannot be determined as a logical consequence based on the information available.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the former prime minister who did not provide financial support for the leader of the Nimrod Expedition? , can you please find it?   Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\\"a bit of a floating gent\\". By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to... The answer to this question is:","output":"Rosebery.

I can use this background: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.  Now, I have a new situation: Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to begin exercising regularly. Michael took this advice to heart, and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Robert, on the other hand, only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks.  Answer this question please: Who is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries?","output":"Based on the information provided, Robert is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of his arteries. This is because he only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks, whereas Michael has been following the recommendation to exercise regularly every week. Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol (the \\"bad\\" cholesterol) and increase HDL cholesterol (the \\"good\\" cholesterol). By not exercising as frequently, Robert may have a higher risk of LDL cholesterol build-up, which can lead to atherosclerosis and potentially increase the risk of heart attack or stroke."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence with a missing word that can be an object, a person, and/or an action.

Write an article with the title: \\"For John Edwards, A Moment of Truth\\"","output":"Title: For John Edwards, A Moment of Truth Introduction In the fiercely competitive world of politics, it takes a combination of perseverance, timing, and a little bit of luck for any politician to find their moment of truth – the pivotal point where they either rise to prominence or fade into obscurity. For John Edwards, a former US Senator from North Carolina and two-time presidential candidate, that moment came during the 2008 presidential campaign. Though marred by controversy, it was an opportunity for Edwards to showcase his resilience and commitment to the values he epitomized. Early Career and Political Ascendance Born in 1953, John Edwards grew up in a modest, working-class environment that helped shape his worldview and political perspectives. After earning a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Edwards quickly gained recognition as a successful trial lawyer, advocating for victims of corporate negligence and malpractice. As his legal career provided him with a strong platform for public service, Edwards transitioned into politics, winning a North Carolina Senate seat in 1998. The young politician's charm, charisma, and genuine concern for the working class made him an instant Democratic Party star. His advocacy for affordable healthcare, the fight against poverty, and the expansion of educational opportunities resonated with many Americans. This catapulted him into the national spotlight, and Edwards found himself as the vice-presidential nominee alongside John Kerry in the 2004 US presidential election. Despite their loss to incumbent President George W. Bush, the political future seemed bright for John Edwards. 2008 Presidential Campaign and A Moment of Truth In the 2008 presidential election, John Edwards launched his second bid for the presidency, hoping to capitalize on his growing popularity and the momentum of the Democratic Party. However, the presence of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in the race overshadowed his efforts, despite Edwards' consistent efforts to remain a strong voice for average Americans. Controversy and scandal also threatened to derail his campaign as the media caught wind of an extramarital affair Edwards had while his wife, Elizabeth, fought breast cancer. However, in the face of adversity, Edwards remained committed to his message of economic equality, promising to keep fighting on behalf of the voiceless. This perseverance exemplified his determination to overcome the odds and continue in public service, despite the challenges. Ultimately, John Edwards' presidential campaign did not succeed, but it served as a vital moment of truth for him. By staying true to his beliefs and remaining persistent in the face of adversity, he demonstrated the qualities that made him such an influential figure in American politics. Aftermath and Impact on American Politics Edwards' political career eventually came to a halt, and he returned to his roots in law. However, his impact on American politics did not fade away entirely. His focus on economic inequality and healthcare reform laid a foundation for later Democratic politicians to build upon. Moreover, his insistence on remaining in the race amid personal scandal demonstrated the importance of resilience and addressing public issues regardless of one's personal life. By refusing to abandon his principles, even during the most challenging times, John Edwards cemented his position as an American political figure who deeply cared about the issues that mattered to the average citizen. Though his moment of truth may not have been as glorious as he hoped, it highlighted his unwavering resolve to serve and advocate for a progressive vision of America. Conclusion For John Edwards, his moment of truth during the 2008 presidential campaign was not marked by victory or defeat, but instead by the steadfast pursuit of the values he cherished. Despite personal controversy and political setbacks, Edwards maintained his position as a champion for social justice, healthcare reform, and economic equality. Though his political career waned, the legacy of his convictions will continue to shape the American political landscape for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Question: \\"Where are many Ashkenazi Jews from?\\"  Context: \\"A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort – that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. It is noteworthy that these Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Many Ashkenazi Jews are originally from various regions in Europe, including places like Poland, Russia, Hungary, and Lithuania, among others. Regardless of their place of origin, they can be grouped into the same genetic cohort due to their endogamy and adherence to certain marriage traditions, especially among Haredi Jews who often marry exclusively within their Ashkenazi Jewish community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His companion on this journey was none other than a domestic item — a refrigerator. The story began when Tony made a drunken bet with a friend at a party. The wager was that he would not be able to hitchhike around Ireland with a refrigerator within a month. Accepting the challenge, Tony set off on this peculiar mission in an attempt to prove his friend wrong and win £100. The book describes his encounters with numerous locals and the diverse experiences he had as he carted the refrigerator across the country. Throughout his trip, which lasted 30 days, Tony managed to hitch a lift with over 40 different drivers. Relying heavily on the kindness, generosity, and sense of humor of the Irish people he met, the comedian encountered a range of experiences.

Discontent with the Ploughman's Platter: The customer found the food quality to be subpar and not as described, specifically mentioning the cheese cubes' similarity to grocery store offerings and presence of only two orange slices. 3.

To increase her productivity she started writing a to-do list in a daily notebook and threw away her calendar because the  Choose your answer from: [i] calendar was daunting.. [ii] notebook was daunting..","output":"calendar was daunting. To increase her productivity, she started writing a to-do list in a daily notebook and threw away her calendar because the calendar was daunting. The calendar had become an overwhelming visual representation of her tasks, deadlines, and obligations. By constantly reminding her of everything she needed to accomplish, it was creating a sense of anxiety and stress that was more hindering than helpful. Switching to a daily notebook not only helped her avoid the intimidating sight of an overly packed calendar, but it also provided several other benefits. For one, the notebook offered greater flexibility in organizing her tasks and priorities. She could separate her to-do list into different categories, such as personal, work-related, and long-term goals. This made it easier for her to focus on one area at a time without feeling overwhelmed by unrelated tasks.  In addition to allowing for better organization, the daily notebook also encouraged her to break down tasks into more manageable steps. Instead of having a large, vague task looming over her on the calendar, she could write detailed action items in her notebook and cross each one off as she completed them. This approach gave her a greater sense of accomplishment and made her feel more in control of her workload. Despite the benefits of using a daily notebook for her to-do list, she discovered that it was important to implement some strategies to make it as effective as possible. Here are some tips that she found helpful in maximizing her productivity: 1. Prioritize tasks: By categorizing her to-do list items based on importance and urgency, she could focus on what truly mattered. This helped her avoid the trap of \\"busy work\\" and ensured she was making meaningful progress on her goals. 2. Set time estimates: Adding a time estimate for each task gave her an idea of how long it should take to complete, making it easier to plan her day and allocate time efficiently. 3. Review and update regularly: At the beginning and end of each day, she made sure to review her list and update it accordingly. This helped her stay on track, make necessary adjustments, and identify any patterns in her productivity. 4. Limit daily tasks: Setting a maximum number of tasks to focus on each day prevented her from feeling overwhelmed. This forced her to be more selective in her priorities and fully commit to what was most important. 5.

What is the difference between the feelings of affection, attraction, trust, intimacy, love, true love, lust, crush, infatuation, obsession, passion and compassion? Select from the following. (i) no. (ii) yes.","output":"(i) no While both questions aim to understand the distinctions between various types of interpersonal relationships and emotions, they are not identical in their scope or meaning.  The first question, \\"What is the difference between love and friendship?\\" specifically focuses on the distinction between these two types of connection. Love can refer to romantic love, which often involves deeper emotional connections, physical attraction, and a sense of commitment. Friendship, on the other hand, is a bond between two people based on mutual affection, trust, and support, without necessarily involving romantic feelings or a physical aspect. The second question, \\"What is the difference between the feelings of affection, attraction, trust, intimacy, love, true love, lust, crush, infatuation, obsession, passion, and compassion?\\", is more comprehensive, asking for clarification on a broader range of emotions and connections that people might experience in their relationships. Let's delve into each of these emotions and explore their differences: 1. Affection: This is a gentle feeling of fondness and liking towards someone. It is a foundational emotion for building connection and can be present in various types of relationships, including familial and platonic ones. 2. Attraction: This refers to the magnetic pull you feel towards someone, usually because of their appearance or personality. Attraction is common in romantic relationships but can also exist in friendships. 3. Trust: Trust is a confidence in someone's honesty, reliability, and loyalty. It is an essential component of healthy relationships, including friendships, romantic partnerships, and family bonds. 4. Intimacy: Intimacy is a close, personal connection shared between two individuals, which can be emotional, intellectual, or physical. It can exist within friendships but is often more profound and complex in romantic relationships. 5. Love: Love is a deep emotional attachment that goes beyond mere affection and attraction. It usually encompasses feelings of care, dedication, and a sense of belonging to one another. Love can be experienced with friends, family members, and romantic partners. 6. True love: This term usually refers to a pure, selfless, and unwavering love that transcends emotional fluctuations or external factors. Some people argue that it represents the ultimate form of love, but the concept varies across different cultures and belief systems. 7. Lust: Lust is a strong physical desire for someone, often driven by sexual attraction. While it can be present in romantic relationships, it is generally considered distinct from love because it doesn't necessarily involve an emotional bond. 8. Crush: A crush is a temporary, often light-hearted infatuation with someone. It is characterized by having romantic feelings and fantasies about the person, without the depth and commitment of stronger emotions like love. 9. Infatuation: Infatuation is an intense, short-lived passion for someone. It is often fueled by idealization and projection, without a deep understanding of the other person. Infatuation differs from love, which is typically more enduring and grounded in reality. 10. Obsession: An obsession is an unhealthy fixation on someone that can be all-consuming and interfere with your ability to think rationally. It is an extreme form of attraction that can have detrimental effects on both parties involved. 11. Passion: Passion is a powerful and often overwhelming feeling of enthusiasm, excitement, or energy directed towards someone or something. It can be present in both romantic and non-romantic contexts. 12. Compassion: Compassion is a sympathetic concern for the suffering or well-being of others. It is driven by empathy and a desire to care for or help alleviate their pain, and it generally extends beyond the boundaries of close relationships. In summary, these two questions are related but not identical, as the second query provides a wider exploration of emotions and connections compared to the first, which specifically focuses on love and friendship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer based on context: Painting has continued to be a prominent form of artistic expression in Danish culture, inspired by and also influencing major international trends in this area. These include impressionism and the modernist styles of expressionism, abstract painting and surrealism. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes De Tretten (1909–1912), Linien (1930s and 1940s), COBRA (avant-garde movement) (1948–51), Fluxus (1960s and 1970s), Junge Wilde (1980s) and more recently Superflex (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various art movements include Theodor Philipsen (1840–1920, impressionism and naturalism), Anna Klindt Sørensen (1899–1985, expressionism), Franciska Clausen (1899–1986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), Henry Heerup (1907–1993, naivism), Robert Jacobsen (1912–1993, abstract painting), Carl Henning Pedersen (1913–2007, abstract painting), Asger Jorn (1914–1973, Situationist, abstract painting), Bjørn Wiinblad (1918–2006, art deco, orientalism), Per Kirkeby (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), Per Arnoldi (b. 1941, pop art), Michael Kvium (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg Kærn (b. 1969, superrealism).

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the type of whale that can weigh up to 190 metric tons?  Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago.  Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that... Answer:","output":"Step 1: Read the paragraph to understand the context and gather information about whales. Step 2: Identify relevant information about the type of whale that can weigh up to 190 metric tons.

A:","output":"The country in the Middle East that France took control of after WW1 was Syria, including Lebanon. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the territories were divided among the Allied powers under various mandates.

However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that in addition to railways, the rail trail is also accessible by bicycles.

These stats are meant to overwhelm you into buying something more expensive, but you don't have to fall for it. You can safely ignore the following terms and words when shopping -- they are just sales tactics:  Refresh rates (anything above 120Hz is fine) Contrast Ratio Motion Rate, ClearMotion, TruMotion, etc. Viewing Angles Premium HDMI ports (all HDMI will look the same, no matter the port). HDR, or High Dynamic Range, is a newer color format meant to capture the greatest array of colors possible. The problem is that most sources (cable, Netflix, etc.) don't even send HDR quality color yet, so you'll likely notice little difference. That said, to better \\"future-proof\\" your TV, it might be a good option. Obviously, more color is better. That doesn't mean that this small uptick now, however, is necessarily worth the extra 2-300. Unless you love watching 3D movies, skip this feature. Most companies have already passed over them, quietly shuffling 3D TVs out of their inventory because consumers were largely unimpressed. Why? Because you need expensive glasses for every viewer, a 3D compatible player, and extra-expensive movies that cannot be played on non-3D players. So, unless you really want to recreate the home theater experience at any cost, skip this feature. All 3D TVs can play normal 2D movies. If you want the option, and money is no concern, you might as well go big for the 3D capabilities. Smart TVs have apps built in to show Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, and other popular internet videos. While this may seem appealing, there are so many other streaming devices you can get cheaply that Smart TVs are often redundant. If you already have a way to stream media, skip the extra cost of a Smart TV. You can get a Google Chromecast, Roku, Amazon FireStick, Apple TV, or video game system with all the same features for 40-200. They are really just a fashion statement, with no real bearing on picture quality or enjoyment. Some people even lobby that they are worse, making it harder for a large group to all enjoy the screen from multiple angles. Summary:","output":"When shopping for TVs, there are many terms and features, but you don't need to worry about all of them. Refresh rates above 120Hz are fine, and words like Motion Rate or ClearMotion are just sales tactics. HDR might be good for more colors, but it's not very important right now. 3D TVs need expensive glasses and movies, so you can skip them.

He was educated at La Martiniere Calcutta, and the St. Xavier's College of the University of Calcutta. His parents were both sports persons. Vece was a midfielder in the bronze medal-winning Indian field hockey team at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Context: The duo of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi were nicknamed the ''Indian Express''. Leander Paes' off-and-on partnership with Bhupathi drew constant media attention in their home country India. In the 2006 Asian Games, a loss to the Chinese Taipei team in the team event led Leander to question Bhupathi's commitment to Team India. He once stated in an interview that although he and Bhupathi are friends, he did not consider pairing with his former teammate. However, for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, they decided to play together for their country, and lost in the quarterfinals to the eventual champions Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka.  In 2011, the \\"Indian Express\\" pair won the doubles title at Chennai Open. They reunited to play in a Grand Slam Tournament after nine years and claimed runners-up in the 2011 Australian Open and reached the semifinals in the year-end championships.  The Indian duo has a 303-103 career record together. They have a higher success rate against various top teams. They have a Davis Cup record of longest winning streak in doubles, with 24 straight wins.  Leander Paes was paired with Vishnu Vardhan at the London Olympics 2012, following the refusal of Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna to play with him at the Olympics. Paes threatened to withdraw from the Olympics rather than play with Vardhan, whose world ranking was 296, but withdrew the threat a week later.

Answer the following question: Question: If a coup-de-etat happens with hopes of changing society, what is called for?  Choices:  - happiness for - new laws - protest - change in leadership - cultural revolution  The rationale to choose \\"cultural revolution\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"A coup-de-etat refers to the sudden, often violent overthrow of an existing government by a small group, with the aim of either installing themselves as the new ruling power or installing a new political group that aligns with their ideologies. The primary goal of those instigating a coup-de-etat is often to replace the existing regime with one that will establish different political, economic, or social policies. Within the context of the given choices: 1. Happiness for all: While a coup-de-etat might bring some level of happiness or satisfaction to certain groups of people, happiness alone isn't the sole purpose of undertaking such a drastic action. Happiness is too vague and subjective a term to clarify the specific objectives of the group orchestrating the coup. 2. New laws: While a coup-de-etat often leads to the establishment of new laws, these changes are usually the result of the broader societal shifts that occur after the regime change. It is important to note that merely changing laws without addressing the deeper issues within society does not guarantee meaningful or enduring transformation. 3. Protest: Protests are generally non-violent means of expressing dissent against existing policies or government actions. They differ fundamentally from a coup-de-etat, which is a more forceful and usually violent attempt to overthrow a government entirely. 4. Change in leadership: A coup-de-etat obviously involves a change in leadership. However, this choice falls short of fully capturing the extensive depth and breadth of changes that accompany most successful coups. 5. Cultural revolution: This choice best describes the ultimate goal of a coup-de-etat that is intended to change society. A cultural revolution indicates a series of profound and far-reaching changes in a society's political, economic, and social structures, as well as its norms, values, and belief systems. It signifies a period of transformation in which every aspect of life is expected to shift, leading to the establishment of new values, institutions, and modes of behavior. It is a comprehensive and radical process that goes beyond superficial changes in leadership and lawmaking and targets the fundamental fabric of society. Given the explanation provided above, \\"cultural revolution\\" is the most appropriate choice to describe what is called for when a coup-de-etat happens with hopes of changing society. It encapsulates the broader implications and the transformative nature of the event that goes beyond simply altering specific policies and leaders, and encompasses a complete overhaul of societal paradigms and structures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Goal: blade Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"To provide a detailed response to your query, it's important for us to understand the context in which the term \\"blade\\" is being used. The term can be applied to various fields such as creating a knife blade, designing a propeller blade, or even referring to installing a blade server. Furthermore, it is essential to identify specific methods you might be referring to for accomplishing the goal. In this response, I will address three different aspects of blades and their manufacturing techniques and methods. 1. Knife Blade: If your goal is to create a knife blade, two main methods can be generally considered: stock removal and forging. Stock Removal Method: This is where the blade maker starts with a piece of steel and removes the unwanted material to shape the blade. This can be achieved using various techniques from hand tools (such as files and abrasives) to modern machine tools (such as milling machines and CNC machines). This method is more reasonable if you are looking for precision, control over the design, and versatility in using different materials. Forging Method: This involves heating the metal to a malleable state and shaping the blade by hammering, bending, and pressing. Blacksmiths often use this method, but it requires a high skill set, specialized tools, and safety precautions. Forging is ideal for achieving unique designs and shapes, as well as enhanced durability in specific scenarios where the forging technique aligns the metal's grain structure. 2. Propeller Blade: Should you intend to design a propeller blade, the focus will be on generating lift and thrust based on the blade's shape, profile, and materials. The methods used to create propeller blades are: A. Casting Method: In this method, the blade is produced by pouring molten metal into a mold replicating the desired shape. This method is commonly used for smaller and less complex blades made from brass, aluminum, or bronze. B. Milling and Machining Method: In this approach, the blade is shaped using various machine tools, such as milling machines or CNC machines, to remove material and achieve the desired profile. This method provides precise control over the blade's profile and allows the use of a greater range of materials, including stainless steel, aluminum, and composite materials. 3. Blade Server: The goal related to this term revolves around installing, configuring, or maintaining blade servers. In this situation, two common methods help achieve the goal. A. Manual Installation and Configuration: A system administrator would physically install the blade server hardware (the blade server chassis and individual blade components) and configure it by following the manufacturer's guidelines. This will involve integrating the new blade server into the existing network infrastructure and installing the desired software and operating systems. This method is adequate for small- to medium-sized installations or when specific customizations are needed. B. Automated Deployment and Configuration: In the case of larger installations or a need for standardized configurations, tools such as PXE (Preboot eXecution Environment) or configuration management systems like Puppet, Chef, or Ansible are used. These tools help automate the process of installing and configuring blade servers, which can reduce human error and significantly improve and streamline data center management. To summarize, the method that's most reasonable for accomplishing the goal depends on the context in which the term \\"blade\\" is being used and the specific manufacturing methods mentioned. In terms of knife blades, the stock removal method offers more precision and versatility. When designing a propeller blade, a balanced approach using casting or machining (depending on blade complexity and material) is reasonable. Finally, when installing a blade server, automating the deployment and configuration process is beneficial for larger data centers or when standardization is desired."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the scenario, Sean has returned home from grocery shopping and is putting his groceries away before using his computer. Let's go through the options one by one: - Mug: While it is possible to put a teabag in a mug if Sean were about to make tea, the context provided is about storing groceries away, not immediate use. Therefore, it is unlikely that Sean would have put the teabags in a mug. - Refrigerator: Generally, teabags do not require refrigeration. They are best stored in a cool, dry place. Therefore, it is unlikely that Sean would store his teabags in the refrigerator. - Teapot: A teapot is used for brewing tea, not for storing teabags. It is where you put the teabags when you are preparing the tea, along with hot water. So, it does not seem like a suitable place for Sean to store his teabags after grocery shopping. - Internet cafe: This option is not relevant to the question, as an internet cafe is a public place where individuals go to access computers and the internet, and it is not a place to store groceries. - Cupboard: Out of the given options, this is the most suitable and logical place for Sean to store his teabags. Cupboards are used for storing groceries, and it is common to store non-perishable items such as teabags in cupboards.

Dreams of rocking six-pack abs and a chiseled chest are achievable with dedication, hard work, and a consistent, disciplined approach towards your diet and workout regimen. Building the body of a male fitness model may be a long process, but the rewards are worth the time and effort. Here, we offer a comprehensive guide on how to work out like a beast, embrace a healthy lifestyle, and stay motivated every step of the way to become the ultimate male fitness model. 1. Develop a rock-solid workout routine Working out like a beast means pushing yourself to the limit. A well-crafted workout plan includes a mix of resistance training, endurance exercises, and flexibility workouts for a balanced physique. - Resistance Training: Strength training is crucial for building muscle mass and enhancing your metabolism. Incorporate compound exercises, such as deadlifts, squats, bench presses, and pull-ups, that target multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Isolation exercises like bicep curls, tricep extensions, and leg curls should complement your compound movements for a well-rounded program. Aim for 3-5 sets of each exercise, with 8-12 repetitions for optimal muscle development. - Endurance Exercises: While building muscle is paramount, don't neglect the importance of cardiovascular health. Torch calories and increase your stamina with regular HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) sessions, plyometrics, or running to boost your overall fitness. Aim for at least 3 sessions of cardio per week to reap the benefits. - Flexibility Workouts: As a fitness model, good posture and healthy joints are key, so include flexibility and mobility training in your routine. Yoga, Pilates, or simply a post-workout stretch can help maintain a full range of motion and prevent injuries by keeping your muscles and joints supple and healthy. 2. Clean up your diet Eliminate processed junk food and nutrient-deficient snacks from your food intake. Instead, focus on clean, whole foods that fuel your body and help build muscle mass. - Protein Power: Aim for a diet rich in lean protein, such as chicken, turkey, fish, and low-fat dairy, as an essential building block for muscle tissue growth and repair. - Carb Control: Quality carbohydrates like whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables offer essential energy for workouts and recovery. Opt for slow-digesting options to keep you full longer and prevent unwanted fat storage. - Fats: Not all fats are created equal. Emphasize healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, found in nuts, avocados, and olive oil. Avoid saturated and trans fats found in fried, processed, and fast foods, which can contribute to cardiovascular issues and unwanted weight gain. - Hydration: Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day – approximately 13 cups for men and 9 cups for women – to support vital functions, including digestion, absorption, circulation, and temperature regulation. 3. Prioritize recovery Sufficient sleep and rest are essential for optimal performance and muscle growth. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep every night to give your body time to repair and rejuvenate. Furthermore, schedule active rest days in your weekly routine, where you perform low-intensity activities like swimming, stretching, or leisurely walking, to support recovery and prevent overtraining. 4. Stay motivated and committed Consistency is king when it comes to realizing results. Don't give up when you hit a plateau or face setbacks. Stay driven by setting measurable, achievable goals and taking progress photos to visualize your accomplishments. Networking with a fitness community and surrounding yourself with like-minded people can also help maintain motivation. Conclusion Unleashing your inner beast and transforming your body into a male fitness model is no small feat, but the rewards are undeniably incredible. Embrace a healthy lifestyle, commit to a solid workout plan, and practice persistence. In time, you'll build the rock-hard physique you've always dreamt of and become the person you were meant to be. So gear up, take action, and dare to be extraordinary!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Teachers have banned parents from attending a school sports day in case it leads to a 'Hillsborough-style crush' on the playing field, it has been claimed. The bizarre ruling was enforced at Glapton Academy primary school in Clifton, Nottinghamshire, this week. Headteacher Ruth Ellis wrote to parents telling them they were not invited to next month’s event, which includes the traditional egg and spoon race, because of 'rising pupil numbers'. Furious: Lisa Darby (right) and other mothers are unhappy they have been banned from Glapton's sports day. The school claimed an increase in the number of parents wanting to cheer on their children could cause a crush on the playing fields. Some parents even say they were told the school implemented the ban in order to 'avoid another Hillsborough'. The newsletter to parents sent on Monday stated: 'Thursday 3rd July is planned for sports day. 'Unfortunately, due to rising pupil numbers, we will not be able to invite parents to sports day this year.' Yesterday, furious parents blasted the decision branding it 'health and safety gone mad'. Crowd control: The bizarre ruling was enforced at Glapton Academy primary school in Clifton, Nottinghamshire. David Elliott, 35, whose six-year-old son attends the school, said: 'This is bonkers. Simple as that. 'We got a letter from school saying parents would not be invited to this year’s sports day. 'I rang the school up and spoke to someone who said it was because of health and safety. 'I asked what that meant and the woman said it was because there were more pupils at the school and therefore more potential parents coming on sports day. 'When I asked what the school was afraid might happen she said there was a potential for a crush. I said \\"what like Hillsborough?\\" sort of as a joke, and she said \\"yes\\".' 'I was gobsmacked. I’ve never heard anything do ridiculous in my life.' The school claims an increase in the number of parents could cause a crush on the playing fields (pictured) Other parents threatened to boycott the sports day on July 3 in protest at the ban. Vicky Samson, 32, whose two children Elliott, 11, and Daisy-May, five, go to the school, said: 'I’m not happy about this at all. 'If we can’t watch, then my children will not be taking part in the sports day. 'My son is in Year 6, so it will be his last sports day - I really want to see him compete. 'The sports day is held on a massive field as well and it’s never full. 'They manage to cram all the parents into a school hall, but apparently we won’t be able to watch on the huge field.' Lisa Darby, 32, whose six-year-old daughter Libby is in Year 1, added: 'I was absolutely fuming when I read the letter. 'Sports day should be a family event and parents should be able to share their child’s excitement at taking part in all the races. The primary school became an academy in January 2013 and was rated 'good' by Ofsted in its last inspection. 'It’s also a big part of growing up - I remember having my parents there at every sports day when I was a child. 'They even used to take part in things like the egg-and-spoon race.' Ms Darby said she was allowed to attend every sports day when her older daughter Chloe, 13, was a pupil at the school. She added: 'It just seems really unfair on Libby now, that she can’t have her mum and dad there like Chloe did. 'I just can’t understand the decision. It seems a big enough sports field to me and I don’t think there are more pupils there than last year.' 'When you’re a working parent, it’s hard to get involved in school life, so you have to take every opportunity you can' Manda Wilkinson, 26, mother. Manda Wilkinson, 26, said her son Logan, eight, was upset to learn his parents wouldn’t be able to cheer him on. She said: 'I find it disgusting that the school aren’t giving us the choice over whether we want to come or not. 'When you’re a working parent, it’s hard to get involved in school life, so you have to take every opportunity you can. 'Are they going to stop us watching the Christmas plays next?' The primary school, which only became an academy in January 2013, was rated 'good' by Ofsted in their last inspection in June last year. Inspectors reported that the school - which caters for boys and girls aged between 3-11 - had 318 pupils on the roll, an increase from 284 who attended in 2010. The teachers’ union NASUWT also hit out at Glapton Academy, blaming their new status for the decision. Neil Lawrence, secretary of the union in Nottingham, said: 'The decision to ban parents from sports day is another example of the loss of control the community feels when a local school becomes an academy and withdraws from local authority control. 'Decisions are made arbitrarily and without consultation.' 'Safeguarding our children is our main priority' Nick Ydlibi, chair of governors. Roger Steel, Conservative Nottingham City Councillor for the Clifton North ward, added: 'It’s traditional that parents attend sports days and I can’t see any logic behind restricting them. 'There’s a benefit to both the children and the parents, who are proud to see their youngsters getting fit through sport.' The Association for Physical Education has also criticised the school’s decision. Spokesman Eileen Marchant said: 'Schools always have reasons for making decisions but it’s a shame this school hasn’t made public its reasons. 'Parents always enjoy going to school sports days and it’s important to have them there to encourage the children. 'So much investment has been put into primary schools through the Government’s PE and school sport premium. 'One of the things schools are expected to do with this is increase competitive opportunities for children. Sports day would be an ideal opportunity to showcase how they are achieving this.' However, Nick Ydlibi, chairman of governors, said: 'No parent has contacted the school to comment on the matter of us being 'unable to invite' parents to our sports day this year. 'Safeguarding our children is our main priority. We feel that due to the rise in pupil numbers along with the close proximity of current major road and tram works a lot of strangers are in and around our school locality. 'Because of this it would be extremely difficult for us to guarantee the safety of our children at an outdoor event with open gates; this is why this year, this very difficult decision has had to be made. 'Our school offers parents lots of opportunities to come to special indoor events, such as Glapton’s Got Talent, our Art Gallery, and Show Time events which are happening in June and July.' The Hillsborough disaster happened on April 15, 1989, at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield during a match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. A human crush resulted in the deaths of 96 people and injuries to 766 others. The incident has since been blamed primarily on the police for letting too many people enter the stadium and remains the worst stadium-related disaster in British history and one of the world's worst football disasters. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"A school has decided that parents cannot attend the school sports day because there are too many people and they are worried that there may be a crush, which means when too many people are in one place and cannot move, just like what happened during a sad event called Hillsborough. The parents are very upset and think this decision is silly because the sports day is held in a big field and they do not think there will be too much crowding. The school believes that their main job is to keep the children safe and they are taking extra precautions due to the large number of students and other construction work happening nearby."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

[c]. no.","output":"[a]. Yes. Based on the premise provided, the hypothesis can be concluded as true if the premise is true. Here's the detailed explanation: Premise: A young adult is throwing a softball to home base. This premise indicates that a young adult is performing an action of throwing an object, which in this case, is a softball. The intended target for the throw is home base. Hypothesis: A person throws a ball. The hypothesis is a simplified and generalized version of the given premise. Instead of referring to a \\"young adult,\\" the hypothesis uses the broader term \\"person.\\" Additionally, the hypothesis does not specify the type of ball being thrown (\\"softball\\" in the premise) or the target (\\"home base\\" in the premise). However, the core action of \\"throwing a ball\\" remains the same in both the premise and the hypothesis. Now let's evaluate the hypothesis and its relation to the premise. The premise clearly states that a young adult (a person) is throwing a softball (a ball) to home base. This statement satisfies the hypothesis, as a person is involved in the action of throwing a ball. The fact that the person is a young adult and the ball is a softball does not negate the hypothesis, as these details do not change the overall action.

(D). a core of electrons and neutrons surrounded by protons.","output":"The best description for an atom among the given choices is (C). a core of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons. An atom is the basic unit of matter that consists of three types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles have different properties and are organized in a specific manner within the atom.  Protons are positively charged particles found in the nucleus, which is the central part of the atom. Neutrons are neutral particles, having no charge, and they are also located in the nucleus along with protons. The protons and neutrons together are referred to as nucleons, and they account for almost all of the mass of an atom. The number of protons in an atom, also known as the atomic number, determines the type of element it represents. Surrounding the nucleus is a cloud of electrons, which are negatively charged particles. Electrons are much smaller and lighter than protons or neutrons, and they orbit the nucleus at various energy levels, called electron shells or orbitals. The distribution of electrons in these orbitals follows specific rules and patterns, with each shell having a certain capacity for holding electrons. The electric charges on protons and electrons are responsible for the way they interact with one another, and these interactions are critical in determining the chemical properties of elements and compounds. The electrons in the outermost shell, known as valence electrons, are particularly important for chemical reactivity, since they are the ones that participate in chemical bonds with other atoms. In summary, an atom consists of a nucleus made up of protons and neutrons at its core and is surrounded by electrons, which circulate in specific energy levels around the nucleus. Therefore, choice (C) accurately describes the structure of an atom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information:  - Operation Banner was the operational name for the British Armed Forces ' operation in Northern Ireland from August 1969 to July 2007 . It was initially deployed at the request of the unionist government of Northern Ireland to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) . After the 1998 Belfast Agreement , the operation was gradually scaled down . Its role was to assert the authority of the government of the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland . The main opposition to the British military 's deployment came from the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) . It waged a guerrilla campaign against the British military from 1970 - 97 . An internal British Army document released in 2007 stated that , whilst it had failed to defeat the IRA , it had made it impossible for the IRA to win through violence , and reduced substantially the death toll in the last years of conflict .  - The War Office was a department of the British Government responsible for the administration of the British Army between the 17th century and 1964, when its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Defence.  - The Royal Ulster Constabulary was the police force in Northern Ireland from 1922 to 2001. Following the awarding of the George Cross in 2000, its formal title became the Royal Ulster Constabulary, GC. It was founded on 1 June 1922 out of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). At its peak the force had around 8,500 officers with a further 4,500 who were members of the RUC Reserve. During the Troubles, 319 members of the RUC were killed and almost 9,000 injured in paramilitary assassinations or attacks, mostly by the Provisional IRA, which made, by 1983, the RUC the most dangerous police force in the world in which to serve. In the same period, the RUC killed 55 people, 28 of whom were civilians.  - The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom. The force was initially administered by the War Office from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence. The professional head of the British Army is the Chief of the General Staff.  - Ulster (or \\"Cúige Uladh\\" , Ulster Scots: \\"Ulstèr\\" or \\"Ulster\\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland. In ancient Ireland, it was one of the fifths ruled by a \\"rí ruirech\\", or \\"king of over-kings\\".  - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers.  - Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people in need. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency.  - The Good Friday Agreement (GFA) or Belfast Agreement (or ; Ulster-Scots: \\"Guid Friday Greeance\\" or \\"Bilfawst Greeance\\") was a major political development in the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s.   - The government of Northern Ireland is, generally speaking, whatever political body exercises political authority over Northern Ireland. A number of separate systems of government exist or have existed in Northern Ireland.   - The Northern Ireland Act 1998 (c.47) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which established a devolved legislature for Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Assembly, after decades of direct rule from Westminster.  - The Northern Ireland Assembly (Ulster Scots: \\"Norlin Airlan Assemblie\\") is the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the Northern Ireland Executive. It sits at Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast.  - The George Cross (GC) is the second highest award of the United Kingdom honours system. It is awarded for gallantry \\"not in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces and to British civilians. It has always been able to be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians including police, emergency services and merchant seamen although no British civilian has received the award since 1976. Many of the awards have been personally presented by the British monarch to both recipients and in the case of posthumous awards to next of kin. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - A paramilitary is a semi-militarized force whose organizational structure, tactics, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional military, but which is not included as part of a state's formal armed forces.  - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.  - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Troubles is the common name for the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it is sometimes described as a \\"guerrilla war\\" or \\"low-level war\\". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday \\"Belfast\\" Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mainly took place in Northern Ireland, violence spilled over at times into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England and mainland Europe.  - A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing.  - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area.  - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare.  - The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC, Irish: \\"Constáblacht Ríoga na hÉireann\\"; simply called the Irish Constabulary 183667) was the armed police force of the United Kingdom in Ireland from the early nineteenth century until 1922. A separate civic police force, the unarmed Dublin Metropolitan Police controlled the capital, and the cities of Derry and Belfast, originally with their own police forces, later had special divisions within the RIC. About seventy-five percent of the RIC were Roman Catholic and about twenty-five percent were of various Protestant denominations, the Catholics mainly constables and the Protestants officers. The RIC's successful system of policing influenced the armed Canadian North-West Mounted Police (predecessor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), the armed Victoria Police force in Australia, and the armed Royal Newfoundland Constabulary in Newfoundland. In consequence of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the RIC was disbanded in 1922 and was replaced by the Garda Síochána in the Irish Free State and the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.    What is the relationship between 'operation banner' and 'the troubles'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Operation Banner was the operational name for the British Armed Forces' operation in Northern Ireland from August 1969 to July 2007. It was deployed to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in maintaining law and order, and to assert the authority of the UK government in Northern Ireland. The main opposition to the British military's deployment came from the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), which waged a guerrilla campaign against the British military from 1970-97. The Troubles is the common name for the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century, which started in the late 1960s and is usually considered to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The conflict mainly took place in Northern Ireland, but violence occasionally spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England, and mainland Europe. Thus, the relationship between Operation Banner and the Troubles is that Operation Banner was the British military's response to the violence and unrest during the Troubles. The operation aimed to maintain stability, support the government and law enforcement, and counteract the activities of paramilitary groups like the IRA."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, there are -9 and +9 on the left side, which cancel each other out: -286*j = 9*j Step 2: Move all terms with j to one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 286*j to both sides: -286*j + 286*j = 9*j + 286*j This simplifies to: 0 = 295*j Step 3: To solve for j, divide both sides of the equation by 295: 0/295 = 295*j/295 This simplifies to: 0 = j So, the solution for the equation -286*j - 9 + 9 = 9*j is j = 0."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday. The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center. A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported. The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash. But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported. Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash. The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people. The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt. Then the out-of-control plane skidded and bounced at least three times as it careered 1,200 meters (3,840 feet) across uneven terrain and exploded, coming to rest in a gully, a top official of the investigative commission told a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday. Many of the bodies were badly charred from the fire, and authorities have used DNA samples to carry out numerous identifications.

Wallenstein is the popular designation for a trilogy of dramas by German author Friedrich Schiller. It consists of the plays Wallenstein's Camp , a lengthy prologue, The Piccolomini , and Wallenstein's Death . Schiller himself also structured the trilogy into two parts, with Wallenstein I including Wallenstein's Camp and The Piccolomini, and Wallenstein II consisting of Wallenstein's Death. He completed the trilogy in 1799. In this drama Schiller addresses the decline of the famous general Albrecht von Wallenstein, basing it loosely on actual historical events during the Thirty Years' War. Wallenstein fails at the height of his power as successful commander-in-chief of the imperial army when he begins to rebel against his emperor, Ferdinand II. The action is set some 16 years after the start of the war, in the winter of 1633/1634 and begins in the Bohemian city of Pilsen, where Wallenstein is based with his troops. For the second and third acts of the third play the action moves to Eger, where Wallenstein has fled and where he was assassinated on 26 February 1634. How many years after Wallenstein was assassinated was the trilogy completed?","output":"To determine how many years after Wallenstein was assassinated the trilogy was completed, we need to find the difference between the year of completion of the trilogy and the year of Wallenstein's assassination. 1.

Article: TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Florida health officials confirmed Thursday in their daily report that 84 pregnant women have tested positive for the Zika virus in the state.      Doctors who spoke at a \\"Zeroing in on Zika: From the Front Lines\\" forum Thursday said they have asked each woman to go public about their diagnosis and discuss their concerns, but only one has agreed to do so.      The University of Miami is taking a leading role in dealing with the Zika virus outbreak, launching the Zika Global Network.      Doctors said they expect to see an influx of Florida babies born to mothers who contracted the virus in about five or six months.      The forum came a day after doctors confirmed that a baby was born with microcephaly at Jackson Memorial Hospital.      In total, 15 pregnant women who have delivered at the hospital have tested positive for the mosquito-borne virus, Dr. Christine Curry said.      Those women are being monitored by doctors at the hospital.      \\"Zika is a thing. Zika is real, and while we don't understand it fully, that is not a reason to dismiss its impact,\\" Curry said Wednesday at a Miami Beach Commission meeting.      So far, there have been 604 travel-related infections confirmed in the state and 56 locally acquired cases, with the majority being contracted in Miami-Dade County.      Pregnant women who live in or have to traveled to South Florida are urged to wear insect repellent, long clothing and limit their time outdoors.      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged doctors in Florida to test all pregnant women for the virus, and pregnant women can also contact their local county health department for a Zika risk assessment and testing hours and information.      Health officials said they have monitoring pregnant women \\"with evidence of Zika regardless of (their) symptoms.\\"      Copyright 2016 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved. ||||| (CNN) A plane flying over Miami Beach on Friday conducted aerial spraying for mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus, despite concerns over possible effects that the insecticide naled may have on health and the environment.      Since the mosquito that carries Zika is most active at predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times.      So far, there have been 56 local transmissions of the Zika virus in Florida , which has 20.6 million residents. The state has seen 596 travel-related cases of Zika, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).      The virus can cause neurological disorders in unborn children      Health officials have sprayed pesticide and larvicide on the ground in areas where they believe the mosquitoes may be, and are expanding those efforts with the aerial use of naled.      The spraying was originally scheduled for Thursday, but was delayed for a day after concerned residents protested.      Andres Blanco wasn't among those protesting. A valet at South Beach's landmark Clevelander Hotel, Blanco said he wasn't scared.      \\"No way man, I think it's good!\\" The longtime Miami Beach resident said. \\"They've got to do something to kill those mosquitoes.\\"      Naled used since 1950s      Experts say there's no reason to be concerned over the effects of the insecticide on human health and the environment. The amount of insecticide used is minimal -- two tablespoons per acre -- about the size of a football field, according to the CDC.

Peter Beach, who describes himself as a closet anarchist, condemned the spraying.      South Beach resident Peter Beach, 62, said he is really angry about the spraying. Beach, who described himself as a closet anarchist, voiced contempt for the EPA and CDC approval of naled, the main chemical in the insecticide Dibrom.      \\"This is a toxic substance that kills everything,\\" he said. \\"You think these tourists on the beach know they are lying on sand that was hit with a toxic carcinogenic hours earlier? No way.\\"      The US has used naled since the 1950s, and sprays it on about 16 million acres nationwide annually. Health officials use it to prevent mosquitoes after disasters such as hurricanes and floods, according to the CDC.      Naled breaks down swiftly in water and sunlight, and its chemicals don't cause health problems in people or pets if used in small quantities, according to the CDC.      #ZIKA: Protesters gathering for 2nd day at Miami Beach City Hall; upset about planned #Naled aerial spraying. @NBC6 pic.twitter.com/sDivk7mqc7 — Michael Spears NBC6 (@MikeSpearsNBC6) September 8, 2016      Sprayers produce fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight. It kills mosquitoes on contact.      But while US health officials say it's safe, Europe has banned the use of agricultural products containing naled over safety concerns.      New Yorker Tristan Mullings was determined to take his vacation but didn't bargain on the spraying.      Tristan Mullings, 27, was visiting from Brooklyn. He was aware of the Zika outbreak before he came -- \\"I can't let no mosquito ruin my vacation\\" -- but unaware they would be spraying Friday morning. He voiced concern when he learned the chemicals had been linked by some to neurological disorders      \\"Then I think the spraying is worse (than Zika),\\" he said.      Janet McDonald, an English teacher in Mexico who was in Miami vacationing with a friend from Canada, said spraying was worth the risk compared to the risks posed by a mosquito-born disease.      \\"Am I scared?\\" said McDonald, referring to naled. \\"No, I've had Dengue fever, that is scary.\\"      Rita Doto of Toronto (left) and Janet McDonald were in South Beach \\"for a girls weekend\\" and not worried about naled. \\"I don't know too much about (naled) said Doto, \\"I hear it's bad, but so is Zika.\\"      Growing fears      The presence of Zika-carrying mosquitoes in Florida has sparked fears, especially after Gov. Rick Scott announced in July that the first local transmission of the virus in the continental United States occurred north of downtown Miami.      A few days later, in an unprecedented move, the CDC announced a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit that area. Authorities launched aggressive mosquito-control measures, including spraying in the area.      JUST WATCHED Mosquito samples test positive for Zika in Miami Beach Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mosquito samples test positive for Zika in Miami Beach 01:01      Last month, the CDC advised pregnant women not to travel to an area of Miami Beach limited to 1½ square miles.      Pregnant women are at greatest risk because the virus can have devastating consequences for an unborn baby, including the birth defect microcephaly and other neurological disorders, as well as miscarriage and stillbirth among women infected while pregnant.      In addition to human health, critics say naled kills pollinators and wildlife, and is toxic to the environment.      South Carolina beekeeper Juanita Stanley recently lost more than 3 million bees when Summerville officials aerially sprayed a small area of the town for Zika-carrying mosquitoes.      \\"In the summertime, the bees are already out at dawn, when aerial spraying is recommended,\\" said entomologist Jeffrey Harris, who runs the Honey Bee Extension and Research Program for Mississippi State University. \\"So spraying in the morning is the worst thing they can do for bees.\\" ||||| Florida has 744 reported cases of the Zika virus, with 12 new cases involving people who contracted the disease outside of the state, the Florida Department of Health reported Thursday.      There were no new cases of locally transmitted Zika, with 56 previously reported. Health officials have identified two areas in Miami-Dade County, including part of Miami Beach, where they believe local transmission is occurring.      Investigations, including door-to-door surveys and targeted testing, are ongoing in Pinellas and Palm Beach counties and other areas of Miami-Dade County where people have contracted the virus locally. But health officials said the investigations have not identified additional \\"active transmission\\" zones.      Four of the new travel-related cases involved pregnant women, which is a particular concern since Zika can lead to severe birth defects. Florida has identified a total of 84 pregnant women with the virus.      There are another 604 cases of travel-related Zika, excluding the pregnant women, the Department of Health reported. The other new travel-related cases included three in Miami-Dade County, two in Alachua County and one each in Marion, Orange and Palm Beach counties.      News Service of Florida ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Maggie Fox      Small aircraft started predawn spraying of insecticide to kill Zika-carrying mosquitoes in Miami Beach Friday morning.      The spraying had been delayed a day after worried and angry residents complained to city officials and organized a small protest outside City Hall.      Hours after spraying ended, the mayor's office announced that a fresh pool of mosquitoes had tested positive for the virus.      A map shows the mosquito spraying zone in Miami Beach. Miami-Dade County      Officials assured residents the insecticide, called naled, is safe for people in the amounts being sprayed, and the pre-dawn application would minimize effects on beneficial insects such as bees.      \\"The fact that a fourth Zika-positive mosquito pool has been identified in Miami Beach serves as further confirmation that we must continue our proactive and aggressive approach to controlling the mosquito population, including our recent decision to begin aerial spraying in combination with larvicide treatment by truck,\\" Mayor Carlos Gimenez said.      Related: What's Behind the Bogus Zika Rumors      Miami-Dade County's Mosquito Control team flew small planes just off the beach, using winds to disperse the insecticide across the targeted area.      They’ll spray again Sunday and the next two weekends, Gimenez said. “This schedule will minimize disruption to our school children and families,’ he said in a statement.      Related: Should I Worry About Zika?      Miami Beach is fighting a small outbreak of locally spread Zika virus, which is carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Florida’s got 56 confirmed local cases so far, and travelers are diagnosed with infections acquired overseas daily. At least 84 pregnant women in Florida have been diagnosed with Zika.      “When applied according to label instructions, naled can be used for public health mosquito control programs without posing risks to people.\\"      There’s no doubt Zika virus causes brain damage and other birth defects in developing fetuses. The most notable is microcephaly – an abnormally small head caused when the developing brain is destroyed by the virus. Other, less obvious, damage has been seen, also.      And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency and independent academic researchers say naled is safe to use to kill mosquitoes when it’s applied in such small amounts.      Related: Zika Money is Running Out      “When applied according to label instructions, naled can be used for public health mosquito control programs without posing risks to people. People aren’t likely to breathe or touch anything that has enough insecticide on it to harm them,” the CDC says.      But a small and vocal group of protesters say they don’t believe the pesticide is safe and also question the links between Zika and birth defects.      “Given the mounting evidence disproving a direct link between Zika and microcephaly, it’s time to stop the unnecessary aerial spraying of Naled,” a group calling itself “Floridians AGAINST spraying of Naled” says in an online petition that had gathered 7,900 signatures as of Friday.      In fact, the opposite is true. Many studies have now confirmed that Zika virus directly infects developing brain cells, destroying them. The virus has been found in the brains and bodies of fetuses from women infected with Zika, and in the blood and urine of babies born with Zika-related syndromes.      Related: Meet a Woman Who Lost her Baby to Zika      CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden has been pushing to persuade communities the worst hit by Zika virus to use both pesticides such as naled and larvicides, which target the developing mosquitoes.      The approach has helped control an outbreak of Zika in Miami's nearby Wynwood neighborhood, Frieden says.      \\"What we have seen is a very dramatic reduction in populations of the Aedes mosquitos there,\\" Frieden said. ||||| When people in a large area are getting sick or when large numbers of mosquitoes are found, airplanes can be used to treat very large areas with insecticides safely, quickly, and efficiently. This process is called aerial spraying. Below is more information on aerial spraying.      Aerial Spraying and Mosquito Control      Is aerial spraying an effective tool for killing mosquitoes?      Aerial treatment of areas with products that rapidly reduce both adult mosquitoes and their larvae that carry the Zika virus can be effective. Repeated aerial applications of insecticide has reduced mosquito populations as a part of an integrated mosquito management program.      Is aerial spraying alone the best way to control mosquitoes?      Aerial spraying is only one part of the solution for controlling mosquitoes, but it is the one method that can rapidly reduce the number of mosquitoes spreading Zika in a large area. It is the most effective method when large areas must be treated quickly.      Aerial spraying is used as part of an integrated mosquito control program to quickly reduce the number of mosquitoes responsible for infecting people with viruses like Zika, dengue, or chikungunya.      An integrated mosquito control program includes Source reduction. Eliminating mosquito habitats, such as discarded containers and rain gutters. Structural barriers, such as screens and enclosed, air-conditioned spaces, if possible. Larval mosquito control using the appropriate methods for the habitat. Adult mosquito control using insecticides. Community education efforts related to preventing mosquito bites by wearing EPA-registered insect repellents and protective clothing (long-sleeved shirts and long pants).            Aerial Spraying and Insecticides      How is an insecticide chosen for use in aerial spraying?      State and local officials make the decision on what insecticide(s) to use for aerial spraying.      The decision is based on the results of insecticide resistance testing in the target area.      Is aerial spraying experimental?      Aerial spraying is not experimental.      EPA-registered insecticides are used for aerial spraying. EPA-registered insecticides have been studied for their effectiveness and safety when used according to label instructions.      Aerial spraying, using Naled and other insecticides, has been used in many populated areas of the continental United States, including Miami, Tampa, and New Orleans, to help control mosquitoes. In 2014, almost 6 million acres of land in Florida was aerial sprayed with Naled by mosquito control programs.            Where has Naled been used?      Naled has been extensively used since the 1950s and is currently applied by aerial and ground spraying to an average of approximately 16 million acres of the continental United States annually.      It is also used for mosquito control following natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods. (Human Exposure to Mosquito-Control Pesticides ― Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia, 2002 and 2003, CDC, 2005)      In 2004 and 2005, it was used as part of the emergency responses to Hurricanes Charley, Jeanne, Frances, and Katrina.      Naled is currently used in the United States by many local governments and mosquito control districts, including the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, the Lee County Mosquito Control District, and Miami-Dade County.      Historically, Naled has been used in Puerto Rico in attempts to control dengue.      What happens to Naled once it is sprayed?      Naled starts to degrade (break down) immediately on surfaces, in water, and in sunlight.      The chemical dichlorvos (DDVP) can be created when Naled degrades. It also breaks down quickly.      In small quantities DDVP has not been shown to cause health problems in people.      DDVP does not build up in breast milk or breast tissue.      What is Bti and how does it work?      Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti) is a naturally occurring bacteria found in soils.      Bti produces toxins that kill the larvae of mosquitoes and blackflies when swallowed. The toxins cause death by starvation and only begin working when swallowed by certain insects (larvae of mosquitoes, blackflies, and fungus gnats).      There are several strains of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that kill other insect larva like caterpillars and beetles. These are not the same as Bti.      Can Bti only be applied through aerial spraying?      No, Bti is often applied using methods that are not aerial spraying.      Bti can be applied using truck-mounted or backpack spraying. It can also be found as dunks or briquettes that can be put in areas of standing water that cannot be emptied, such as fountains and ornamental ponds, septic tanks, and unchlorinated pools.      Dunks are currently being distributed in Zika prevention kits.      Aerial Spraying and Organic Farming      Is Bti harmful to crops?      Bti is not toxic to people. It has not been shown to make people sick. When used as directed, Bti can be applied safely to standing water where mosquitoes lay eggs without causing harm to food crops or water supplies. Bti is EPA-registered for use in residential, commercial, and agricultural settings. Organic farming operations use Bti.      Aerial Spraying and Human Health      Is aerial spraying of insecticides dangerous/harmful to human health?      No, during aerial spraying, a small amount of insecticide is sprayed over an area, about 1 ounce (two tablespoons) per acre or about the size of a football field.      This small amount does not pose a health risk to people or pets in the area that is sprayed.      When aerial spraying is done correctly, it does not cause asthma attacks.      There is a possibility that spraying of a larvicide, like Bti, can cause eye irritation if a person is outside and looking up when spraying takes place.      EPA-registered products are used for aerial spraying. The label instructions are followed by a licensed professional.      If people prefer to stay inside and close windows and doors when spraying takes place they can, but it is not necessary.      Does aerial spraying cause asthma attacks?      No, when aerial spraying is done correctly, it does not cause asthma attacks.      When applied according to label instructions, EPA-registered insecticides do not pose a risk to human health or the environment.      Research shows that ultra-low volume (ULV) application for mosquito control does not increase the risk of asthma for people living in treatment areas (Karpati et al. 2004, Currier et al. 2005, Duprey et al. 2008).      Will Naled cause cancer?      No, EPA has classified Naled as Group E “Evidence of Non-carcinogenicity for Humans,” meaning that there is no evidence that it causes cancer in people.      During aerial spraying, a small amount of insecticide is sprayed over an area, about 1 ounce (two tablespoons) per acre or about the size of a football field.      Droplets float in the air and kill adult mosquitoes on contact.      Naled starts to degrade (break down) immediately on surfaces, in water, and in sunlight.      EPA conducted risk assessments for Naled and calculated risks under different exposure scenarios.      Because of the very small amount of active ingredient released per acre of ground during aerial spraying, EPA found that for all scenarios and exposures were hundreds or thousands of times below an amount that might pose a health concern.      In an evaluation of thousands of people who conducted agricultural spraying using many types of insecticides, including organophosphates like Naled, no increased risk of any type of cancer was found during the 7-11 years of follow up (Schinasi & Leon, 2008).      However, at high doses, for example if the person doing the spraying is exposed to Naled directly in amounts that are well above those for normal labeled uses, Naled and other organophosphates can overstimulate the nervous system, causing nausea, dizziness, or confusion. This is why it is very important that those who actually work with Naled strictly follow label instructions. Severe high-dose poisoning with any organophosphate can cause convulsions, respiratory paralysis, and death. It is extremely unlikely that any person would come into contact with this amount of Naled when it is applied by a licensed professional according to label instructions.            Will Bti affect human health?      Bti has not been found to pose a health risk to people or pets.      There is a possibility that spraying larvicides, like Bti, can cause eye irritation if a person is outside when spraying takes place.      Bti is an EPA-registered insecticide. EPA-registered insecticides have been studied for their effectiveness and safety when used according to label instructions.      Existing residential and area-wide uses, like aerial or truck spraying, have been evaluated and found to be safe. Using Bti to kill mosquito larvae may reduce the risk of getting infected with Zika virus.      If people prefer to stay inside when spraying takes place they can, but it is not necessary.      Aerial Spraying and Animals      Will aerial spraying hurt pets and other animals?      No, when aerial spraying is done correctly, it does not harm animals.      During aerial spraying, a small amount of insecticide is sprayed over an area, about 1 ounce (two tablespoons) per acre, or about the size of a football field.      This small amount does not pose a health risk to people or pets in the area that is sprayed.      EPA-registered products are used for aerial spraying. The label instructions are followed by a licensed professional. If people prefer to bring pets inside when spraying takes place they can, but it is not necessary.      Aerial spraying will not harm fish or animals that live in the water. People do not need to cover fishponds when spraying takes place. If a larvicide is sprayed, it is better if ponds are not covered.      Will aerial spraying kill bees?      Aerial spraying can be done in ways that minimize risk to bees.      Spraying Naled can kill bees outside of their hives at the time of spraying; therefore, spraying is limited to dawn or dusk when bees are inside their hives.      Because Naled breaks down quickly, it does not pose a risk to the honey bee populations. Studies show that honey production between hives in treated and untreated sites did not show significantly different quantities of honey over the course of a season. For additional protection, urban bee keepers inside the spray zone can cover their hives when spraying occurs.      Although significant exposure to bees would not occur with Naled application at dawn and dusk, beekeepers can reduce potential exposure to bee colonies even more by covering colonies and preventing bees from exiting during designated treatment periods or, if possible, relocating colonies to an untreated site.      The spraying of mosquito larvicides will not impact bees.      Will aerial spraying kill birds or other animals?      No, when aerial spraying is done correctly, it does not harm birds or other animals.      The insecticides used for aerial spraying do not pose risks to wildlife or the environment.      Aerial spraying does not cause long-term harm to the environment or local ecosystem, even if spraying happens more than once.      EPA-registered insecticides used for aerial spraying break down rapidly in the environment, and it displays low toxicity to birds and mammals.      Aerial spraying will not harm coquis or fish or animals that live in the water. People do not need to cover fish ponds when spraying takes place. If a larvicide is sprayed, it is better if ponds are not covered.      Will Bti affect animals or wildlife?      No, Bti does not pose a risk to other mammals, birds, or aquatic life, including coqui frogs in Puerto Rico and USVI. The toxins it produces only begin working once swallowed by certain insects (larvae of mosquitoes, blackflies, and fungus gnats).      Aerial Spraying and the Environment      Will aerial spraying pollute water?      No, when aerial spraying is done correctly, it does not pollute water.      Research shows that, when applied according to label instructions, EPA-registered insecticides sprayed in low levels (about two tablespoons per acre [4,046 square meters]) does not cause long-term harm to the environment or local ecosystem, even if spraying happens more than once.      Will chemicals from aerial spraying contaminate soil?      No, when chemicals used in aerial spraying are used correctly, they will not contaminate soil.      Aerial spraying does not cause harm to the environment or local ecosystem, even if spraying happens more than once.      When applied according to label instructions, EPA-registered insecticides do not pose a risk to human health or the environment.      More information can be found on the US Environmental Protection Agency’s website.      Is Bti harmful to crops or water supplies?      Bti is not toxic to people. It has not been shown to make people sick. When used as directed, Bti can be applied safely to standing water where mosquitoes lay eggs without causing harm to food crops or water supplies. Bti is EPA-registered for use in residential, commercial, and agricultural settings. Organic farming operations use Bti.      Multiple Bti products are available for use. Some can be used by pest control professionals in certain drinking water storage containers (e.g., cisterns) while others are not EPA-registered for that use. Always follow label instructions. It is important to follow the label for any Bti product to ensure that the product is being used correctly. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Florida health officials have confirmed that 84 pregnant women have tested positive for the Zika virus in the state.

When creating or purchasing a hurricane emergency kit, ensure it covers essential items like non-perishable food, water, medication, first-aid supplies, flashlights, batteries, and other necessary items specified by NHC's supply list. It's crucial to consider your family's specific needs, such as including items for pets, infants, elderly, and any family members with special medical needs. In conclusion, the National Hurricane Center's main priority is to ensure people are well-equipped and informed to face hurricane situations. While they do not explicitly comment on the effectiveness of specific kits from Amazon or other manufacturers, it is essential to ensure that the emergency kit meets NHC's recommended guidelines and covers your family's specific needs to be considered effective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Weeding by hand can be tough on the fingernails and skin of your fingers. To avoid hurting your hands, and to give yourself a stable grip on the weeds, use cotton gardening gloves. You can purchase cotton gardening gloves at any nursery or gardening center.  Hand weeding is an effective, though time-consuming and tedious, method of controlling weeds. This method is preferable in small lawns, or in lawns not completely overrun with weeds. If weeds in your lawn are widespread, another removal method will be more practical. The blade of the trowel or digger should be at about a 65° angle—not quite vertical, but largely upright. Drive the tool into the soil about 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) to loosen the soil surrounding the weed’s roots. Repeat this 3 or 4 times, loosening the soil on all sides of the root. Trowels and dandelion diggers can both be purchased at a local plant nursery or gardening center. Both should cost less than 5 USD. To properly remove a weed, you need to pull it out by the root. Hold the base of the weed firmly, using your full hand—don’t just pinch the stalk of a weed using 2 fingers. If you’re pulling up a clump of weeds, grasp the entire clump at its base. Perennial weeds like dandelions can be plucked most effectively in early spring. If left to grow until summer, the dandelions will have put down thick taproots. Loosen the root in the soil if you feel resistance when you attempt to uproot it. Twist the base of the root back and forth 5 or 6 times. This will loosen the weed’s roots in the soil and make it easier to pull.  If you pull too hard without rotating the weed, its stem will snap off but the root will remain in the ground. The weeds can quickly regrow from a root still in the ground. If there is a small hole left behind after you’ve pulled the weed, fill it with some loose soil. Carry a small trash bag around with you as you move across your lawn pulling weeds. As soon as you’ve plucked weeds—whether individual or in large clumps—from the ground, toss them into the bag. This will prevent the weeds’ seeds from scattering over your lawn. Summary:","output":"Using cotton gardening gloves, hand weeding is an effective method for controlling weeds in small lawns or those not overrun with weeds. Drive a trowel or digger into the soil at a 65° angle, about 4-5 inches deep, to loosen the soil around the weed's roots. Repeat this process 3-4 times. To remove a weed, hold the base of the weed firmly and pull it out by the root. Loosen and twist the root if resistance is felt. Fill any small holes left by pulled weeds with loose soil and dispose of pulled weeds in a trash bag to prevent seed scattering."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer:","output":"Yes, I can answer your complex question. The title \\"Purple Rain-Union\\" from the sixth episode of the fourth season of the animated comedy series \\"Bob's Burgers\\" is indeed a reference to the song, film, and the sixth studio album by the iconic American recording artist Prince. The album, also titled \\"Purple Rain,\\" is closely related to the 1984 film of the same name, and it marks the first time that Prince's band, The Revolution, was featured alongside him. \\"Purple Rain\\" was a groundbreaking album that showcased Prince's immense talent as a singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. It was a blend of various music styles, including rock, pop, R&B, and new wave, and it played a significant role in establishing Prince as a major force in the music industry during the 1980s. The album included several hit singles such as \\"When Doves Cry,\\" \\"Let's Go Crazy,\\" and, of course, the titular track \\"Purple Rain.\\" In the film \\"Purple Rain,\\" Prince played the lead character, known as \\"The Kid,\\" who was a struggling musician trying to make it big in the Minneapolis music scene.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute at the age of five? from the following article ?  Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother.  In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.  A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\".  At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922. In July 1922 she performed a Bach Prelude and Fugue on the piano, for which Joseph praised her warmly, writing: \\"I think everyone enjoyed the Bach from beginning to end, they all made nice contented noises at the... The answer is:","output":"To find the answer to the given question, I will first identify the relevant information within the text.

The text mentions: \\"In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years.\\" Thus, I can determine that the person of interest is a female. I will now search for any last names mentioned in the text to see if they can be associated with this person. Checking the text again, I find the following references to last names:  1. \\"Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.\\" 2. \\"In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.\\" From these sentences, I can infer that the person mentioned earlier is Imogen, as she is the only female mentioned with a connection to both Gustav Holst and the Froebel Institute at age five. Since the question asks for the last name, and Gustav Holst is her father, I can conclude that the answer to the question is: The answer is: Holst."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Five city and state officials were charged Wednesday with involuntary manslaughter over the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the Detroit Free Press reports. They are Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon—the highest-ranking official to be charged in the water crisis so far, per the Detroit News—former Flint Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, former City of Flint Water Department Manager Howard Croft, plus Michigan Department of Environmental Quality’s Drinking Water Chief Liane Shekter-Smith and Water Supervisor Stephen Busch. Twelve people died after the city's water supply was changed to the Flint River in April 2014 and there was an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. Prosecutors allege that Lyon knew about the outbreak by at least Jan. 28, 2015, yet did not make the news public until a year later; he is charged with causing the Dec. 13, 2015, death of Robert Skidmore. All of the involuntary manslaughter charges are linked to Skidmore's death; the 85-year-old died after many cases of Legionnaires' disease had been diagnosed, but the public still had not been notified of the outbreak. Lyon is also charged with misconduct in office for allegedly telling an official to halt an analysis that would have helped figure out what caused the outbreak, the Detroit Free Press reports. Also Wednesday, Chief Medical Executive Dr. Eden Wells was charged with obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer; she is accused of giving false testimony to a special agent, lying to a peace officer about when she knew of the outbreak, and threatening to withhold funding for the Flint Area Community Health and Environment Partnership if it did not stop investigating the outbreak. Flint residents are still advised to use a filter if they plan to drink the city's tap water, and many use bottled water instead, which is distributed for free in the city.","output":"Once upon a time, in a city called Flint, in the state of Michigan, there was a serious problem with the water.

One of them, named Nick Lyon, knew about the dangerous water but didn't tell everyone right away. He's also accused of stopping someone from figuring out why the water was bad. Another person in charge, Dr. Eden Wells, is also in trouble for not telling the truth about when she found out about the bad water and for trying to stop people from learning more about it.

The Critics Group was under the direction of an English folk singer who passed away in what year ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Critics Group was under the direction of English folk singer Ewan MacColl, who passed away in 1989."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  A tsunami is an unusual form of wave caused by an infrequent powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption or a collapse of land into the sea. These events can temporarily lift or lower the surface of the sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave, a tsunami, radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water and which therefore travels much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. In the deep open sea, tsunamis have wavelengths of around 80 to 300 miles (130 to 480 km), travel at speeds of over 600 miles per hour (970 km/hr) and usually have a height of less than three feet, so they often pass unnoticed at this stage. In contrast, ocean surface waves caused by winds have wavelengths of a few hundred feet, travel at up to 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) and are up to 45 feet (14 metres) high.A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually, but is spread out over the wave front, so as the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will, on average, be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions, and this affects the direction of the wave front - an effect known as refraction - which can focus the strength of the advancing tsunami on some areas and weaken it in others according to undersea topography. As a tsunami moves into shallower water its speed decreases, its wavelength shortens and its amplitude increases enormously, behaving in the same way as a wind-generated wave in shallow water, but on a vastly greater scale.  Either the trough or the crest of a tsunami can arrive at the coast first....  answer the following question:  What is the name when a tsunami does not usually break but rushes inland, flooding all in its path?

Whether or not the ship crashes or lands on Earth is unknown.In Antarctica, the winter months of 1982, a helicopter flies hurriedly after a husky. The man riding next to the pilot shoots a rifle and drops grenades hoping to kill the dog. The runs toward an American research base, Outpost 31, where a 12-man research crew is getting ready for the upcoming winter. The helicopter, which they see is from a Norwegian research base, flies in and lands. The Americans watch puzzled as two men that emerge from the helicopter speak frantically in their native language. One of them pulls the pin on a grenade but clumsily throws it behind him. As he frantically tries to find it in the snow, it explodes, killing him and taking the helicopter with it. The pilot (named Matias in the prequel) is shooting his rifle hysterically and talking frantically; no one can understand what he is saying and the man shoots Bennings (Peter Maloney) in his left leg. The camp leader Garry (Donald Moffat) shoots and kills the gibbering man in defense.Puzzled about why the Norwegians were trying to kill the dog, MacReady (Kurt Russell) the team's helicopter pilot, their doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart) and Norris (Charles Hallahan), go to investigate the Norwegian base. Everyone is dead; one of them had barricaded himself in the radio room and is still sitting frozen in his chair, his wrists and throat slit in an apparent suicide. Mac and Copper explore further, finding a large and empty block of ice. Outside in the snow, along with one or two burned human bodies, Mac and Copper find the burnt and frozen corpse of a twisted creature, not man but not beast, either. They bring it back to their own base for an autopsy, but that muddies up the mystery.That night, the new stray husky is locked in with the sled dogs.

Manny studied animal communication, while Dean studied animal feeding patterns and nutrition.  Which student learned more about animals working together to find food?  Hint: Communication is any way that animals share information. Many animals live in social groups. For these animals, being able to communicate is essential. Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict. Communication may help animals work together to find food and defend themselves from predators. It also helps them find mates and care for their offspring. In addition, communication helps adult animals teach the next generation learned behaviors. Therefore, communication generally improves the chances of animals surviving and reproducing. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, it is likely that Manny, who studied animal communication, learned more about animals working together to find food. The hint emphasizes the importance of communication as a way for animals to share information, specifically among animals that live in social groups. Effective communication enables these animals to cooperate and avoid conflict with one another, which in turn enhances their overall chances for survival and reproduction. Studying animal communication would give Manny insight into various ways animals work together to find food, as many animals use different forms of communication such as vocalizations, body language, and chemical signals to achieve this goal. These communications can help them coordinate their efforts when locating food sources, share knowledge about the location of new food sources, and alert each other to potential dangers. On the other hand, Dean's study of animal feeding patterns and nutrition focuses more on the actual process of consuming food, the nutritional value of their diet, and the specific dietary requirements of various animal species. While this study is important in understanding how animals meet their nutritional needs and how it affects their growth, development, and overall health, it does not concentrate on the aspect of animals working together in their quest for food. In summary, although both Manny and Dean acquired valuable knowledge about animals in their respective areas of study, it can be concluded that Manny, who studied animal communication, learned more about animals working together to find food. This is due to the fact that communication plays a critical role in the cooperation and coordination among animals that live in social groups, facilitating efficient ways of searching for, sharing, and consuming food resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mojo is a fictional character, a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually those featuring the X-Men family of characters. Created by writer Ann Nocenti and artist Arthur Adams, Mojo first appeared in Longshot #4 (December 1985), as the titular hero's archenemy, and subsequently a villain to the X-Men and their various sub-groups as well. Mojo is one of the \\"Spineless Ones,\\" an alien race that is immobile without advanced technology. At the time she wrote the Longshot miniseries, writer Ann Nocenti was pursuing her Master's degree at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, working at the magazine Lies of Our Times, and reading the work of writers like Marshall McLuhan, Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman and Walter Lippmann. Mojo, a slaver and dictator who rules his dimension through the television programs he produces, was created as a direct result of these influences. (A character named Manufactured Consent after the Chomsky book of the same name, who appeared in Nocenti's 1990 book The New Mutants Summer Special, was also born of these works.) Artist Art Adams designed the character per Nocenti's instructions that he be disgusting and unpleasant, and also tried to make him look frightening. The wires that hold Mojo's eyelids open, thus preventing him from blinking, were inspired by an interview with actor Malcolm McDowell on Late Night with David Letterman, in which McDowell revealed that the similar apparatus he had to wear for the Ludovico technique scene in A Clockwork Orange had scarred his corneas. The rest of the equipment attached to Mojo's head controls his mechanized chair.  Mojo first appeared in Longshot #4 (December 1985), and was the main villain of the miniseries, appearing in the subsequent three issues.  The character subsequently appeared in The New Mutants Annual #2 (1986). That same year, in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #10, Mojo appeared as the villain in the story, which saw Longshot join the X-Men. In 1988, Mojo appeared in a backup story in The Uncanny X-Men Annual #12. He was the main villain of the one-shot special Excalibur: Mojo Mayhem (December 1989). Subsequent appearances include Marvel Comics Presents #89 (1991), The Uncanny X-Men Annual #15 (1991), Wolverine #52 (March 1992), X-Men #6 (March 1992), Wolverine #53 (April 1992), X-Men #7 (April 1992), #10-11 (July-August 1992), The Uncanny X-Men Annual 16 (Annual 1992), Marvel Comics Presents #119 (1993), What If? #59 (March 1994), X-Men Adventures: Season Two #11 (December 1994), Marvel: Portraits of the Universe #1 (March 1995), X-Men: Mutations #1 (1996), Youngblood/X-Force #1 (July 1996), X-Force/Youngblood #1 (August 1996), X-Force #60-61 (November-December 1996), The Adventures of the X-Men #9-10 (1996-January 1997), X-Babies: Murderama #1 (January 1998), X-Force #76 (April 1998), X-Babies Reborn #1 (January 2000), X-Men Unlimited #32 (September 2001), Exiles #18-19 (December 2002-January 2003), The Uncanny X-Men #460-461 (August 2005), and Exiles #73-74 (February 2006).

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

Hint: Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. One way this can happen is modeled in the Figure below . Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again.

Mercedes-Benz unveils rugged 2013 G-Class SUV Mercedes-Benz has again reshaped its G-Class, the closest vehicle left to the giant, gas-guzzling, Hummeresque SUVs of the 1990s. Thinking of invading a third-world country? You'll want to show up in a G-Class to take the reins of power. But hold off the tanks until August, when it comes to showrooms. Perhaps the biggest change is under the hood: the 2013 G63 AMG will come with an eight-cylinder bi-turbo engine. For fuel economy, as if that matters, there will be a stop-start feature to turn off the engine at stoplights. For the redo, Mercedes has loaded up its premier luxury off-road vehicle with lots of technology. The instrument cluster and center console have been completely redesigned and Mercedes' new, fancy infotainment system has been added. Now, safety features like blind-spot detection, a parking aid and adaptive cruise control have been added. When it began in 1979, the G-Class had a sparse interior to go with its rugged, off-roading spirit. It has since been gentrified: \\"Our G-Class has been a force to be reckoned with for the last 33 years. In its latest evolutionary stage, it offers state-of-the­-art, powerful engines, a further improved range of luxurious appointments and the very latest safety features, as well, of course, as its now legendary off-road capabilities. At the same time the design remains true to its down-to-earth, unmistakable style,\\" says Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Mercedes parent Daimler, in a statement. Outside, improvements include LED daytime running lights and new mirrors. The AMG version also features a new, characteristic AMG radiator grille with double louvers, plus distinctive new bumpers with large air intakes. Red brake calipers and 20-inch wheels are available for the first time. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Mercedes-Benz, a car company, showing off a new car they made in 2013 called the G-Class SUV.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The Lives of Others Movie plot: The Lives of Others is at once a political thriller and a human drama. The film opens in East Berlin in 1984 with a sequence that alternates scenes from an interrogation with scenes from a training class for aspiring officers of the Stasi, or secret police. Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), code name HGW XX/7, is demonstrating his interrogation technique using audio of his own interrogation of a suspect. Wiesler instructs the students on how to tell whether a subject is lying. A student asks a question that Wiesler judges to be a bit too compassionate (read \\"bourgeois\\"), and the professor marks the student's name on the attendance record: surely this student has just flunked the course, or worse. During the feature's first thirty minutes, writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck draws a portrait of Wiesler that borders on caricature: Wiesler is a highly skilled officer of the Stasi, a proud, zealous, disciplined and entirely cold-blooded professional. He is one of the many cogs in the wheel of \\"the System,\\" working anonymously and tirelessly, convinced that his efforts are building a better Socialist society.At the end of the class, Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), Wiesler's old school friend (and probably his only friend), who has risen to the position of head of the Culture Department at Stasi, comes to invite Wiesler to a theatrical premiere. The play is by the celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and its leading character is played by Dreyman's lover, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), an actress of great reputation. Dreyman, who writes plays about the heroic proletariat, lives a rather comfortable life in a plush East Berlin apartment, enjoying a certain notoriety among DDR officials who value him because he's one of the few East German writers whose work is read in the west. He preserves the respect of the artistic community by using his (relatively) secure position for occasional interventions in favor of dissident fellow artists....

Article: One of the most popular American singers of the twentieth century was Elvis Presley. He made the Rock & Roll music popular around the world. He sold millions of records and made many successful films, and he helped change the direction of popular music in the 1960s. Elvis Presley was born in a poor family in 1935. His parents were simple country people who often took him to church, where he learned to sing and he never forgot the kind of songs that he used to sing in church as a child. When he was a teenager, Elvis moved from Tupelos to Memphis in Tennessee, where he attended high school, but he was not a good student. His only real interest was singing. He began to sing in the style that is called \\"country and western\\". In 1955 he recorded some songs for his mother's birthday. The people at the recording studio liked his singing and his music. There was something different about it. It was country and western music, but it also sounded a little like the music, which black people used to sing in the American South, music known as \\"blues\\". Shortly after that, Elvis met Tom Parker, who became his manager and arranged concerts for him across the United States and new recordings as well. Soon Elvis rose to fame all over the country. Later, Elvis went to Hollywood and began to appear in films like Love Me Tender and King Creole. But Elvis found it hard to live with success, like many other entertainment personalities   .He began to take drugs and his health began to suffer. When he died at an early age of 42 in 1977, his many millions of fans were shocked. \\"The King Is Dead!\\" the newspaper said. But today his memory and his music live on and he will always be remembered as the King of Rock & Roll. Question: Judging from the passage, we may conclude  _   . Answer: The answer is:","output":"Judging from the passage, we may conclude that Elvis Presley was an incredibly influential and popular American singer who played a significant role in popularizing Rock & Roll music worldwide. Despite coming from a poor family and not excelling academically, his passion for singing and his unique blending of country and western music with blues led him to a successful career in both music and films. Unfortunately, he struggled with the pressures of success, which contributed to his decline in health and early death at the age of 42.

The statement above highlights the importance of integrating a well-rounded Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach into an organization's overall business strategy. By doing so, companies can foster trust and consumer confidence while simultaneously enhancing their positive impact on society as a whole. A comprehensive CSR plan usually involves several key components, which are detailed below: 1. Ethical Business Practices: Companies are expected to operate with a high level of integrity and adhere to all laws and regulations that govern their industries. This involves ensuring fair labor practices, honoring contractual obligations, and refraining from engaging in corrupt or deceptive activities. 2. Environmental Sustainability: Companies can contribute to the well-being of the planet by minimizing their carbon footprint, conserving natural resources, and implementing eco-friendly solutions within their daily operations. This could encompass responsible waste management, utilizing green energy sources, and engaging in sustainable supply chain practices. 3. Social Impact: Companies should commit to making a positive impact on the communities in which they operate by doing things such as supporting local initiatives, promoting charitable giving, and collaborating with non-profit organizations to provide social and educational programs for underprivileged populations. 4. Employee Well-being and Development: Prioritizing employee welfare is critical for companies that wish to be socially responsible. This might include providing fair wages and benefits, ensuring a safe and inclusive work environment, and offering professional development opportunities that enable employees to enhance their skills and grow within the organization. 5. Transparent Communications: Maintaining open and honest communication with stakeholders is essential for fostering trust and accountability. Companies can demonstrate their commitment to responsible conduct by regularly providing updates on their CSR initiatives, discussing the impact of their efforts, and addressing any concerns that arise. 6. Stakeholder Engagement: Proactively engaging with stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, and investors, provides valuable insights that can help a company refine its CSR approach. By actively listening to the needs and expectations of its various stakeholders, a business can better align its social responsibility strategy with the broader goals of the community. By integrating these elements into their CSR strategy, companies can enjoy a wide range of benefits. They can enhance their brand reputation, attract and retain top talent, appeal to socially conscious investors, and create long-lasting relationships with customers who value ethics and sustainability.

Each individual   ant hardly weigh anything, but put together they weigh roughly the same as all of mankind. They also live nearly everywhere, except on frozen mountain tops and around the poles.Foranimals their size, ants have been astonishingly successful, largely due to their wonderfulsocial behavior. In colonies   that range in size from a few hundred to tens of millions, they organize their lives with a clear division of labor. Even more amazing is how they achievethis level of organization. Where we use sound and sight to communicate, ants dependprimarily on pheromone  , chemicals sent out by individuals and smelled or tastedby fellow members of their colony. When an ant finds food, it produces a pheromone that will lead others straight to where the food is. When an individual ant comes under attack or is dying, it sends out an alarm pheromone to warn the colony to prepare for a conflict as a defense unit. In fact, when it comes to the art of war, ants have no equal. They are completely fearless and will readily take on a creature much larger than themselves, attacking in large groups and overcoming their target. Such is their devotion to the common good of the colony that not only soldier ants but also worker ants will sacrifice their lives to help defeat an enemy. Behaving in this selfless and devoted manner, these little creatures have survived on Earth, for more than 140 million years, far longer than dinosaurs.

The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance.

The only variation in the two sentences is the slight difference in their structures and a minor difference in punctuation usage; however, the meaning that they convey remains the same.

FILE - This Oct. 17, 2011 file photo, cars move through the drive-thru window at a McDonald's in Springfield, Ill. McDonald's Corp. on Tuesday, July 29, 2014 said it has been notified by the National... (Associated Press)      The National Labor Relations Board said Tuesday that the world's biggest hamburger chain could be named as a joint employer in several complaints regarding worker rights at franchise-owned restaurants. The decision is pivotal because it could expose McDonald's Corp. to liability for management practices in those locations.      It also comes as protests for higher pay have captured national attention, with labor groups calling for pay of 15 an hour and the right to unionize. Organizers had been pushing to get McDonald's named as a joint employer at franchised restaurants, a move intended to give them a centralized and powerful target.      In the U.S., the vast majority of McDonald's more than 14,000 restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees. The same is true for many other fast-food chains, including Burger King and Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza hut. As such, the companies have sought to distance themselves from the pay protests by saying they don't determine wages at its franchised locations.      Heather Smedstad, senior vice president of human resources for McDonald's USA, said in a phone interview that the company has never been determined to be a joint employer in the past and that it would fight the decision by the labor board.      \\"This is such a radical departure that it should be a concern to business men and women across the country,\\" she said.      Still, labor organizers say McDonald's should be held accountable because it has so much control in setting the terms for how its restaurants are run, including what menus, supplies, uniforms and training materials are used.      \\"There's really no doubt who's in charge,\\" said Micah Wissinger, an attorney who brought a case on behalf of McDonald's workers in New York City.      In March, lawsuits on behalf of McDonald's workers in three states also detailed use of company software that monitors the ratio of labor costs as a percentage of sales at its restaurants. When that ratio climbs above a target, workers were forced to wait around before they could clock in, according to one of the suits.      McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, has said it would investigate the claims.      In a call arranged by labor organizers, longtime McDonald's worker Richard Eiker also recounted how McDonald's regularly sends representatives to check up on how franchisees are running restaurants, including by standing outside the drive-thru to time how quickly cars go through.      \\"Managers go crazy when corporate comes in for these inspections,\\" he said, adding that restaurants are constantly told to keep costs down.      The National Labor Relations Board said 181 cases involving McDonald's have been filed since 2012. For the 43 cases that were found to have merit, the board said McDonald's or its franchisees will be named as respondents if the parties fail to reach a settlement.      The other cases were found to have no merit or are still pending.      The International Franchise Association, which represents franchisees, has opposed the identification of McDonald's as a joint employer. The group also recently filed a lawsuit in Seattle challenging whether fast-food franchisees should be treated like large employers, thus subjecting them to a new 15 minimum wage at an earlier date than smaller businesses.      \\"If franchisors are joint employers with their franchisees, these thousands of small business owners would lose control of the operations and equity they worked so hard to build,\\" the International Franchise Association said in a statement.      ____      Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi ||||| McDonald's shares responsibility for working conditions with its franchisees who operate roughly 90 percent of its restaurants, according to the National Labor Relations Board.      The decision, discussed Tuesday with McDonald’s and parties, is significant because McDonald’s has long maintained that its franchisees are independent owner-operators who set their own policies, including wages.      The Oak Brook-based hamburger chain quickly came out against the decision.      \\"This relationship does not establish a joint employer relationship under the law,” Heather Smedstad, senior vice president of human resources at McDonald’s USA, said in a statement regarding the corporation’s relationship with its franchisees. “This decision to allow unfair labor practice complaints to allege that McDonald’s is a joint employer with its franchisees is wrong. McDonald’s will contest this allegation in the appropriate forum.”            Trade groups that represent restaurants, retailers and franchisees also blasted the NLRB’s determination.      “The staff decision issued today by the National Labor Relations Board recommending that McDonald’s and its franchisees should be considered joint employers gives a whole new meaning to the word 'outrageous,'” National Retail Federation Senior Vice President for Government Relations David French said in a statement from the trade group.            McDonald’s and other fast food operators have been pressured by union groups in recent months to raise wages and improve working conditions. McDonald’s and other restaurant operators have said that franchisees are independent business owners who set their own policies.      Some worker activists said the decision was proof that McDonald’s has more control over its franchisees more than it said it does.      “The reality is that McDonald’s requires franchisees to adhere to such regimented rules and regulations that there’s no doubt who’s really in charge,” Micah Wissinger, an attorney at Levy Ratner who brought the case on behalf of McDonald’s workers in New York City, said in a statement provided by a public relations firm representing workers who are seeking a 15 hourly wage and union representation.      “The general counsel has weighed in, essentially telling the different regions of the NLRB to now include McDonald’s as an employer,” Wissinger said.      jwohl@tribune.com      Follow @JessicaWohl Follow @chibreakingbiz      Tribune reporter Alejandra Cancino contributed. ||||| Summary:","output":"McDonald's is facing pressure over the labor practices at its US restaurants.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose relationship with their wife becomes strained? , can you please find it?   John, an ambitious young police officer, is sent undercover to join a violent football firm associated with the fictitious club Shadwell Town to track down the 'generals' - the shadowy figures who orchestrate the violence. His team of four gradually ingratiate themselves into the lives of The Dogs, the nickname that Shadwell's fans give themselves.  The main site for this is The Rock, a public house around which The Dogs' lives revolve.  Gradually, the hard drinking and hard fighting macho culture - where Saturday's match and Saturday's fight are all that matters - prove strangely irresistible to John and he slowly finds himself becoming one of the thugs he has been sent to entrap. His relationships with his wife, his superiors and even his team become strained. Eventually his wife returns to her parents' house and rebuffs his attempted reconciliation. The police operation is abruptly wound up for budgeting reasons, just as it seems John is making progress in identifying those who pull the strings. The closing sequence shows a shaven-headed John taking part in a racist march, having become nothing more than a neo-nazi fascist.  One of his team approaches him to try to help him, but is rebuffed. John says that he is, again, working undercover.  There is a degree of ambiguity, and it might be that he is working undercover, though it may also be that he has become deluded and has merely mired himself in an even less pleasant world.  His fascist chanting at the very end makes it clear that whatever the truth, John is unable to prevent himself from sinking into his character.

As I write this review in 2008, we are mired in a remake culture. Movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including 'King Kong, 'The Wicker Man' and practically every film that ever starred Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as 'Dough for the Do-Do' proves. An entirely pointless colorized version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece 'Porky in Wackyland', 'Dough for the Do-Do' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over Clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by Friz Freleng. Freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with Clampett's source material, although in truth no director could hope to come close to Clampett's inspired insanity.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Jill Reilly. PUBLISHED:. 12:12 EST, 15 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 03:38 EST, 17 January 2013. Cuban authorities are scrambling to contain a cholera outbreak that has infected dozens of people in Havana, the capital city of 2.2 million residents and a popular tourism destination. The Health Ministry said the outbreak was first detected on January 6 and was being contained. 'Fifty-one cases have been confirmed to date,' the statement read, without mentioning fatalities. Outbreak: Cuban authorities are scrambling to contain a cholera outbreak that has sickened dozens of people in Havana, the capital city of 2.2 million residents and a popular tourism destination. Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, from less than one day to five days, and produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients. But recent outbreaks in nearby Haiti have killed more than 7,200 people. 'Due to the measures adopted transmission is in the phase of extinction,' it said. But in off-the-record discussions with a ministry official and doctor directly involved in fighting the outbreak, a different picture emerged with hundreds of suspected cases. They said the first cases were traced to a baseball game at the Latin American Stadium in the Cerro municipality of the Cuban capital, where fans come from all parts of the city to watch their team, the Industriales, play. 'We know what happened. Either the pork sandwiches or Tan Rico soda pop was contaminated at a game earlier this month,' the official said. 'Even some of the baseball players became sick,' she added. The Health Ministry statement said the outbreak had begun in Cerro and 'later spread to other municipalities in the capital.' Tens of thousands of British tourists Cuba every year and in particular visiting Havana, but there have been no reports of foreigners catching the illness. Concern: Tens of thousands of British tourists travel to Cuba every year and in particular visit Havana, but there have been no reports of foreigners catching the illness. Several European diplomats have told AP they are considering issuing travel advisories to citizens planning visits to Cuba, and have been concerned that the government is not sharing information with them in a timely manner. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Tourism is the top sector in Cuba's flagging Communist economy, with 2.8 million visitors a year, making £1.5billion. In 2010, 174,343 tourists from Britain visited the country. A major cholera outbreak is sure to make some visitors think twice about a trip, despite Cuba's sterling reputation in responding to epidemics and natural disasters. Community clinics and family doctors are on high alert and giving out instructions to prevent the disease, transportation hubs have passengers sterilizing their shoes before leaving town and eateries are being systematically inspected and sometimes closed, residents say. The official said Havana had been preparing to fight the disease since Cuba's first cholera outbreak in decades last year in eastern Granma province. Killer disease: Recent outbreaks in nearby Haiti have killed more than 7,200 people. There have been scattered cases since then, but all were traced to the Granma area and quickly contained, she said. 'This time is different. There are many cases, but we are well prepared in terms of supplies and the protocol,' she said, adding, 'let's just hope we can stop this before it becomes much worse.' The lack of official information until Tuesday has led to rumors that dozens have died in the Cuban capital, though the official and doctor said there had been only one fatality. The family of one man, 46-year-old Ubaldo Pino Rodriguez, told The Associated Press last week that he died of cholera in Cerro on Jan. 2, about two weeks after going to the hospital with severe vomiting. Rodriguez's sister, Yanise Pino, said her brother had a drinking problem and lived in squalid and unhygienic conditions in a tiny makeshift wooden dwelling. 'When he began to feel bad he thought it was from drinking and nothing else,' she said, adding that he left the hospital of his own accord last month. She said that following his death authorities sealed off Ubaldo's room and told her to burn all his belongings. Three Havana hospitals have been designated to handle cholera cases - one for adults, another for children and a third for pregnant women. Another doctor working at the designated adult hospital, the Center for Tropical Medicine, said they were swamped at the weekend with suspected cases. Cholera is generally not fatal, but can kill in just a few hours when diarrhea and vomiting cause dehydration, especially among the elderly. The illness runs its course within a week, making it relatively easy to track, but at the same time is highly contagious, spreading from hand to mouth, through contaminated food and the water supply. 'So far there is no indication its in the water supply, but we are dumping more chlorine in the system,' the Health Ministry official said. Until 2012, there had been no cholera outbreaks reported in Cuba since well before the 1959 revolution and the creation of a national health system by the Communist government. Hundreds of Cuban doctors and nurses have worked for over a decade in Haiti which has battled a cholera outbreak that has killed more than 7,000 people since that country's 2010 earthquake. Cuba lies closer to Haiti than any other Caribbean country, with the exception of the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the crisis stricken country and has reported more than 20,000 cholera cases and 350 deaths since the Haiti epidemic began. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article is about a cholera outbreak in Havana, Cuba in January 2013. Cholera is a sickness caused by a bacteria called Vibrio cholerae. It can make people feel very bad with watery diarrhea and vomiting, and if they don't get help quickly, they can become very weak or even die. In this case, 51 people got sick in Havana, and authorities were trying to stop the sickness from spreading even more. They think the sickness might have started at a baseball game where people ate bad food or drank bad soda. The authorities were doing their best to handle the situation and prevent more people from getting sick."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Based on the premise \\"weapon systems over the next 5 years requires an approach that keeps cost, schedule, and performance risks to a minimum.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Schedule, cost and performance risks are important factors to consider in the approach taken to weapons systems in the next half-decade.\\" is true?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Schedule, cost, and performance risks are important factors to consider in the approach taken to weapons systems in the next half-decade\\" is true based on the given premise. The premise implies that the development of weapon systems over the next five years must focus on minimizing cost, schedule, and performance risks, which indicates the significance of these factors in the decision-making process. To further substantiate this hypothesis, let us delve into a detailed analysis of each of these factors and their role in the development and acquisition of weapon systems. 1. Cost: The development of weapon systems is a significant investment for any nation. Budget constraints and allocation of resources become critical factors in determining the feasibility and priority of a weapons system project. Governments and defense organizations aim to keep costs at a minimum without compromising on the functionality and effectiveness of the system. Managing costs effectively ensures that resources are used efficiently, and multiple projects can be pursued simultaneously within the given budget constraints. 2. Schedule: Timely delivery of weapon systems is crucial to maintain the competitiveness of a nation's defense capabilities and align with strategic military objectives. Delays in the development and deployment of weapon systems can have serious implications on national security and international relations. Therefore, managing and mitigating schedule risks is of paramount importance. The approach taken for developing weapon systems should emphasize identifying and mitigating potential delays and bottlenecks in the development process and ensuring timely delivery. 3. Performance: Performance risks refer to the possibility that a weapon system may not meet the desired technical specifications, operational requirements, or could fail under real-world conditions. An effective weapons system is expected to provide a competitive advantage and function reliably in critical situations to fulfill its intended role. Thus, the approach to developing weapon systems should prioritize addressing and mitigating performance risks to maximize the system's effectiveness. Additionally, the interdependence of these factors should also be considered in the approach to weapons systems development. For instance, delays in the schedule could lead to increased costs or performance compromises, while cutting costs could lead to reduced performance or longer delivery times. Therefore, a balanced and well-coordinated approach that manages all these risks simultaneously must be employed. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Schedule, cost, and performance risks are important factors to consider in the approach taken to weapons systems in the next half-decade\\" is true, as evidenced by the given premise and the critical role each factor plays in efficient and effective weapons systems development. The approach to weapons systems should prioritize balancing these three factors and identifying ways to minimize risks associated with each, ultimately resulting in a streamlined, cost-effective, and high-performing weapon system that serves its intended purpose."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Alipay Owner Ant Financial Plans to Go Public Later in 2016 When Jack Ma wanted to take his Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group Holdings, public two years ago, Hong Kong regulators rejected the listing and the company ended up trading on the New York Stock Exchange. But for his next megahit startup, Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group Co., Ma is looking at a local listing before the end of 2016, Bloomberg reported Monday. The company, which runs the popular Alipay digital payment service and operates China’s largest money market fund, meets the requirements for a listing, including being profitable for the past three years. If Ant Financial can attain its most recent private valuation of 60 billion, it would be the biggest IPO in China since 2010, when Agricultural Bank of China listed. The bank hit a value of 128 billion on its first day of trading in Hong Kong. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Alibaba baba once controlled Alipay, but spun off the ownership in 2011 to a separate entity controlled by Ma that evolved into Ant Financial.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Thanks in part to the work of Hanns Scharff and a slew of studies on interrogation techniques, we know it’s best to be genuinely friendly no matter who you’re trying to get information out of.      •      The downed World War II fighter pilot had little reason to be wary. Thus far, his German interrogator had seemed uninterested in extracting military intelligence, and had acted with genuine kindness. He made friendly conversation, shared some of his wife’s delicious baked goods, and took the pilot out for a lovely stroll in the German countryside. So when the interrogator erroneously suggested that a chemical shortage was responsible for American tracer bullets leaving white rather than red smoke, the pilot quickly corrected him with the information German commanders sought. No, there was no chemical shortage; the white smoke was supposed to signal to pilots that they would soon be out of ammunition.      The man prying the information loose was Hanns Scharff, and as Raymond Tolliver chronicles in The Interrogator: The Story of Hanns Joachim Scharff, Master Interrogator of the Luftwaffe, Scharff’s unparalleled success did not come from confrontation or threats, but from simply being nice. With the morality and efficacy of interrogation practices coming under increasing scrutiny, Scharff’s techniques—and questions about the extent to which they work—are taking on greater significance.      The fact that Scharff is even mentioned in criminal justice circles is a historical anomaly. Not only was he never meant be an interrogator, he was never meant to be in the German military at all. In the decade leading up to the war Scharff worked as a businessman in Johannesburg, where he lived with his British wife and two kids. Not exactly a portrait of the threatening Axis enemy Captain America was created to battle.      The Scharff Technique is defined by four key components: 1) a friendly approach, 2) not pressing for information, 3) the illusion of knowing it all, and 4) the confirmation/disconfirmation tactic.      War broke out while Scharff was vacationing in his native Germany. Unable to leave the country, he was eventually drafted into the army. He was destined for the front lines in Russia when his wife talked her way into a general’s office and managed to get Scharff transferred to a unit of interpreters. After a string of additional transfers and coincidences, the last of which was a plane crash that killed his two superiors, Scharff found himself as the lead interrogator for Allied fighter pilots who went down over France and Germany. As a lowly assistant Scharff once saw a prisoner being mistreated, and he vowed to do things differently if he were ever in charge. That core principle was the basis for a strategy so effective a prisoner once quipped that Scharff “could get a confession of infidelity from a Nun.”      There is strong anecdotal evidence of Scharff’s kindness and ability to get what he wanted—in one instance he may have saved the lives of a group of American pilots by persuading the SS to exonerate them from war crime accusations—but researchers have only recently begun systematically testing his techniques to determine if they are actually more effective.      The bulk of the research on Scharff’s strategies comes from the lab of Pär Anders Granhag, a psychology professor at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. In a new study led by Simon Oleszkiewicz, a former student in Granhag’s lab, the “Scharff Technique” was compared with a method know as the “Direct Approach.”      Participants in the experiment were given a story that contained 35 specific pieces of information about a terrorist attack they helped plan—their interrogators knew only a dozen of them—and instructed to say as little as possible while also revealing enough to earn their freedom; they were told that their compensation for participating would reflect their ability to strike this balance. The interrogations were done by phone, and participants had all of the information in front of them during the call. Researchers measured the quantity and accuracy of information that was revealed, and participants were surveyed about the interrogation after the experiment.      The Scharff Technique was defined by four key components: 1) a friendly approach, 2) not pressing for information, 3) the illusion of knowing it all, and 4) the confirmation/disconfirmation tactic. (The latter strategy is when an interrogator presents a claim in the hope that the prisoner will confirm or disconfirm it—it’s what Scharff used to learn about the tracer bullets.) In contrast, the Direct Approach featured direct questions posed in a more businesslike manner. Relative to the Direct Approach, the Scharff Technique interrogators professed a greater understanding of the prisoner’s situation, spent more time describing what they already knew, and probed for five specific pieces of information by making five claims rather than by asking five questions.      The results, which will be published in Law and Human Behavior, revealed that, relative to the Direct Approach, the Scharff Technique elicited more new information and information that was more precise. But given that the Scharff Technique seems better than simple direct questioning, the findings above may not be all that interesting.      What is interesting about Oleszkiewicz’s study is that participants interrogated using the Scharff Technique tended to underestimate how much they divulged, while participants interrogated using the Direct Approach overestimated how much they divulged. This finding mirrored the results of a similar 2013 study led by Granhag and a 2014 study led by Lennart May, a former researcher in Granhag’s lab. The Scharff Technique resulted in more information, and it did so without alerting participants that they were being too chatty.      The research by Granhag’s lab meshes with the findings from a 2013 study (PDF) of 413 interviews involving 58 United Kingdom interrogators and 29 different terror suspects. The study, which was led by the University of Liverpool’s Laurence Alison, found that adaptive interpersonal behavior—being respectful, warm, non-judgmental, etc.—lead to more disclosure, while maladaptive interpersonal behavior—being distrustful, punitive, patronizing, etc.—led to less disclosure.      If Scharff’s techniques are more effective, do modern interrogations reflect their insight? The answer may be closer to yes than Law and Order reruns would have you believe. (That is, if we momentarily ignore the how-dare-you-reduce-it-to-a-parenthetical exception of last decade’s U.S. government sanctioned torture.)      In a new study led by the University of Albany’s Allison Redlich, 152 interrogators, largely drawn from the FBI, U.S. military, state or local police, and the Department of Homeland Security, reported on the techniques they most frequently used as well as they techniques they believed were most effective. Redlich divided 67 different techniques into six domains: rapport and relationship building, context manipulation, emotion provocation, confrontation/competition, collaboration, and presentation of evidence. She found that, compared to confrontational techniques, rapport and relationship building were used more frequently and believed to be more effective. Overall, Redlich’s findings highlight the success of interrogators who understand the importance of friendliness.      The section on intelligence gathering operations in the official U.S. Army Field Manual (PDF), which was last updated in 2006, also stresses the importance of building a friendly rapport with prisoners. While seemingly outdated practices like “Mutt and Jeff”—more commonly known as “good cop, bad cop”—may still be used with special permission, the manual states that “in most cases, either initially or after the interrogation source has begun answering questions, the HUMINT [Human Intelligence] collector will adopt a more relaxed or even sympathetic posture…. The HUMINT collector must control his temper at all times.”      The study found that adaptive interpersonal behavior—being respectful, warm, non-judgmental, etc.—lead to more disclosure.      There is some evidence that more confrontational tactics remain popular, however. In a 2010 whitepaper on police-induced confessions (PDF), Saul Kassin of Williams College reported that the most influential approach is the Reid Technique, which is a set of tactics that may include isolating the suspect, confronting him or her with allegations that may or may not be true, and refusing to accept alibis or denials. Similarly, in a 2007 study (PDF), Kassin found that isolating prisoners from friends and family—a tactic Redlich considered confrontational—was the most popular strategy among a sample of 631 police investigators.      Nevertheless, from 30,000 feet, recent history suggests that interrogators are moving closer to the friendly tactics pioneered by Scharff. Perhaps the deeper question is whether this reflects a broader societal shift toward niceness, not just on the scale of global moral progress, but in terms of the types of quotidian interactions somebody might have with a barista or a cab driver.      IN THE LATE 1970s, University of Michigan political scientist Robert Axelrod invited people to write computer programs that would compete against each other in a prisoner’s dilemma tournament. Programs that chose to cooperate would benefit only if the program they were partnered with also chose to cooperate. Axelrod hoped that the winners who emerged from these repeated interactions would reveal something about the evolution of cooperation. In the end, a simple tit-for-tat program won the tournament. When encountering an unfamiliar opponent, the program initially chose to cooperate. On the second meeting, the program mirrored the behavior of its opponent in the first meeting. The effectiveness of a tit-for-tat strategy whose default was cooperation showed the power of an initial decision to act friendly.      If we include virtual interactions, the range of people a person interacts with each day continues to grow. This essentially means that the number of opportunities to “simulate” strategies for interacting with others continues to grow. If being nice is the winning strategy in modern society, then the increasing number of interactions will increase the speed at which people “learn” to adopt this strategy.      If you’re looking to get information—whether it’s from a co-worker, a partner, or your investor friend who works for the Senate Finance Committee—it’s best to be genuinely friendly. That strategy paid off for Scharff both during and after the war. Though his wife left him, he eventually immigrated to the United States, married an American, and had a successful career as a mosaic artist. One of Scharff’s works fittingly rests in a place known for spreading the gospel of camaraderie between those with stark differences: the Magic Kingdom Castle at Disney World. ||||| This study is on how to elicit intelligence from human sources. We compared the efficacy of two human intelligence gathering techniques: the Scharff-technique (conceptualized as four different tactics) and the Direct Approach (a combination of open and direct questions). Participants (N = 60) were asked to take on the role of \\"sources\\" and were given information about a planned terrorist attack. They were to reveal part of this information in an upcoming interview. Critically, the participants were instructed to strike a balance between not revealing too much or too little information. As predicted, the participants revealed significantly more, and more precise, new information when interviewed with the Scharff-technique (vs. the Direct Approach). Furthermore, and as predicted, the participants in the Scharff condition underestimated how much new information they revealed whereas the participants in the Direct Approach overestimated how much new information they revealed. The study provides rather strong support for the Scharff-technique as an effective human intelligence gathering technique.

American Airlines Flight 11: FAA Awareness. Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American 11, he did not immediately interpret the plane's failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked. At 8:14, when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to 35,000 feet, the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight. He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency. Though there was no response, he kept trying to contact the aircraft. At 8:21, American 11 turned off its transponder, immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft. The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane, although neither suspected a hijacking. The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a \\"no radio\\" aircraft. The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American 11. He became even more concerned as its route changed, moving into another sector's airspace. Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path, and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American 11. At 8:24:38, the following transmission came from American 11: American 11: We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport. The controller only heard something unintelligible; he did not hear the specific words \\"we have some planes.\\" The next transmission came seconds later: American 11: Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"9 minutes\\" correctly answer the question \\"How long was there between the flight failing to heed instructions and the transponder being turned off?\\"?","output":"Yes, the response \\"9 minutes\\" correctly answers the question \\"How long was there between the flight failing to heed instructions and the transponder being turned off?\\". We know this is correct by subtracting the time the flight failed to heed instructions at 8:14 from the time the transponder was turned off at 8:21. This difference gives us 7 minutes, not 9.

Article: Which day is the most important for you? Your birthday, the first day of your work or the day you win a prize. Many teenagers may think their birthday is the happiest time because they can receive many wonderful presents and have much fun with their friends. Others may regard the starting day of their work as the most meaningful. They think it's the first big step in their life and they can depend on themselves. They like to deal with challenges rather than to ask for the help of adults. According to a survey, more than half of the Chinese people, certain ages and birthdays are especially important. One hundred days after a baby's birth has special meaning. On that day, relatives  and friends come to bless the baby. In northern part of China, like Inner Mongolia, a child's 12th birthday is a big day. This is when a child becomes a teenager. Eighteen is another important age, which means you must be responsible  for what you have done in laws. As for adults, maybe the anniversary of their marriage  is the most important. For some old people, the 60th or 70th birthday is also very important.

Given the following context:  Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families  within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and...  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the place that was closed in 1970?

Review:  Film dominated by raven-haired Barbara Steele, it was seen when I was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle, seeking blood. Steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty, and the views of the walking dead pre-date Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD shamblers, unifying them in my mind. I don't see the connection between this film and THE HAUNTING, which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-movie without pretention, daring you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There's no such draw to HAUNTING's overwrought Claire Bloom. The comparisons to the HAUNTING are superficial. And no, this movie does NOT need to be remade. Not only is it a product of the Sixties, but the large percentage of talentless cretins in Hollywood cannot fathom MACABRE's formula for terror. That formula is based on one overriding factor: GOOD WRITING. Low-grade classics like CASTLE and Corman's Poe films with R. Matheson and Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST share a commonality of strong writing. It's simple. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put a plot into today's cinematic mess. Besides that, let Hollywood attempt some original material for a change, and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past. What is the sentiment of this review? Select from: 1. negative; 2. positive;","output":"The sentiment of this review can be classified as a mix between positive and negative.

However, the reviewer expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the idea of remaking the film. They criticize the current state of Hollywood and the lack of originality, as well as the absence of good writers like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie.

Tax row: The French government is demanding £160million from internet retailer Amazon in unpaid tax. The internet giant Amazon has received a £159million demand from France for unpaid taxes. The figure includes fines and interest in relation to 'the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions'. European nations including Britain are clamping down on US firms that channel their vast profits through low-tax countries. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Amazon, Starbucks and Google should all be punished for not paying their 'fair share' of tax. She has called for consumers to boycott the firms in protest against what she describes as 'immoral' tax avoidance here. But Amazon said it might go to court to fight the French tax claim, which relates to four years from 2006. A report by the company says: 'We disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it.' Amazon's public policy chief for Europe, Andrew Cecil, appeared before the public accounts committee on Monday, and the French demand was referred to during the hearing. The company keeps its tax bill down in European countries by channelling money through Luxembourg, which offers generous concessions to businesses. Google, which channels its profits through Ireland, is also being audited by the French tax authorities. Andrew Cecil, Director Public Policy at Amazon, received a grilling at a commons committee hearing over the company's tax strategy. Amazon has also run into problems with the tax authorities in other countries, with American and Japanese officials both forcing the company to ‘reach an agreement’ on the allocation of the company’s earnings between 2006 and 2012. The company has also revealed that it is under investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service over its tax returns for the two years from 2005. The company is also facing demands for taxes dating back to 2003 from countries including China, Germany, and Luxembourg, as well as Britain. Google is currently being audited by the French, although the company has denied a report that it the Paris tax authorities want 1 billion in back taxes. Yesterday, Andrew Cecil the online retailer's. public policy director, told the commons committee that the business's. turnover in 2011 was £7.3billion yet it paid. taxes of just £6.4million. Amazon employs nearly 70,000 people world-wide. Last year, it turned over more than 48bn revenue. The company was founded in 1994. But since then has grown into the biggest online retailed in the world. It is estimated to be worth 102.51bn. Some 65million customers log on to its U.S. website each month. It paid no UK tax in 2010 on revenues of. £3.3billion. MPs were furious that he refused to reveal how much the company made from its British arm. 'It's quite insulting to our. intelligence that you claim you don't know what sales you make in the. UK,' said Liberal Democrat MP Ian Swales, a member of the influential. Commons committee. Mr Cecil claimed that Luxembourg,. which employs around 500 people, was the real 'engine' of the business,. rather than the UK, where it employs 15,000. Its profits are booked in Luxembourg,. with the UK figuring only as a 'service arm'. MPs said his answers were. 'evasive' and 'annoying' and Margaret Hodge said the committee would. call 'a serious person' for further questioning. She said Mr Cecil's ignorance was 'outrageous' and that he had 'been put up' to it by the company. The parliamentary committee, which is. also examining the tax affairs of Google and Starbucks,  said it would. be summoning a more senior Amazon executive to answer their questions. It is not just in Europe that Amazon has run into problems with the tax authorities. In its statement to the SEC, it revealed that US and Japanese tax authorities had reached an agreement on the allocation of the company's earnings between those two countries for 2006-12. The cost to Amazon of this settlement was 'not significant', it said. The company however also revealed that it remains under investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service over its tax returns for 2005 and 2006. It also admitted that there was a chance of the company being hit by demands for taxes dating back to 2003 in 'various states and other foreign jurisdictions' including China, Germany, Luxembourg, and Britain.

In 1918, while teaching in Geneva, Szigeti met and fell in love with Wanda Ostrowska. She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The structure outlined above probably won’t apply for most college entrance exams: though its simplicity makes it very handy for quick, inconspicuous bios, the whole point when applying to college is to stand out. The best way to do this is to make the structure your own by telling a story, not outlining key factoids. There are many possible structures to choose from, including:   Chronological: This structure starts at the beginning and ends at the end. It’s the most straightforward and works well if you’ve had an interesting life that has taken you from A to B to C in unusual or impressive ways (for example, truly beating the odds).  Circular: This structure start at an important or climactic moment (D), backtracks (A), and then explains all the events leading up to that moment (B, C), eventually bringing the reader full circle. This is good for building suspense, especially when Event D is so strange or unbelievable that the reader doesn’t mind being led around for a bit.  Zoomed In: This structure focuses on one critical event (for example, C) to symbolically tell a larger story. It might use a few small, surrounding details (a, d) to orient the reader, but otherwise, the moment is important enough to stand on its own. Colleges want to hear your life story so that they can figure out whether or not you’re a good fit for them. That said, showing how good a match you are for the school doesn’t mean getting sidetracked by trying to describe the school as well.   Incorrect: \\"UCSF has one of the top-ranked research-based med schools in the world, which would provide me with the foundation necessary to achieve my lifelong dream of becoming a doctor.\\" The school you’re applying to already knows what its programs and facilities are like, so don’t waste the reader’s time. On top of that, praising the school at the expense of describing yourself makes you sound unworthy to attend.  Correct: \\"Watching a trauma surgeon save my brother’s life at the age of five is a moment I’ll never forget. Since that day, I’ve known without a doubt that I would dedicate my life to medicine. My brother was lucky that his surgeon studied at one of the best programs in the country. By doing the same, I hope to one day mean to another family what Dr. Heller does to mine.\\"This description of the narrator is on-point, personal, and memorable. Though it still subtly praises the UCSF facilities, it doesn’t sound like it’s trying to score brownie points. Even if you manage to do it well, which is hard when you’re not inspired by truth, the best that will happen is that you will seem like hundreds or thousands of other students who used the same strategy. Instead, talk about what’s real and what matters to you. Don’t have the most amazing life? Embrace it – and whatever you do, don’t fight above your weight class. Trying to force a ho-hum story to be more dramatic will just make it look silly, especially compared to the truly epic tales some of your co-applicants will have.   Incorrect: \\"Reading The Great Gatsby was a pivotal moment in my life that made me completely rethink my own preconceptions about what it means to live in modern America. Thanks to that assignment, I now know I want to pursue American Studies.\\"  Correct: \\"My family’s ties to this country aren’t particularly glamorous. We didn’t arrive on the Mayflower, or have our surname butchered at Ellis Island, or receive amnesty after fleeing a foreign dictatorship. What we did is settle in four states across the Midwest, where we’ve lived happily for over a hundred years. The magic of that simple act isn’t lost on me, which is why I’ve chosen to major in American Studies.\\" That’s what your SATs were for. While you shouldn’t use slang or dumb your essay down, your content should speak for itself; going nutty with the vocabulary will just be a distraction. Plus, the admissions board slogs through you-don’t-even-want-to-know-how-many essays every year, and the last thing they want to hear is another person trying to wrestle a five-syllable word into a place where it has no earthly business.   Incorrect: \\"Having had a rather minimalistic upbringing, I find that I continue to assiduously value hard work and frugality above all else.\\"Unless you’re a Dickensian countess or one of Jane Austen’s comic relief characters, this just doesn’t work. It sounds like you're trying too hard.  Correct: \\"Growing up very poor taught me that hard work and thrift are sometimes the only things a person can afford.\\" Impactful and to-the-point – all with no words longer than two syllables. This is one of the most important things you can do to help your bio stand out. Many students will state things like \\"I learned a valuable lesson from this experience\\" or \\"I developed a new understanding of X.\\" Showing through concrete detail is much more effective.   Incorrect: \\"I learned a lot from my experience as a camp counselor.\\"This says nothing about what you actually learned, and is a sentence that will probably be in hundreds of college bios.  Correct: \\"I came out of my time as a camp counselor with a better understanding of empathy and connection than I had previously. Now, when I see my younger sister acting up, I understand better how to help her without sounding bossy or controlling.\\" The \\"passive voice\\" occurs when you use forms of the verb to be, and it usually makes your sentences wordier and unclear. Using active, present-tense verbs makes your writing more alive and interesting. Consider the difference between the following sentences: \\"The window was broken by the zombie\\" and \\"The zombie broke the window.\\" In the first, you have no idea whether the window by the zombie just happened to be broken. The second is very clear: the zombie broke the window, and you need to hit the road.

Video footage of the incident shows the truck veering off course after driving over the top of a row of cars, then knocking down a guardrail and driving into a group of onlookers.      The mayor of the eastern city of Haaksbergen, Hans Gerritsen, said at a news conference that one child and two adults were killed in the incident, and 15 others were injured, according to Dutch national broadcaster NOS.      Earlier, Gerritsen had told the broadcaster two children were killed.      Local police couldn't immediately be reached to confirm the number of dead. Ambulances and emergency services were quickly on the scene, including a trauma helicopter from Germany.      One of the show's organizers, Geerlof Kanis, told local broadcaster RTV Oost that the city had granted a permit for the event, which is held annually in the town's center. He said safety fences kept onlookers at a sufficient distance from the show. He speculated that either the truck's gas pedal got stuck or its brakes failed.      In footage of the incident posted to social media, the truck revs its engine after rolling over the row of cars, and then begins to turn. As it becomes clear the truck is on a crash course with the guard rail, around 30 people in the truck's path fall back or jump away. The truck then lurches to a stop, with many onlookers screaming and panicking.      Kanis said the truck's driver is being questioned by police. ||||| Monster truck crashes into crowd; At least 2 dead, Dozens hurt      Dozens of adults and children were injured Sunday at an automotive exhibition when a driver lost control of his monster truck, crashing into the attendees gathered at the Haaksbergen, Overijssel event. Police say two people lost their lives, though Mayor Hans Gerritsen said three people are dead. It was previously reported that at least one of those dead is a child.      Sources at the scene say about 40 victims were being triaged at the scene. Emergency services called for all available medical personnel in the area to assist first responders.      Video from the scene (see below) shows the driver gunning the truck’s engine before powering over half a dozen cars. The engine revs hard after the truck’s rear wheels clears the last car, and the truck hits the pavement hard, before careening around a curve, jumping a metal railing and crashing into a crowd. The first call to emergency services came just after 4 p.m.      The crowd looks to have been corralled approximately three or four truck lengths from the main exhibition area. People were attending the AutoMotorSportief on Stationsstraat in the center of the small town.      “A lovely, festive afternoon ended in drama,” said Deputy Mayor Peter van Vlaanderen. “This is a disaster for Haaksbergen.”      The truck is sponsored by Dutch firm Eurol, a manufacturer of industrial lubricants. The truck is part of the stunt team the company funds.      Emergency services raised the alarm to a third-degree regional incident (GRIP 3), normally reserved for when a municipality is affected by an incident. By ordering the GRIP 3 alarm, the National Crisis Centre, interior ministry, and commissioner of Overijssel have all been notified.

Instead, the truck ploughed into a group of onlookers who were separated from the show only by flimsy metal barriers. Amateur video footage posted on Facebook captured the horrific incident. In response, local police arrested the driver, and multiple air ambulance helicopters from the region, including one from neighboring Germany, arrived at the scene to assist the injured. The injured were taken to hospitals in three nearby towns. Following the devastating event, an inquiry was opened by the police, and the driver was detained."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The race kicked off in Nové Město, the Czech Republic, and finished in Val di Fiemme, Italy, ten days later. It featured 8 top international cross-country skiing competitions, of which two were sprint events. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Tour de Ski is modeled after the cycling competition known as the Tour de France","output":"While it is true that both the Tour de Ski and the Tour de France are multi-stage races featuring various routes and terrain, the similarities primarily end here. The Tour de Ski is a cross-country skiing competition, while the Tour de France is a professional bicycle road race. Besides the obvious difference in the sport being practiced, there are other distinctions that make it difficult to draw a clear conclusion that the Tour de Ski is modeled after the Tour de France. Firstly, let us understand the 2007-08 Tour de Ski in a bit of detail. As mentioned, it consisted of 8 international cross-country skiing competitions, with two sprint events. Participants needed to excel in various cross-country skiing techniques such as classic and freestyle skiing. These races took place across multiple countries, starting in the Czech Republic and finishing in Italy. Some key aspects of the event include the pursuit race, the mass start, and the final climb up Alpe Cermis in Val di Fiemme, Italy. In comparison, the Tour de France is a 21-stage race taking place predominantly within France, covering distance totalling around 3,500 kilometers. It is held annually and has taken place since 1903, with few exceptions. The race includes various terrains like mountains, flat stages, and time trials. Over the years, the race has witnessed diverse sub-competitions such as the points classification (green jersey), the mountains classification (polka-dot jersey), and the best young rider classification (white jersey). Notably, the general classification (yellow jersey) is awarded to the cyclist with the lowest cumulative time across all stages and is the most prestigious prize of the event. Now, it is crucial to analyze the similarities and differences between the two competitions: 1. Similarities: - Both the Tour de Ski and the Tour de France are multi-stage races that require athletes to be versatile and adapt to different stages and terrains. - The competitions are recognized as prestigious events in their respective sports, attracting top athletes from around the world. - Both events have stages that feature climbing, showcasing the athletes' endurance and determination. 2. Differences: - The sports practiced are different; the Tour de Ski is a cross-country skiing competition while the Tour de France is a road cycling race. - The duration and number of stages differ, with the Tour de Ski lasting for a little over a week with 8 stages, whereas the Tour de France spans approximately three weeks with 21 stages. - The Tour de France covers more distance and primarily occurs within a single country. Conversely, the Tour de Ski takes place across multiple countries (Czech Republic to Italy in the 2007-08 edition). - The Tour de France includes various sub-competitions with corresponding classifications (jerseys), while the Tour de Ski does not have these specific sub-competitions. In conclusion, although there are some similarities between the Tour de Ski and the Tour de France, it is not accurate to state that the Tour de Ski is modeled entirely after the Tour de France. Each competition possesses unique characteristics and caters to its own sport, with varying race structures, durations, and locations. It is essential to recognize that while they share some resemblances, the Tour de Ski and the Tour de France are distinctive competitions in their own right."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's solve this math problem together step by step. We have this equation: -2*s + 38 = 50 Our goal is to find what 's' is. So, we'll move things around to have 's' all by its own. First, let's subtract 38 from both sides of the equation to get: -2*s = 50 - 38 Now, let's do the subtraction on the right side: -2*s = 12 Next, we need to get rid of the -2 in front of the 's'. To do this, we'll divide both sides by -2 (because -2 divided by -2 is 1, and we want 1s or just s on the left side). So we get: s = 12 ÷ -2 Finally, let's do the division: s = -6 There you go, buddy! The answer is s = -6. Good job!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Your first question is about meeting a celebrity, important person, or someone you know while arranging a special kind of friendship on social media.

Security Council voted to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya. That's part of the military operation that's been firing missiles and running airstrikes. It's been led by the U.S. Yesterday, there was talk of a deal that would make NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the leader of the operation. But that wasn't set in stone, and there was some doubt about it.

News article: Tegan & Sara offer sublime synthpop catharsis on ‘Love You to Death’ The line between love and hate may be thin, but to hear sisters Tegan & Sara Quin sing it, slimmer still is the line between romantic love and feeling drained of life. The Canadian duo puts a 21st-century spin on New Romanticism, the early-’80s subgenre that trafficked in grand gestures and sparkling keyboards. It’s a good fit; tracks like “That Girl” and “Boyfriend” focus on minutiae that can seem mortally important in the hypercharged context of capital-R Relationships, and the pillowy synthpop beds crafted by superproducer Greg Kurstin (Adele, Kelly Clarkson) simultaneously cushion and enhance the psychic blows described within. The Quins’ voices give songs like “Faint of Heart” extra dramatic heft, while adding anxious shades to the steely-eyed façade of “Hang on to the Night.” Tegan & Sara’s new New Romanticism reflects the emotional spectrum that comes with love, then covers that mirror image in glitter and pomp — a catharsis that sounds sublime even when it feels oh so bad.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which potato was most likely stored in a warm environment?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full of the person that influenced Christian doctrine?  By the end of the medieval period a complex body of customary law had come into existence dealing with the four \\"Mendip mineries\\". That the medieval control was in the hands of the monastic foundations may indicate some continuity of tenure of large-scale holdings, focused on the mines, from the Roman period.William Wilberforce's visit to Cheddar in 1789, during which he saw the poor circumstances of the locals, inspired Hannah More to begin her work improving the conditions of the Mendip miners and agricultural workers. Under her influence, schools were built and children were formally instructed in reading and Christian doctrine. Between 1770 and 1813 some 7,300 ha (18,000 acres) of land on the hills were enclosed, mainly with dry stone walls that today form a key part of the landscape. In 2006 funding was obtained to maintain and improve the walls, which had steadily deteriorated over the years. Over 300 \\"Mendip Motor Cars\\" were built by an engineering works based in Chewton Mendip in the years immediately before and after World War I. In World War II a bombing decoy was constructed on top of Black Down at Beacon Batch in an attempt to confuse bombers aiming to damage the city of Bristol, and piles of stones (known as cairns) were created to prevent enemy aircraft using the hilltop as a landing site.In the 1960s, the tallest mast in the region at 293 metres (961 ft) above ground level, the Mendip UHF television transmitter, was installed on Pen Hill near Wells, one of the highest points of the Mendips. The transmitter's antenna rises to almost 589 metres (1,932 ft) above sea level. Since 2003, arguments have raged over plans to erect a wind turbine near Chewton Mendip. The proposal was initially rejected by Mendip District Council, which enjoyed the support of a range of local groups and organisations, on the grounds that the environmental impact on the edge of the AONB outweighed the nominal amount of electricity which would be generated. In April 2006, however, a planning enquiry gave Ecotricity...

Here is an article: \\"To just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the 'basket of deplorables,'\\" Hillary Clinton said at a New York fundraiser on Sept. 9. \\"The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that, and he has lifted them up.\\" (Video: The Washington Post / Photo: AP) Substantive policy issues once again took a back seat as the presidential campaign refocused on name-calling over the weekend. At a fundraiser on Friday night, Hillary Clinton said, “You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of [Donald] Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic — you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that.” She then went on to call these people “irredeemable.” What is, in fact, deplorable is not only that Clinton said this but that she apparently believes it. There’s no question that Trump is running a xenophobic campaign that’s pandering to white nationalism and that a portion of his base enthusiastically embraces overtly anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, misogynistic and racist views. But a far wider percentage of Trump’s supporters fall into a gray area of more generalized resentment that is partly about identity but also about economic suffering. Clinton and liberals in general should be reaching out to these voters, not offending them. Many of Trump’s working-class white voters are resentful that the American Dream is slipping further from their grasp. They’re right to feel this way. On average, their wages have effectively stagnated or declined over the past several decades. And for the same period of time, conservatives have been systematically trying to convince white working-class voters that they shouldn’t blame Republicans who vote against infrastructure jobs and minimum-wage increases while they give major tax breaks to the rich, and they shouldn’t blame big corporations that have slashed wages and shipped jobs overseas while turning record profits. No, they should blame immigrants and black folks for supposedly stealing “their jobs” or lazing about on welfare benefits that come out of “their pockets.” Either unaware of or ignoring the fact that most people on welfare are white and average wages for people of color are still well below average wages for white folks, struggling whites see other long-suffering communities achieve even a wisp of a rhetorical promise of equal opportunity and feel as though they are, therefore, on the losing end. When the top 10 percent of Americans control 76 percent of the wealth, that leaves just a little sliver left to be divided up among everyone else. And so it’s easy to resent the other people who are making claims for more of that sliver — especially if you’ve been encouraged for decades to fight over the crumbs instead of fighting against the truly powerful and wealthy elite; and especially if that encouragement builds on centuries of racial antagonism. [Trump sees black America as a dystopian hellhole. So do most white people.] The Republican strategy to deliberately stoke racial resentment to attract the loyalty of white voters who, like voters of color, are actually directly and overtly harmed by Republican policies — this is irredeemable. But the voters themselves are not. Their hopes and dreams are deeply inspiring and deeply American. And their anger and frustration with economic inequality is absolutely spot on. The problem is the solution they’ve been sold by the GOP. Ending affirmative action, cutting the minimum wage, slashing food stamps, repealing the Affordable Care Act and deregulating corporations won’t put the American Dream back within the reach of millions of struggling Americans. In fact, it will put that dream even further out of reach. The reality is that working people of all races fare far better under Democratic presidents and Democratic policies. Clinton needs to reach out to all voters and tell them this truth — and confront racial resentment without labeling everyone who considers it racist. I know that we live in a deeply divided, partisan era, and that to some extent Clinton was just acknowledging that. And again, a portion of Trump’s base really is explicitly fueled by a racially tinged and xenophobic vitriol to which he has given plain comfort. Clinton is right to call that out — as she did in her speech on Friday as well as in her apology thereafter. But more broadly, what we need is a candidate — and a president — comfortable in the complexities in between, the space occupied by the vast majority of white Americans who aren’t explicit racial supremacists but who do harbor biases that cloud their judgments. Of course we have that in President Obama, arguably one of the most thoughtful leaders on issues of race and racial justice to ever occupy the Oval Office. And yet, because he’s black, he can’t speak about race without being seen by many whites as biased. If a white president said that if he were black, Trayvon Martin could be his son, he would be hailed as bold and visionary. But when Obama makes this very obvious point, the right attacks him for divisive race baiting. Saying that those who point out racial bias are the racists is like saying that the person who pulls the fire alarm must have started the fire. How are we going to do something about a problem if we don’t even talk about it? White people — including white politicians — have far more leeway to talk about race in America. We need a white president who can be a part of this much-needed conversation in our country and can help be a bridge to white voters who are feeling alienated and disaffected — rather than pushing those Americans away. [White people think racism is getting worse. Against white people.] Recently, the brilliant black public intellectual Heather McGhee was on C-SPAN when a white man from North Carolina called in for advice. He talked about how he knows he’s prejudiced, but thinks his prejudices are justified and he feels afraid of black people. And then, stunningly, he asked McGhee, “What can I do to change? You know, to be a better American?” That in and of itself was remarkable and wonderful. But then McGhee offered a model of compassion and leadership that everyone — black, brown and white — should follow. She expressed gratitude to the caller. “Thank you so much for being honest and for opening up this conversation because it is simply one of the most important ones we have to have in this country,” McGhee said. She offered the caller an olive branch, pointing out that people of all races actually hold unconscious prejudices. With a warm smile on her face and an unmistakable tone of kindness in her voice, she offered some advice, including expanding his social network to include black families and reading more about the history of race and racism in America. I don’t know if that caller is planning to vote for Trump, but there are many white voters like him who are. We shouldn’t tell them they’re deplorable. In fact, we shouldn’t tell them anything at all. We should listen to their anger and their concerns and try to understand. They’ve been told that there is no place for them in the pluralistic future of America. That is simply not true. “Stronger Together” shouldn’t just be a slogan on a campaign poster. Clinton needs to help all voters feel and understand that they have a place in her vision for America, not leave anyone behind.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending.

The blue ringed octopus The blue ringed octopus is not a very big creature but it is very dangerous. These octopuses are found all around Australian coast. They often lie in rock pools close to shore. The blue ringed octopus is usually a dull color1 but it shows its bright blue rings when it is in danger. If it is taken out of the water, it is able to bite a person and poison them. If this creature bites someone, they will feel numbness   around the mouth, face and neck. Puffer Fish Puffer Fish are found in all Australian seas. They are very easy to catch but must not be eaten because their flesh and internal organs contain a poison. Anyone who does eat the flesh can become sick very quickly. They may even stop breathing. The Blue Bottle The Blue Bottle is found in most Australian waters. Blue Bottles float lightly on the surface of the water but their tentacles   can be as long as 10 metres. Blue Bottles are much less dangerous than some other jellyfish but they can give a swimmer a bad sting   if the swimmer accidentally touches them. Stingrays      There are many different kinds of stingrays in Australian waters. They usually swim and feed on the bottom of the sea. Accidents can happen if people stand on them or try to pick them up. Stingrays have a sting on their tail. These stings have poison on them. If someone is stung the wound can easily become infected.

A life cycle, in this context, refers to the series of stages through which an organism passes, from its inception as a seed (or as an embryo or spore, in the case of other organisms) to its adulthood, and finally to the production of new seeds, embryos, or spores. The life cycle of a plant is a complex process that involves various stages, including germination, growth, reproduction, and death. Each stage of a plant's life cycle serves a specific function and is essential for the survival and reproduction of the species. The primary stages in a plant's life cycle are as follows: 1. Seed formation: The life cycle of a plant begins with the formation of seeds. A seed is created when the female ovule of a plant is fertilized by male pollen, through a process called pollination. Inside the seed is an embryo, which contains the genetic information and nutrients needed to begin a new life as a plant. 2. Germination: The process of germination occurs when conditions are favorable for the seed to develop into a new plant. These conditions typically include the right combination of warmth, moisture, and sunlight. During germination, the outer seed coat breaks open, allowing the embryonic plant (radicle) to emerge and begin to grow roots. The shoot (plumule) then starts to grow upward, pushing its way through the soil to reach sunlight. 3. Growth: Once the plant has emerged from the soil, it enters the vegetative growth stage. During this stage, the plant develops roots, stems, and leaves through a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis allows the plant to convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (a sugar), which provides the energy necessary for growth. 4. Reproduction: When the plant has reached maturity, it begins to reproduce by producing flowers. The flowers are the reproductive structures of the plant, containing both male and female parts. The male parts produce pollen, which is spread by wind, insects, or other animals to the female parts of another flower on either the same plant or a different plant of the same species. Successful pollination leads to the formation of seeds, which are then dispersed by various means, such as wind, water, or animals, to new locations where they can germinate and start the life cycle again. 5. Death: After seeds have been produced, the plant may die, depending on its species and specific life cycle. Some plants, called annuals, complete their life cycle within one growing season, producing seeds before dying. Other plants, called perennials, can live and reproduce for multiple growing seasons before eventually dying. In summary, the continuous changes of a seed to an adult plant that produces seeds is known as a life cycle. This cycle consists of a series of stages, including germination, growth, reproduction, and death, which are essential for the survival and propagation of the plant species."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Math Problem Solve -14*p = 8*p - 4*p for p.","output":"To solve for p in the equation -14*p = 8*p - 4*p, we first need to simplify the equation by combining like terms on the right side. The equation is: -14*p = 8*p - 4*p Now, let's combine the terms on the right side: 8*p - 4*p = 4*p So, the simplified equation becomes: -14*p = 4*p Now we will isolate p by combining the terms involving p on one side of the equation. In this case, we will add 14*p to both sides of the equation to move it to the right side: -14*p + 14*p = 4*p + 14*p This simplifies to: 0 = 18*p Now, to find the value of p, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 18: 0 / 18 = 18*p / 18 Which simplifies to: 0 = p So, in the given equation -14*p = 8*p - 4*p, the value of p is 0."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yosemite Sam is the royal chef for a spoiled king (a caricature of Charles Laughton, who frequently played kings and similar heads of state).  On his way back to the castle from grocery shopping, Sam complains that the king never thanks him for his hard work in having to both pick up groceries and prepare meals three times every day, but that the king instead whines that Sam takes too long with preparing the meals, much to Sam's annoyance (\\"Cook!

After Sam prepares the king's latest meal, which consists of \\"Cornish Hen a la Westchester\\" and \\"Prime Rib of Mutton au Jus with kreplach Sauce Bordelaise,\\" the king just kicks the dishes away and orders Sam to take it all away.  He then tells Sam he's fed up with having \\"variety\\" at his meals.  Wanting something different for real, the king orders Sam to fix him some hasenpfeffer.  Sam agrees to carry out the king's request, but doesn't know what hasenpfeffer is.

Summarize this article: It's no secret that hair will grow just where you don't want it. If you have unwanted hair that shows around your bikini in the back, try waxing or shaving to remove it. You can also use a hair removal cream to remove unwanted hair, but be sure to test it on a small patch of skin first to see if it irritates your skin. Use a gentle all over scrub in the shower to help remove dead skin. Removing dead skin will make your skin feel softer and appear smoother. Use a tanning lotion or cream to give your skin that sun-kissed look without actually using the sun or a tanning bed. Simply use a mirror to apply the cream evenly to your body, making sure to go lightly on problem areas such as your knees, elbows, and face. Make sure you try on your bathing suit before tanning to ensure you cover all the skin that's showing, including the area around your butt.  For a glamorous-looking tan, try products like Shiseido Brilliant Bronze Tinted Self Tanning Gel or Clarins Intense Bronze Self Tanning Tint, both of which were rated highly by Total Beauty. Be warned, though, they can be a little pricey.  The best tanning creams today don't use a dye or stain. Rather, they use DHA to actually change the color of your skin. Use a moisturizing lotion when you get out of the shower or before bedtime to keep your skin healthy and looking smooth. Not everyone looks good in the same bikini, so pick the right one for your body.  If you curve at your hips and thighs, opt for a bikini with a high cut, as other bikinis may cut you off strangely. In addition, this cut will add visual inches to your legs, making them appear longer. Try a string bikini, as it can accommodate your curves.  If your problem area is your stomach, opt for boy shorts with stomach control. Not only will it slim down your stomach, the suit will highlight you summer-ready bikini butt.  If you are larger in your butt and thighs, try a bikini with ruffles and a small skirt. A small skirt can help hide problem areas, and ruffles add length, meaning you can adjust it up or down as needed.  If you're athletic, try a string bikini. String bikinis add less bulk to your already muscular body.  Avoid shiny materials. Shiny material will show every bump on your body, highlighting problem areas. Opt for solid bikinis in cool colors instead. Salt can make you bloated, which can make everything look bigger in a bikini. Use herbs instead of salt at meals, and check menus for low-sodium options. Also, always read labels, as many products have added salt. Using correct posture will help your whole body look better, as it lifts up problem areas and pulls the skin tighter. You may not have the exact bikini butt you want, but that shouldn't stop you from splashing in the waves or jumping in the pool with your best girlfriends.","output":"The article suggests various methods to look and feel better in a bikini.

How is it determined? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose your answer from: (i). no (ii). yes","output":"(i). no The two questions provided are not the same. They each focus on different elements and aspects. I will now provide detailed answers for each question individually. 1. How do you determine propane's burning temperature? To determine propane's burning temperature, it's essential to understand the factors which influence the combustion process, such as pressure, air-to-fuel ratios, and available oxygen. Propane's standard burning temperature lies within the range of 1900°C to 1999°C (3450°F to 3620°F). Combustion temperature usually depends on the mixture of fuel in the air. This can be further expanded into three general categories: - Adiabatic Flame Temperature: Refers to the highest theoretical temperature that could be reached in the combustion process if no heat is lost to the surroundings. This value is usually calculated with the help of thermodynamic principles and material properties like densities, heat capacities, and combustion enthalpies. - Stoichiometric Combustion: Refers to the ideal air-to-fuel ratio in which propane burns with all its oxygen, producing maximum heat. Under stoichiometric conditions, the burning temperature is the highest among all air/fuel ratio mixtures. This can be determined using principles of stoichiometric chemistry to obtain the exact air-to-fuel ratio for propane, which is approximately 15.7:1. - Real-World Combustion: It's important to consider that real-world combustion seldom reaches stoichiometric or adiabatic flame conditions. Thus, the actual burning temperature is generally lower than these theoretical values. In practice, propane burning temperatures are influenced by many factors, such as pressure, humidity, impurities, nozzle and burner design, and heat loss to the atmospheric surroundings. Therefore, to determine propane's burning temperature, one must consider factors like air-to-fuel ratios, the availability of oxygen, fuel conditions, and heat loss to the environment, among others. 2. What is hydrogen's state of matter at room temperature? How is it determined? At room temperature (around 25°C or 77°F) and under typical atmospheric pressure, hydrogen exists in a gaseous state. As one of the lightest elements, hydrogen has a low boiling point of -252.87°C (-423.17°F) and a melting point of -259.16°C (-434.49°F). These properties explain why it remains in a gaseous state under standard room temperatures. The state of matter of any element is determined by the balance between the kinetic energy of the particles and the strength of the forces of attraction between them. For hydrogen, the kinetic energy of its particles at room temperature is greater than the intermolecular forces that could cause it to condense into a liquid or solid state. The strength of these intermolecular forces is related to factors such as the size and mass of the particles, polarity of molecules, and available orbital electrons. Another contributing factor is the presence of hydrogen bonds, which are typically weaker in hydrogen gas as each hydrogen atom only has one electron. These weak bonds result in low intermolecular forces exerted between hydrogen molecules, making them easily overcome by the kinetic energy possessed by those molecules at room temperature. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same, as the first pertains to propane's burning temperature, while the second question deals with hydrogen's state of matter at room temperature and the determining factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"To determine the sentiment of this product review, let's break it down step by step: 1. \\"As far as charging up the battery it does a great job.\\" - This statement conveys a positive sentiment, as it compliments the charger's performance in charging the battery. 2. \\"However, you can't get the battery out once you've gotten it charged.\\" - This statement conveys a negative sentiment, as it highlights a significant issue in removing the battery once it's charged. 3. \\"I almost sent it back but didn't want to lose my battery since I couldn't get it out of the charger.\\" - This statement also indicates a negative sentiment, as the user considered returning the product due to the battery removal issue. 4. \\"I finally used a very thin screw driver to pry it out of the charger.\\" - Although the user found a workaround, this statement can be considered negative, as it suggests the need for an additional tool to address the product's flaw. 5. \\"I just have to make sure I have a tool to remove the battery.\\" - This statement is more neutral, as it implies the user's acceptance of the workaround. From these statements, 1 out of 5 is positive, 3 out of 5 are negative, and 1 is more neutral in nature.

Sentence 2: The pressure will intensify today, with national coverage of the final round planned by ESPN and words that are even more difficult. Both sentences share common elements like the concept of pressure increasing, national coverage of the final round, and ESPN's involvement. However, there are also differences between the sentences; in Sentence 1, the pressure is described as \\"rising\\" on Thursday, while Sentence 2 mentions that the pressure \\"will intensify today\\". Additionally, Sentence 2 provides insight into the reason for this intensification, which is that \\"words that are even more difficult\\" will be encountered, an aspect that is not present in Sentence 1. In summary, the two sentences have a moderate level of similarity, as they share some common elements. However, there are differences in the phrasing and details provided. I would rate the similarity between these sentences as a 3 out of 5, with 0 representing \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 representing that the sentences \\"mean the same thing\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The narrator seems to have experienced an injury on their hand that involves a horseshoe-shaped wound located over the knuckle. This injury bled profusely, indicating a potentially deep or severe cut or puncture. In addition to the main wound, there are two smaller puncture wounds located above it, towards the hand. To treat this injury, the narrator applied hydrogen peroxide, which is often used as an antiseptic for cleaning minor wounds, and then covered the area with a bandage to protect the wound and facilitate the healing process. From this information, it can be inferred that the narrator has taken initiative to treat their injury by themselves using the available resources, such as hydrogen peroxide and a bandage, potentially possessing some basic knowledge of first aid or wound care.

The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) is a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution designed to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex; it seeks to end the legal distinctions between men and women in terms of divorce, property, employment, and other matters. The ERA was originally written by Alice Paul and Crystal Eastman. The amendment was introduced in Congress for the first time in 1921 and has prompted conversations about the meaning of legal equality for women and men ever since. was the equal rights amendment ratified and added to the constitution?","output":"The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was not ratified and added to the United States Constitution. While it was originally written and introduced in Congress in 1921, it took many years before the ERA gained significant momentum. In 1972, the ERA finally got the congressional approval it needed. By a two-thirds majority vote, the United States House of Representatives passed the ERA on October 12, 1971, followed by the United States Senate on March 22, 1972. At that time, Congress set a seven-year deadline for the required number of states to ratify the amendment, which was originally till March 22, 1979. The United States Constitution requires that an amendment be ratified by three-fourths of the states, which would be 38 states since there are 50 states in the country. However, by the 1979 deadline, only 35 states had ratified the ERA. Recognizing the widespread support for the amendment and hoping to secure the remaining state ratifications, Congress extended the ERA's ratification deadline to June 30, 1982. Despite the extension, no additional states ratified the ERA prior to the 1982 deadline. After the deadline, several states took actions, with some voting to ratify the ERA, and others rescinding their previous ratifications. However, these post-deadline actions have been subject to legal debate and challenge, and no consensus has been reached on their legitimacy. In January 2020, Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the ERA, long after the deadline had passed. While this might have fulfilled the numerical requirement for ratification, the expired deadline raises legal and procedural questions over the amendment's present status and validity. In summary, the Equal Rights Amendment has not been ratified and added to the United States Constitution due to lack of ratifications from the required number of states within the specified deadlines. The current status of the ERA remains a topic of debate, facing legal and procedural challenges. However, it continues to be a symbol of the ongoing fight for gender equality and inspires reform efforts at both the state and federal levels in the United States."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command.

It is important to note that the first statement seems to provide specific details, including references to the Boston Red Sox and companies associated with Boston. This suggests that the location in question might be very close to, or in, the city of Boston. The scene described consists of the crowd gathering in front of two buildings and appears to be set in a busy or urban environment with signage as its most distinctive feature. On the other hand, \\"Go Bulls!\\" is a phrase of encouragement or support, usually for a sports team. It does not provide any contextual details about the location or the people being referred to.

Question: Information:  - The Lombard League (Italian and Lombard: ) was a medieval alliance formed in 1167, supported by the Pope, to counter the attempts by the Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Emperors to assert influence over the Kingdom of Italy as a part of the of the Holy Roman Empire. At its apex, it included most of the cities of Northern Italy, but its membership changed with time. With the death of the third and last Hohenstaufen emperor, Frederick II, in 1250, it became obsolete and was disbanded.  - King of Italy (Latin: \\"Rex Italiae\\"; Italian: \\"Re d'Italia\\") was the title given to the ruler of the Kingdom of Italy after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The first to take the title was Odoacer, a \\"barbarian\\" military leader, in the late 5th century, followed by the Ostrogothic kings up to the mid-6th century. With the Frankish conquest of Italy in the 8th century, the Carolingians assumed the title, which was maintained by subsequent Holy Roman Emperors throughout the Middle Ages. The last Emperor to claim the title was Charles V in the 16th century. During this period, the holders of the title were crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.  - Aachen or Bad Aachen, traditionally known in English and French as Aix-la-Chapelle , is a spa and border city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Aachen was the preferred residence of Charlemagne, and, from 936 to 1531, the place where 31 Holy Roman Emperors were crowned Kings of the Germans.  - The Holy Roman Emperor (historically \\"\\" \\"Emperor of the Romans\\") was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect (\\"imperator electus\\") was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.

The Decadent Dessert: No grand feast would be complete without an indulgent finale. For dessert, guests delved into a sinfully sweet creation that showcased the best of British confections. A rich and velvety dark chocolate torte was the star of the plate, accompanied by a delicate dollop of Cornish clotted cream and a spoonful of fragrant Scottish raspberry coulis. On the side, a crumbly, buttery shortbread biscuit added just the right amount of crunch to balance out the other flavours. As the final bites were savoured, the appreciative murmurs of satisfied diners filled the banquet hall. Conclusion: Culinary events such as this grand feast demonstrate not only the power of food to bring people together but also the immense potential of fusion cuisine. By weaving together ingredients and techniques from different cultures, chefs and organizers created an unforgettable dining experience that celebrated both regional UK ingredients and the contemporary aspirations of global gastronomy. Leaving their mark on the 4,000 guests who dined together that evening, this sumptuous three-course menu proved to be the epitome of culinary elegance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away. Elmo said, \\"Yeah. So, beginning Monday there will be two doctors in the office. That should take a little pressure off. If I need to be out for a day or two, Dr. Edwards can fill in for me.\\" \\"Yeah, or if you need to take off a week for a trip to Hawaii with your beautiful new wife.\\" Carsie gave him a sexy smile. \\"That's right. Dr. Ernie will take care of everything while I'm gone.\\" \\"Dr. Ernie?\\" \\"Yeah. I asked if he would mind being called 'Dr. Ernie'.

Divide the stem into several 3- to 4-inch sections, making sure each segment has a dormant bud. 2. Line a shallow tray with sphagnum moss, and mist the moss until it is thoroughly damp. Plant the cuttings in the moss. Explanation: To propagate an orchid, you need to cut a stem and divide it into sections with dormant buds, then plant them in damp moss. The first option suggests laying the cuttings on the moss, which is wrong because they won't grow roots that way. The second option, planting the cuttings in the moss, is the correct way to propagate an orchid because it allows the segments to grow roots and become new plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"Everyone thinks so.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"Everyone thinks so,\\" we can infer that this statement implies that every individual within a particular group or context agrees on a certain matter, opinion, or idea. It means that there is a consensus, and the unanimous perception is that the stated opinion is true or valid. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" suggests the opposite. This statement implies that not a single person within that same group or context agrees with the opinion or idea being discussed. In this case, there is no consensus; instead, there is likely disagreement or alternative viewpoints in place. Analyzing both statements for logical consistency, it is clear that the premise \\"Everyone thinks so\\" and the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" are contradictory. Both expressions cannot be true in the same context since one claims a unanimous agreement, while the other suggests a lack of agreement or support from any individual. Therefore, based on the premise \\"Everyone thinks so,\\" the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" is not true. In order for both statements to coexist in a logical, consistent scenario, there must be a different context or variable involved that would allow for different opinions. For example, it might be possible that \\"Everyone thinks so\\" in Group A, while \\"Nobody thinks so\\" in Group B. However, in a single context, the two statements cannot both be accurate. It is essential to identify the specific context in which these statements are made and verify whether the information provided by the individuals is reliable. Understanding the background information, the reasons for agreeing or disagreeing, and the broader context in which these statements are made will help to determine the truthfulness of each respective claim. In summary, based on the premise \\"Everyone thinks so,\\" the hypothesis \\"Nobody thinks so\\" is not true if both statements refer to the same context or group, as they are logically inconsistent and contradictory with each other. However, if they refer to different contexts, it is possible for both to be accurate, but a deeper understanding of each context and the individuals involved is necessary to confirm their validity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mr Piech dismissed suggestions that VWs actions in hiring away Mr Lopez and his seven colleagues from GM had caused widespread dismay in German industry, and was at odds with the style of German business. Can we infer the following? Piech got nationalistic in his accusations.","output":"Based on the information provided, we cannot directly infer that Mr Piech got nationalistic in his accusations when he dismissed suggestions that Volkswagen's (VW) actions in hiring away Mr Lopez and his seven colleagues from General Motors (GM) had caused widespread dismay in German industry and was at odds with the style of German business. However, we can analyze this situation further to understand the context and background of Mr Piech's response. The hiring of Mr Lopez and his colleagues from GM by VW indicates that VW may have engaged in aggressive recruitment practices. This could have sparked suggestions that VW's behavior might not have been aligned with the typical style of German business, which is known for its conservatism, strong relationships, and long-term commitment. In dismissing these suggestions, Mr Piech appears to be defending VW's decisions and strategies, as well as emphasizing the company's independence and competitiveness. He might also be reiterating that business decisions should be based on the pursuit of corporate objectives and showing loyalty to VW employees, rather than adhering to alleged unwritten rules or maintaining the traditional decorum of German business. Although the provided information does not explicitly mention Mr Piech making nationalistic accusations, his defense of VW's actions might suggest that he is more focused on the company's global competitiveness and the potential benefits that hiring the former GM employees could bring. He could be trying to shift the focus away from any potential nationalistic sentiments or concerns about German industry as a whole, and focus more on the individual success and strategies of VW as an organization. In conclusion, while we cannot unequivocally infer that Mr Piech got nationalistic in his accusations, his dismissal of these suggestions does indicate that he is prioritizing VW's particular interests and success over any perceived obligations or traditions within the larger scope of German business."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Asoka is a child when his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, decides to renounce the throne to become a Jainist monk. Before his departure, Asoka's grandfather finds out that Asoka stole his sword and he confronts him. Chandragupta tells Asoka that his sword is cursed to taste blood whenever it is drawn, and he throws it into a creek. After he leaves, Asoka finds the sword and keeps it.

Israel does not have a constitution, but the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: \\"The State of Israel (...) will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.\\" Israeli law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages, and provides for class action suits; nonetheless, there are complaints of significant wage disparities between men and women. In 2012, Israel ranked eleventh out of 59 developed nations for participation of women in the workplace. Context: Even before the state of Israel was created, there were women fighting for women's rights in the land that became the state of Israel, for example women in the New Yishuv. Yishuv is the term referring to the body of Jewish residents in Palestine before the establishment of the state of Israel, and New Yishuv refers to those who began building homes outside the Old City walls of Jerusalem in the 1860s. In 1919 the first nationwide women's party in the New Yishuv (the Union of Hebrew Women for Equal Rights in Eretz Israel) was created, and Rosa Welt-Straus, who had immigrated there that year, was appointed its leader, as which she continued until her death. In 1926 the haredim, who preferred not to face the possibility of a plebiscite, left the yishuv's Assembly of Representatives, and that year an official declaration was made (ratified by the mandate government in 1927) confirming \\"equal rights to women in all aspects of life in the yishuv - civil, political, and economic.\\"  Israel was the third country in the world to be led by a female prime minister, Golda Meir, and in 2010, women's parliamentary representation in Israel was 18 percent, which is above the Arab world's average of 6 percent and equals that of the U.S. Congress. Still, it trails far behind the Scandinavian countries' 40 percent average  The Israeli parliament, The Knesset, has established \\"The Committee on the Status of Women,\\" to address women's rights. The stated objectives of this committee are to prevent discrimination, combat violence against women, and promote equality in politics, lifecycle events and education. In 1998, the Knesset passed a law for \\"Prevention of Sexual Harassment\\".  In 2013, the Minister of Religious Affairs and Chief Rabbis issued statements telling ritual bath attendants only to inspect women who want inspection, putting an end to forced inspections of women at mikvehs.

For that, he chose two objects, both made of the same element - object A and object B. Object A has a larger surface area, but object B has smaller surface area. He let these objects to react with other reactants to see how the processes work.  Which object would be more exposed to the reactants, object A or object B?  Hint: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air. However, the nails have a greater surface area, so they will rust faster. A:","output":"Based on the given hint and the example of the hammer and nails, object A, with a larger surface area, would be more exposed to the reactants compared to object B, which has a smaller surface area.  When solid substances, such as object A and object B, are involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. Consequently, the solid with a larger surface area has more of its matter exposed and is able to react with more reactants, leading to an increased reaction rate. In the example of the hammer and nails, both are made of iron and will rust when exposed to oxygen in the air. However, since the nails have a greater surface area, more of their matter is exposed to oxygen, causing them to rust faster than the hammer. Applying this same concept to John's experiment, object A would be more exposed to the reactants due to its larger surface area. As a result, we can deduce that object A will experience higher reaction rates compared to object B. In summary, the shape of an object, specifically its surface area, significantly affects how it reacts with other elements and influences the overall reaction rate."},{"instruction":"Dialogue:  M: I had my watch repaired in a watch shop, last night.

What is the answer?","output":"The autobiography entitled 'Spend, Spend, Spend' was written by Vivian Nicholson. Vivian Nicholson became a media sensation in the 1960s after she and her husband, Keith, won a massive £152,319 in the football pools in 1961 - a fortune at that time, equivalent to millions today.  Born in Castleford, West Yorkshire, England, Vivian grew up in impoverished conditions and worked as a textile worker. After the big win, Vivian was known for her flamboyant lifestyle and extravagant spending on luxury items such as clothes, cars, and holidays. When a newspaper reporter asked her what she planned to do with the money, she famously replied, \\"Spend, spend, spend!\\" and this phrase became her catchphrase in public’s eye. Her autobiography, 'Spend, Spend, Spend', was published in 1978. The book detailed the story of her life, from her impoverished childhood to winning the football pools, and subsequently losing it all. Vivian's fortunes took a turn for the worse after the tragic death of her husband Keith in a car crash in 1965. Gradually, the money ran out as she went through a series of failed relationships and businesses, eventually returning to a life of relative obscurity.

What confuses a person most is which travel destination to choose. When choosing a destination for a vacation or a trip, you need to decide what that destination has to offer to you. Meanwhile, you should also take many factors into consideration, so that the decision-making will get easy. The amount of money you want to spend is an important factor and plays an important role in deciding a destination. For example, cities like London, New York, Vegas etc are expensive. On the other hand when you travel to Asia, the cost is generally lower and you don't need to spend much on traveling, lodging or shopping. Therefore, it is important to estimate your budget before selecting a destination. When you plan your vacation, another important thing to plan is the number of the days you want to spend. There are many travel destinations in the world that can be covered in a week's time. Some destinations like Africa, or Maldives beaches can be planned in a week's time. Some other destinations like New York, Thailand may require more than a few weeks to enjoy completely. Vacations are also planned according to the company you have. For example, if you travel with your family, then you'll need a place where you can enjoy with your family members.

The inner lining of these networks is formed by a single layer of endothelial cells, which is specialized according to the needs of the tissue that it supplies. Whereas the general mechanisms of blood and lymphatic vessel development are being defined with increasing molecular precision, studies of the processes of endothelial specialization remain mostly descriptive. Recent insights from genetic animal models illuminate how endothelial cells interact with each other and with their tissue environment, providing paradigms for vessel type- and organ-specific endothelial differentiation. Delineating these governing principles will be crucial for understanding how tissues develop and maintain, and how their function becomes abnormal in disease.

He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965.

To draft the review, I will describe the app's functionality, highlight both its positive and negative features and include suggestions for improvement. Here is the completed review: Title: Decent Email Client with Room for Improvement I've been using the app with package com.fsck.k9 for a while now, and while it does provide a functional email client for Android devices, it still has a few notable issues that could use improvement. As a 3-star review, it means that I've had both a positive and negative experience with this app, but I see potential for growth. Firstly, I like how easy the app was to set up; adding my email accounts was a breeze, and the customization options allowed me to adjust the interface to fit my preferences. The app also supports multiple email accounts and different email protocols (IMAP, POP3, and Exchange), which considerably adds to its versatility. However, there were a few factors that prevented me from rating the app more highly. The performance can feel sluggish at times, with occasional delays in loading my inbox, and crashes have been reported by other users. Additionally, the user interface isn’t the most visually appealing or modern, which might deter some potential adopters. In terms of improvements, I believe that the developers could enhance the overall user experience by addressing the performance issues and modernizing the app's design. Furthermore, adding features like a built-in calendar and better integration with cloud services would set it apart from similar email clients and earn a higher rating. Overall, the com.fsck.k9 app is a decent email client, but it could use some refinement in its design, performance, and additional features. For users who value function over form and are willing to tolerate some occasional hiccups, it serves as a reliable tool for managing emails.

She has finished hanging streamers and now she has to fill the balloons. Having never used a helium tank before, she wants to test how much to fill each balloon.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   If one balloon is full and another is only half full does the full balloon have a higher or lower pressure? The answer to this question is:","output":"The full balloon would have a higher pressure. To explain this further, we first need to understand the basic principles of gases, which are explained by the ideal gas law. The law, in simple terms, states that the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature and volume, and inversely proportional to the amount of gas molecules. This theory was developed by a number of scientists over the 17th and 18th centuries and it works well for real gases under ordinary conditions, but it can become inaccurate under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure. Pressure, in the context of balloons, refers to the force exerted on the surface of the balloon because of the gas inside. Generally, when you fill a balloon with more gas (in this case, helium), it gets bigger - the volume of gas increases. As volume increases, however, the gas molecules inside the balloon have more space to move around. Despite the larger space, if you keep injecting more gas, the number of gas molecules will increase and they will collide with the balloon's walls more often, and with more force. These collisions of the gas molecules with the walls of the balloon create pressure. So if there are two balloons, and one (Balloon A) is completely filled with helium gas while the other (Balloon B) is only half full, this means that there are more helium gas molecules inside Balloon A than inside Balloon B. Thus, there should be more pressure inside Balloon A because there are more gas molecules colliding with its internal walls. Additionally, the walls of Balloon A are stretched more, meaning they're pulling inwards with more force. This additional inward force also contributes to a higher internal pressure. Therefore, in this context, the full balloon (Balloon A) will have a higher pressure compared to the half-full balloon (Balloon B). Balloon A, being fully filled, will have more helium gas which translates to more gas molecules that are colliding with the interior walls producing pressure. This makes Balloon A under higher pressure. It's important to note, however, that Balloon A is also more prone to popping due to the increased pressure and strain placed on the material of the balloon.  Lastly, it's worth mentioning that if the balloon is overfilled, it can burst due to the excessive pressure. So it is always advised to inflate the balloon with helium cautiously and not beyond its capacity. Given that Catherine has never used a helium tank before, she should make sure to fill the balloons slowly to avoid any accidents.  In conclusion, a fully inflated balloon has higher pressure compared to a half-full one. However, care should be taken not to overinflate the balloon, as it may lead to the balloon popping due to excessive pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth.

Explanation: A pain letter is a special letter that you write to a hiring manager to show your skills and how you can solve problems in their company.  A) is wrong because a pain letter is not just for helping workers understand the process of applying to higher pay positions, and it doesn't focus on building networks. It's to show the hiring manager how good you are at solving problems. B) is wrong because there's no need to write and send pain letters daily, bi-weekly, or monthly. You send a pain letter when you find a job you want to apply for, and each letter focuses on a specific job. D) is wrong because a pain letter is not about asking your supervisor or superiors about what is needed for a job. It's for you to show your skills to the hiring manager of a job you want to apply for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In terms of impact on events, it was more than Napoleon's personality that took effect. He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for great wars.

At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806, King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he mistakenly was told that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout.

Can we draw the following conclusion? The war caused much destruction. pick from the following.  -Yes  -It's impossible to say  -No","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the Six-Day War caused much destruction. This war resulted in significant territorial, political, and human consequences, as well as affecting the balance of power in the region. During the Six-Day War (June 5-10, 1967), Israel fought against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, which ultimately led to Israel occupying territories from all three countries. Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. This territorial expansion was significant and caused international disputes that still resonate today. In terms of destruction, the war had dire consequences for both the military and civilian populations on all sides. Various sources estimate that around 20,000 soldiers and civilians lost their lives, and many others sustained injuries. Large-scale displacements also took place, particularly affecting the Palestinian population, who fled or were expelled from their homes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This displacement created a long-lasting refugee crisis that persists to this day. Property and infrastructure were severely damaged in the war, particularly in the newly occupied areas. Towns and villages were destroyed or heavily damaged, as were roads, bridges, and other vital infrastructure. This destruction had substantial economic implications, particularly for the affected Arab countries, as they embarked on the process of rebuilding their nations. Apart from the immediate destruction, the Six-Day War had long-term ramifications for the region. The conflict intensified the Israeli-Arab disputes, solidified the Palestinian national identity, and created lasting political tensions that continue to impact regional stability. Furthermore, the rapid victory of the Israeli forces in the war greatly affected the balance of power in the Middle East, which yielded international diplomatic, military, and strategic consequences. In conclusion, we can assert that the Six-Day War caused much destruction, both in terms of the immediate impact on lives, property, and infrastructure, as well as the longer-term legacy of political and social issues that remain unresolved to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost 158.

After he forgets his daughter Diane's birthday, he attempts to make it up to her by promising her she can have his car when he secures the deal at work on the coming Thursday. After being persuaded to give the car to his daughter early, Elliot must hail a taxi from work, which is driven by Satanist Curtis Burch, who drives erratically and is of control. Attempting to get the taxi stopped, Elliot announces that he is Satan and commands him to stop the taxi, and also attempts to give him his wallet. Shocked to see his \\"Evil Master\\", Burch drives off a bridge and into the river. Elliot emerges from the accident scene, only to learn that he is a ghost when a police officer fails to notice him and a speeding bus goes straight through him. When he gets home he discovers that his three children can see him, but only in a totally dark room, and they can't hear him at times. He struggles to tell them what happened when he is whisked away to London by paranormal researcher Sir Edith, who tells him he is a ghost who has yet to enter the afterlife because \\"they screwed up\\"; his soul will not cross over until Thursday. The pressures of work and family life lead to many comedic events, as Elliot attempts to renew his life insurance policy and complete his company's merger, so his family will be provided for once he crosses over. One day, he must choose between staying in an important work meeting and helping his son with a magic trick at school. He eventually decides that his family's happiness is more important and walks out on his furious boss, Mr. Collins, who later smugly fires him. Dejected, Elliot reveals himself as a ghost to his love interest, Joan, whose initial shock soon turns to sympathy., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"Who is Joan's love interest?\\" would be Elliot Hopper. In the article, it is mentioned that \\"Elliot reveals himself as a ghost to his love interest, Joan, whose initial shock soon turns to sympathy.\\" This indicates that Elliot has a romantic connection with Joan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will remember the name of Garibaldi, the Italian patriot, who with Mazzini had been stirring up trouble for the Austrians. They finally pursued him so closely that he had to leave Italy. He came to America and set up a fruit store in New York City, where there were quite a number of his countrymen. By 1854, he had made a great deal of money in the fruit business, but had not forgotten his beloved country, and was anxious to be rich only in order that he might free Italy from the Austrians. He sold out his business in New York, and taking all his money, sailed for Italy. When the war of 1859 broke out, he volunteered, and fought throughout the campaign. But the compromising terms of peace galled him, and he was not satisfied with a country only half free. In the region around Genoa, he enrolled a thousand men to go on what looked like a desperate enterprise. Garibaldi had talked with Cavour, and between them, they had schemed to overthrow the kingdom of the Two Sicilies and join this land to the northern country. Of course, Cavour pretended not to know anything about Garibaldi, for the king of Naples and Sicily was supposed to be a friend of the king of Sardinia. Nevertheless, he secretly gave Garibaldi all the help that he dared, and urged men to enroll with him.

This, of course, should only be done when there is no harm that can come to your child or anyone else. For example, if your child is in the habit of throwing their juice when in their high chair, let them throw the cup.  Before handing them the cup, remind them of the rule and the consequences: \\"Remember, if you throw your cup, your juice will spill and you won't have any juice to drink.\\" A mess on the floor might be annoying for you, but there's a good chance you'll need to clean the floor after a 2 year old's meal anyway. After they throw their cup on the floor, the 2 year old will undoubtedly ask for their juice. Point out that since they threw the juice, there is no more juice for them. For example: “I'm sorry, Kate, but your cup is empty now because you threw it on the floor. You don't have any more juice.” You might need to explain the consequence more than once, until your toddler makes the connection between throwing the juice and not being able to have it. If they cry out “But I want my juice!” calmly reply that “When you throw your cup and spill your juice, there is no more juice to drink.” Even if they throw a tantrum, hold firm and remain calm. Ignore them (without leaving the room) until they've calmed down, and don't relent and give them more juice. The next time the 2 year old is in a high chair, remind them not to throw their cup, or else there will be no more juice for them. It may take a few tries, but they'll eventually make the connection. For instance, once you hand them the juice cup, say “Now Jordan, remember that if you throw your juice cup, you won't have any more juice to drink.” Summary:","output":"The idea here is teaching your little one about actions and consequences. If they do something, like throw their juice cup, something else will happen, like them not having juice to drink. Once they throw their cup and have no more juice, they should slowly start to understand that if they don't want their juice to spill, they shouldn't throw their cup. It may take some time and patience, but it's an important lesson for them to learn. The key is to remind them of the rule and consequence before they do the action, and then not to give more juice once they've spilled it. Kind of like how if you run with scissors and accidentally make a mess, you have to clean it up."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3 km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: \\"We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land.\\" The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp. Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.  answer the following question:  What was the name of the person who Chafe concluded their party had not reached the island?

Question: This article: Following the release of With Teeth in 2005, the live band was reassembled for the Live: With Teeth tour.  Since the previous tour five years earlier, much of the band had moved on in their careers, and only drummer Jerome Dillon rejoined. To find replacements, Reznor held auditions during December 2004.  He stated that keyboardist Alessandro Cortini \\"fit in immediately\\", though he had trouble finding a guitarist to replace Robin Finck until auditioning Aaron North. The tour began with a series of small-club performances early in 2005. The band told journalists they were \\"pleasantly surprised by the interest\\" of fans despite their lengthy absence.  This initial leg of the tour also included a headlining performance at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.  The band followed with a North American arena tour in autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Death From Above 1979, Autolux, and Saul Williams. Williams performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the Voodoo Music Experience festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor's former home. To conclude the With Teeth era of the band, Nine Inch Nails completed a tour of North American amphitheaters in the summer of 2006, joined by Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. The 2007 release Beside You in Time features performances from the North American arena tour, the North American amphitheater tour, and a number of studio rehearsals.Nine Inch Nails were scheduled to perform at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, but dropped themselves from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of George W. Bush as a backdrop to the band's performance of \\"The Hand that Feeds\\". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on the official Nine Inch Nails website: \\"apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me\\".  MTV replied by saying they respected Reznor's point of view, but were \\"uncomfortable\\" with the performance being \\"built around partisan political statements\\".

Jacarandas thrive with sun, and should be planted in an area that will receive frequent, direct sunlight for most of the year. Plant the tree at least 15-feet (4.5 meters) away from any nearby buildings, and do not plant seedlings in the shade of other, larger trees. Jacaranda trees will suffer if their roots don’t drain well, and they need fertile, rich soil to provide them with nutrients. If you’re planting your tree in a large planter or pot, place the jacaranda in a rich soil mixture. A local nursery or Garden center should have a variety of soil bags for sale, and sales staff can help you select a healthy mixture for your jacaranda. If you plant the tree directly into the ground, you’ll have less control over the makeup of the soil than if you were buying it from a plant nursery. Look for a patch of soil that isn’t prone to having puddles and has other plants already growing in it. Jacarandas need frequent watering in order to grow and thrive in temperate climates. Healthy jacaranda trees grow quickly, but will wilt and possibly die if given insufficient water. Between March and October, use a household hose to water the jacaranda tree about once a week. During the cooler winter months, you do not need to water the tree as regularly. The jacaranda will not be growing during November through February, and so you should only water the tree about once a month. Although they begin small as seedlings, jacarandas can grow into massive trees. Jacarandas commonly reach between 25-50 feet (7.6-15 meters) in height and can have a width of 15-30 feet (4.5-9 meters). Plant the jacaranda in a large, open area where it will have room to grow to its full size. For example, jacarandas do well in large front or back yards.  If you plant the jacaranda in an already cramped or crowded space (e.g. under a patio roof or between narrow walls) it will not grow to its full size and may wither and become unhealthy. Plant the tree at least 15-feet (4.5 meters) away from homes and other structures so that falling branches are less likely to cause damage.","output":"To grow a jacaranda tree, plant it in a sunny area with good drainage, give it plenty of space, water it regularly, and use rich soil."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Grateful: Addison might feel grateful that Alex is helping her maintain her financial balance. Having someone to assist and watch over her financial habits can be reassuring since she doesn't have to face these challenges alone. 2. Relieved: As Addison struggles with managing her finances, having Alex's help can be calming and stress-relieving. It takes some of the pressure off her shoulders because she knows that there will be support to ensure her financial stability. 3. Insecure: The fact that Addison is not good with money and needs Alex to maintain her balance may also lead her to feel insecure about her financial skills. These feelings of inadequacy can create self-doubt and a sense of dependency on Alex. 4. Motivated: Alex's help could also inspire Addison to strive for improvement in her financial management skills. This recognition of her shortcomings might be the catalyst for growth and the development of better habits for maintaining her own financial stability. 5. Guilty: Addison could feel a sense of guilt for relying on Alex to handle her financial responsibilities. She might perceive it as placing an unnecessary burden on her friend. In conclusion, \\"dutiful\\" isn't a valid answer to describe Addison's feelings as a result of Alex keeping her financial balance. Instead, other emotions such as gratitude, relief, insecurity, motivation, or guilt might more accurately capture her feelings in this situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use a small luncheonsize plate and avoid the large ones that may encourage you to \\"load up\\".You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist. Once you have had your \\"tasting\\" serving,move away from the dining room. Doing so will make it easy to stop yourself eating constantly at the sight of food.

Meanwhile, the local state insane asylum has sent a majority of the hospital's inmates to the carnival for therapy, but three psychotic mental patients break away from the group and kill three clowns, taking their makeup and costumes. While at the circus, Casey innocently visits a fortune teller despite Randy's better judgment. The fortune teller reveals to Casey that his life line has been cut short, and says to him: \\"Beware, beware, in the darkest of dark /though the flesh is young and the hearts are strong /precious life cannot be long /when darkest death has left its mark.\\" As the boys return from the circus, a shaken Casey thinks his nightmare is over, but it has only just begun. When the clowns target their home, Casey is forced to face his fears once and for all. Casey and his brothers are locked inside their isolated farmhouse and the power is turned off. Casey attempts to call the police, but because Casey says that the \\"clowns from the circus are trying to get him\\", the police officers assume that Casey's fear of clowns caused him to have a realistic nightmare.

The question asks about a scenario in which a person's death is unwanted by them. The options provided include cyanide, love, burial, suicide, and murder. Step 2: Analyze each option in regard to the main question. - Cyanide: A poisonous substance often used to cause death. If someone consumes cyanide (intentionally or accidentally) and dies, it may be unwanted by the person who has died. - Love: In this context, love does not directly result in an unwanted death, as it is an emotional feeling rather than an action. - Burial: Although a necessary process following a person's death, a burial itself is not the cause of the unwanted death. - Suicide: In the case of suicide, an individual intentionally causes their own death. Hence, the death in this case was wanted, at least at the moment of taking the action, by the person who died. - Murder: This option entails the unlawful killing of another person. As it is an act committed by someone else, the victim's death is often unwanted by the person who has died. Step 3: Select the best answer based on the analysis of each option. In the context of the main question, the best answer would be murder. This is because it involves the unlawful and intentional killing of someone by another person, which is most likely an unwanted scenario for the person facing death."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In these two sentences (1) A slight move of the tiller, and the boat will go off course. (2) His move put him directly in my path., does the word move mean the same thing?","output":"In these two sentences, the word \\"move\\" is used with a similar underlying concept but with slight differences in meaning and context. In both sentences, \\"move\\" denotes some form of motion or change in position, but the application of the word varies based on the specific context within each sentence. 1. A slight move of the tiller, and the boat will go off course. In this first sentence, \\"move\\" refers to the physical action of altering the position of the tiller, which is a lever used to control the direction of a boat. This context emphasizes the precise adjustment that causes a change in the boat's course. Here, 'move' suggests a deliberate and controlled action that directly influences the boat's navigation. The focus is on the small, subtle shift that has a significant impact on the boat's direction. 2. His move put him directly in my path. In the second sentence, \\"move\\" is used to describe the way someone changed their position, resulting in them being directly in the speaker's path. The motion might be voluntary or involuntary, and could involve walking, running, or any other means of changing location. In this case, 'move' implies a broader, less-defined action that led to that person's presence in the speaker's way. The focus here is on the result (being in someone's path) rather than the specifics of the motion itself. While \\"move\\" in both sentences pertains to an alteration or change in position, the first sentence emphasizes a precise, controlled action with direct consequences on the boat's course, while the second sentence addresses a broader sense of motion, focusing more on the outcome rather than the details of the action itself. In summary, the word \\"move\\" doesn't mean exactly the same thing in both sentences, as it carries contextual differences based on the situations presented. However, the underlying concept of change or alteration in position is present in both cases, connecting the two seemingly different meanings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The corporation's current HQ in Llandaff will shut and staff will relocate to a new building in Central Square in 2018. BBC Cymru Wales director Rhodri Talfan Davies said the location was a chance to be closer to audiences. The ageing infrastructure of the current HQ is the reason for the move. The new 150,000 sq ft (13,936 sq m) building relies upon the wider Capital Square development around Cardiff Central train station to progress as planned. The Capital Square project, to be delivered by Rightacres Property, include proposals to relocate the bus station. As well housing the existing BBC staff and services based at Llandaff, S4C has announced in principle that it plans to share some broadcasting services with the BBC at the new centre. Mr Talfan Davies said the new broadcast centre promised to be \\"an exciting new home in a remarkable location right at the heart of the action\\". \\"The public rightly demand the best from the BBC - and this development will at last give our programming teams the tools, the technology and the facilities to serve our audiences for decades to come,\\" he said. BBC Cymru Wales announced in August 2013 that it wanted to leave Broadcasting House in Llandaff. Broadcasting House, and the BBC's Ty Oldfield opposite, have both been for sale since autumn 2013. It is understood that the sale of the land will be concluded in the coming months, and will help fund the new development. First Minister Carwyn Jones said the new building would provide a state-of-the-art headquarters on a par with those in Glasgow, Salford and London. \\"It is particularly important for the people of Wales, which requires public service broadcasting that properly represents their dynamic, devolved nation, with a thriving political democracy and creative content industry,\\" he said. Cardiff council leader Phil Bale, said the new building would fast-track its plans for the bus station area, which currently does not give the best impression of the city. \\"This type of investment comes around once in a generation. It boosts Cardiff's emergence as a leading centre for creative industries in Europe,\\" he said.

Does \\"The governments in Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg are designated by the term Senate.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"The parliament in Berlin is called what?\\"","output":"No, the given statement, \\"The governments in Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg are designated by the term Senate,\\" does not provide the correct answer to the question \\"The parliament in Berlin is called what?\\" The statement refers to the governments of three German city-states—Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg—and mentions that they are known as Senates. It does not, however, specifically address the parliament in Berlin.  To answer the question, \\"The parliament in Berlin is called what?\\" we need to focus on the legislative branch of Berlin, which is specifically responsible for creating and modifying laws. In Berlin, the city-state's parliament is referred to as the \\"Abgeordnetenhaus,\\" sometimes translated as the House of Representatives or the House of Deputies in English. The Abgeordnetenhaus is a unicameral legislative body, meaning it only has one chamber, and it is composed of elected representatives from various political parties. The Abgeordnetenhaus has several functions, including: 1. Passing and amending laws: The parliament is responsible for creating and modifying the legal framework in Berlin, taking into consideration the interests and needs of its constituents. 2. Representation and deliberation: The elected representatives in the Abgeordnetenhaus ensure that diverse perspectives and political interests are represented in the decision-making process. 3. Oversight: The Abgeordnetenhaus holds the executive branch, the Senate, accountable for its actions. By questioning and scrutinizing the executive branch's decisions, the parliament maintains a system of checks and balances. 4. Budget approval: The parliament discusses and approves the annual budget, which outlines the funding for different policy areas and public services. In conclusion, although the statement touches upon the governments of Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg being designated as Senates, it does not provide the correct answer to the question of what the parliament in Berlin is called. Instead, the correct answer is \\"Abgeordnetenhaus,\\" a legislative body responsible for various functions, including law-making, representation, oversight, and budget approval."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

PUBLISHED:. 04:32 EST, 18 February 2014. |. UPDATED:. 20:01 EST, 18 February 2014. Dangling from a wooden frame, a live but unconscious pig is shot by a soldier to inflict terrible wounds. The stricken animal, still breathing, is then untied so military medics can operate on it and learn how to treat traumatic battlefield injuries. The shocking photos – never seen before – were taken in Denmark during a series of experiments which are attended by surgeons serving in Britain’s Armed Forces. Scroll down for video. Military surgeons who serve in the British Forces are taking part in controversial medical training in which live pigs are shot and wounded by marksmen so that medics can practise battlefield surgery. The animals are first strung up. The medical professionals are sent to Denmark to operate on the live animal - which has been strung up and shot by trained marksmen - while it is still breathing. The animals are taken by stretcher into operating theatres where the surgeons treat their wounds in a simulation of how injured soldiers are cared for. The Ministry of Defence has admitted. that live pigs are also blown up by explosives at the Definitive. Surgical and Trauma Care course held at Nato’s Jaegerspris Kaserne. training area, 30 miles from Copenhagen. Military. chiefs have defended the exercises, saying they had ‘saved many lives’ in Afghanistan and Iraq. The courses have led to huge improvements in. the treatment of soldiers injured by bullets and roadside bombs. But animal welfare activists have demanded an end to the ‘brutal’ practice. Pigs are then treated the same as a human casualty would be -  with medics rushing to their side and using dressings to stem blood loss. They are then taken to the waiting teams of surgeons. It is believed that even if the operation is a success, the animals are later destroyed. The. photographs of pigs being shot with an AK-47 assault rifle or a 9mm. handgun were obtained by campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment. of Animals UK (PETA UK). They. were published as Denmark was at the centre of another animal cruelty. row, after the controversial killing of a healthy giraffe at Copenhagen. Zoo. Mimi Bekhechi, PETA UK. associate director, said it was ‘shameful’ the British military were. taking part in the twice-yearly training courses that are nicknamed. Operation Danish Bacon.She said: ‘The exercises are impossible to. justify medically, ethically or educationally.’ Campaigners. claim that hi-tech human simulators – such as the state-of-the-art. Caesar simulator, which ‘breathes and bleeds’ – should be used instead. of animals. During the. Danish experiments, sedatives are first mixed into the pigs’ food. When. they fall asleep they are anaesthetised by a vet. The Definitive Surgical and Trauma Care course (DSTC) took place at Nato's Jaegerspris training area 30 miles north-west of the Danish capital Copenhagen. Pigs are used in the exercise so surgeons can learn how to treat battle wounds, because they are genetically very close to humans. Camp Bastion hospital, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. The MoD has. defended sending medical staff for the  animal training,. saying simulators are used where possible to train for real-life situations as above. The. animals – from a breed which has similar skin to humans – are then. taken to a shooting range, where marksmen try to ensure that their shots. injure but do not kill. The. pigs are then placed on a stretcher – just as a human casualty would be. – while medics use dressings to stem blood loss before a waiting team. of surgeons operates. Even if the operation is a success, the animals. are later destroyed. The. use of animals in military experiments in the UK is not illegal, but to. carry out similar training approval would need to be obtained from the. Home Office on a case-by-case basis. An. MoD spokesman said: ‘The research we undertake saves lives by helping. us develop world-class protective equipment and new medical treatments. that benefit both troops and civilians. ‘Advances. in technology mean we are reducing the number of procedures carried out. on pigs but there is some research, such as countering the threat posed. by chemical and biological weapons, that can not be conducted without. the use of animals.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article describes how military surgeons from the British Armed Forces participate in controversial medical training in Denmark, which involves live pigs being shot and wounded by marksmen so that medics can practice battlefield surgery.

Ulaştırma bakanlığının verilerine göre, geçtiğimiz yıl yolcu sayısı 2003 yılına göre yüzde 13 artış gösterirken sefer sayısında yüzde 18'lik bir artış kaydedildi. Translate to English","output":"According to the data from the Ministry of Transport, the number of passengers increased by 13% last year compared to 2003, while the number of trips recorded an increase of 18%. Based on the information provided by the Ministry of Transport, it is evident that there has been a significant surge in transportation usage in recent years. The number of passengers utilizing various means of transportation rose by 13% last year, in comparison to the recorded figures from 2003. This increase can be attributed to several factors, such as population growth, economic development, and improvements in transport infrastructure. Moreover, the number of trips undertaken also experienced an 18% increase, suggesting that not only are more people using transport services, but they are also using them more frequently. This growth in transportation demand can place additional strain on existing infrastructure and may necessitate further investment to accommodate the increasing number of passengers and services. The improvement in transport infrastructure could be a result of substantial investment in public transportation, road networks, and railway systems by the government in recent times. As well-organized and efficient transportation networks are crucial for sustaining economic growth and ensuring a high quality of life for citizens, it is vital that the Ministry of Transport continues to monitor and analyze trends in passenger numbers and trip frequency to better anticipate future needs. Population growth also plays an essential role in the upswing in transportation usage. As the population increases, so does the demand for accessible and efficient transport systems. Urbanization may also contribute to such trends, as more people migrate to urban areas, where transportation options are more readily available, such as buses, trams, and subways. Furthermore, economic development can lead to a rise in disposable income among citizens, allowing them to afford more frequent trips. Such developments can result in increased demand for transportation, particularly in the private sector, with more people opting to purchase vehicles for personal use. In conclusion, the Ministry of Transport's data highlighting a 13% increase in passenger numbers and an 18% increase in trips compared to 2003 underscores the rapid growth in transportation demand in recent years. A combination of factors, including population growth, economic development, and investment in infrastructure, likely contributed to these trends. Regulations and further investments in transportation infrastructure will be necessary to respond to these changes effectively and to ensure sustainable growth in the sector."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So, saying that Europrop International GmbH is a joint venture between no more than 3 European aircraft engine manufacturers contradicts the previously stated information. Therefore, the best answer would be 'No'. Europrop International GmbH is a result of a collaboration of more than three companies. It constitutes a significant entity in the aerospace industry, known specifically for the production of the Europrop TP400-D6 7970 skW/10,690shp turboprop developed for the Airbus A400M Atlas. It is their sole product which signifies their niche specialization and expertise within the sector. Therefore, it's crucial to correctly represent the collaborative effort of the four above-mentioned companies. In conclusion, it is staunchly stated that Europrop International GmbH is not a joint venture between no more than three European aircraft engine manufacturers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: A blond woman leans against a white fence. Hypothesis: The woman is hispanic. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"From the premise provided, we cannot definitively conclude if the hypothesis is true. The information given in the premise: \\"A blond woman leans against a white fence\\" in no way provides explicit information about the woman's ethnic or racial background which includes being Hispanic. The character's hair color, blond, and the action of her leaning against a white fence, do not specifically indicate her ethnicity. Hispanic individuals can indeed have a variety of hair colors, including blond, due to genetic diversity and other factors like hair dye. However, hair color alone is not a reliable indicator of someone's ethnicity. Additionally, the premise doesn't provide information about the woman's physical characteristics such as facial features, skin complexion, or other specific details that might, to a certain degree, suggest a particular ethnic background. Even with such characteristics, it would still be an assumption rather than a definite determination since such attributes can occur in several ethnic backgrounds. To validate the hypothesis, we would need additional information or context about the woman’s heritage, language, culture, birthplace, or family history. While racial and ethnic identity can be complex and multifaceted, encompassing more than just physical appearance, usually such a designation is tied to some combination of geographic origin, culture, language, and patterns of family migration. Therefore, based on the premise, we cannot conclusively determine that the woman is Hispanic. Conclusively affirming the hypothesis based on this limited premise could lead to stereotyping or misrepresentation. To avoid this, it is important in practice to have adequate and reliable information when attributing identity markers like ethnicity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The colorful puzzle has gone on to become the world's biggest selling toy -- with 350 million sold. Hungarian-born Rubik retraces the moment of inspiration that led him to his iconic invention. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Ernő Rubik: The Mastermind Behind the World's Best-Selling Toy Introduction Ernő Rubik, a Hungarian professor and architect, is the mastermind behind the Rubik's Cube, the world's largest selling toy. Boasting sales of over 350 million, the Rubik's Cube has become a cultural icon and a beloved puzzle across generations worldwide. Born from humble beginnings as a teaching aid in his classroom, the cube has gone on to inspire countless marvel at the simplicity and complexity of its design. Here, we delve into the story of Rubik's moment of inspiration and how it led to the creation of one of the most universally recognized toys in history. The Beginning In the early 1970s, Ernő Rubik was teaching architecture and design at the Budapest College of Applied Arts. While trying to find a compelling method to convey geometry and spacial concepts to his students, Rubik sought to create a tangible and interactive model that would enable them to visualize how three-dimensional objects could move in relation to one another. Amidst his search for inspiration, Rubik stumbled upon the initial spark that would eventually become the Rubik's Cube. The Moment of Inspiration According to Ernő Rubik himself, the eureka moment that led to the invention of the Rubik's Cube was when he was attempting to design a structure with moving parts that could rotate without falling apart. He soon discovered that the solution lay in the use of a 'core' mechanism that allowed individual blocks to twist and rotate around a central axis without disassembling the overall structure. Armed with this breakthrough in design, Rubik created the prototype of what would become the Rubik's Cube - a cube composed of 27 smaller cubes, with 3x3 layers that could be individually manipulated along the X, Y, or Z axis. This early prototype was made using simple wooden blocks and rubber bands, in stark contrast to the colorful plastic models we recognize today. From Teaching Aid to Global Sensation Upon completion of the prototype, Rubik introduced the cube to his students as an interactive teaching aid for understanding complex geometry. However, it quickly became apparent that the cube had laid the foundation for a puzzle that demanded creativity and logical thinking to solve. Realizing the potential of his invention, Rubik applied for a patent in 1975 and soon entered the world of mass production. Initially known as the \\"Magic Cube\\", this latest addition to the toy market eventually emerged onto the global stage under the name \\"Rubik's Cube\\" in 1980. Consequently, the popularity of the cube exploded, reaching a staggering 100 million units sold within the first two years. A Lasting Legacy More than four decades after its inception, the Rubik's Cube continues to be an emblematic figure in popular culture. Its simple yet challenging design has encouraged millions of people worldwide to engage in problem-solving and creativity. The cube has also given rise to various related inventions such as the 4x4 Rubik's Revenge, the 5x5 Professor's Cube, and countless speedcubing competitions. In Conclusion Ernő Rubik's journey of discovery, from searching for a teaching aid in his classroom to inventing a globally celebrated symbol of intellectual curiosity, truly epitomizes the power of innovation and creativity. The Rubik's Cube, a vibrant and complex puzzle, is a testament to the human mind's pursuit of challenge and understanding. With continuous sales and a deeply entrenched presence in popular culture, the Rubik's Cube stands as an enduring icon that transcends generations and invites us all to experience the joy of solving the world's best-selling toy."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The Hawker Hunter jet crashed on the A27 in Sussex during the Shoreham Air Show on 22 August 2015. A further 13 people, including the pilot Andy Hill, were injured. In its final report on the disaster, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) listed a series of failings including poor risk assessments. Mr Hill, 52, from Hertfordshire, has been the subject of a manslaughter investigation by Sussex Police and was interviewed under caution. 'A fireball headed towards us at 400mph' Live updates: Shoreham air disaster report On publication of the report into the disaster, AAIB principal inspector Julian Firth said: \\"The aircraft crashed because at the top of its aerobatic manoeuvre it was too low to complete it.\\" The parents of victim Matthew Grimstone, 23, said: \\"Apart from anything that the pilot may have got wrong it is very evident the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Shoreham Air Show organisers have got much to answer for. \\"Rules laid down by the CAA were quite clearly inadequate and those that were there were, in some cases, not fully adhered to by the air show organisers.\\" Caroline Schilt, the mother of Jacob Schilt, who died along with fellow Worthing United player Mr Grimstone as they travelled in a car to a game, said she was happy with the AAIB's investigation, but there would still be unanswered questions until the inquests were held. \\"The AAIB has given us as a very comprehensive and factual report of their investigation... but there are still questions and they are ones for the coroner, and she is still waiting for all the inquiries to finish before she can go further.\\" A new date has now been set for the rescheduled pre-inquest review into the deaths. It will take place on 20 June at the West Sussex Coroner's Court, in Crawley, but no evidence will be heard. The organisers of the airshow said the report \\"clearly confirms that a series of errors by an experienced and fully authorised pilot were the cause of the tragic crash\\". The AAIB criticised risk assessments which did not adequately protect people in areas \\"outside the control of the organisers\\", but Shoreham chiefs claimed they had \\"always worked hard to ensure the event was both safe and successful\\". \\"Our main aim in 2015 was to do just that, but there are findings in the report that will require further analysis and reflection. \\"The report also contains important recommendations for the CAA, as well as the wider airshow industry, and these must be noted carefully,\\" they said. The report said the pilot carried out the manoeuvre at less than maximum thrust. It would have been possible to abort it safely at the apex of the loop but Mr Hill had not been trained in the escape manoeuvre which might have got him out of trouble. The AAIB also found the severity of the outcome of the crash was due to \\"an absence of provisions to mitigate the effects of an aircraft crashing in an area outside the control of the organisers of the flying display\\". The report said the risk assessment \\"was not suitable and sufficient to manage the risks to the public\\", and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) did not require to see or approve risk assessments before issuing a permission to hold a flying display. The AAIB made a total of 32 safety recommendations for the CAA. Ten are in the final report, including that airshow organisers must conduct suitable and sufficient risk assessments, and pilots must tell organisers what manoeuvres they will carry out and where. The AAIB also recommends that pilots should be trained in escape manoeuvres, and that displaying aircraft are separated from the public by a sufficient distance to minimise risk of injury to the public. It also recommends that the Department for Transport commission, and report the findings of, \\"an independent review of the governance of flying display activity to determine the form of governance that will achieve the level of safety it requires\\". Richard Westcott, transport correspondent Investigators interviewed the Shoreham pilot several times but critically, he can't remember anything about the accident. They say his flight helmet had dents in so it's possible he hit his head. What that means is that, although they know the aircraft was flying too low and too slow, and that the engine wasn't at full power when it should have been, they can only speculate as to why. One possible explanation they've looked at is whether the pilot got confused with another jet aircraft, called a Jet Provost, which he normally flies. The height and speed he started the Shoreham manoeuvre would be right for the Jet Provost, because it is smaller and lighter than the Hunter. Aviation specialists have suggested that he may have got the planes muddled up. But it's unlikely that we will ever know for sure. Sussex Police said it would be looking at the AAIB report in detail with its independent experts. Det Ch Insp Paul Rymarz said: \\"We have been waiting some time for this report and it will take us some time to review. \\"We hope to do everything we can to submit a file of material to the CPS in advance of the pre-inquest review on 20 June. \\"As we have said before, this is an extraordinarily complex investigation, but we remain committed to finding answers for the families and friends of those who died.\\" Both the AAIB and CAA have already published a series of interim reports looking at the findings from the crash scene and implications for air displays around the UK An AAIB report in September 2015 found the jet showed \\"no abnormal indications\\" during its flight. But a further report in December said the aircraft had expired ejector seat parts and an out-of-date technical manual. In March last year, the AAIB said organisers of the Shoreham air show were unaware of the pilot's display plans. Safety measures at all UK civil air shows were enhanced following the disaster and the CAA said it had reviewed every aspect of air display safety. The AAIB made 21 safety recommendations which were all accepted by the CAA this year. Who were the Shoreham air crash victims? What is a summary of this text?","output":"The Shoreham Air Show crash in 2015, which killed 11 people, was the result of the pilot flying too low and too slow during an aerobatic manoeuvre, according to a report from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). The report also criticized risk assessments which failed to adequately protect people outside the area directly controlled by the organizers and made a total of 32 safety recommendations for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

Washington Booms As a New Gilded Age Takes Root Introduction [Step 1: Introduce the topic of the article—Washington's economic boom and the new Gilded Age] As income inequality grows and the divide between the wealthy and the poor widens, it may seem difficult to spot the American cities that are experiencing economic booms. However, one such city stands out: Washington D.C., the nation's capital. Many are raising their eyebrows, wondering, \\"What sequester?\\" Amidst the federal budget cuts and the overall economic downturn, Washington has managed to rise above as a modern Gilded Age takes root in the city. A New Gilded Age [Step 2: Define the modern Gilded Age in terms of economic disparity and wealth accumulation] The term \\"Gilded Age\\" dates back to the late 19th century, a period in American history characterized by rapid economic growth and extreme income inequality. Coined by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner, the phrase signifies a thin layer of gold gilding over a less attractive core. In this case, the new Gilded Age is marked by a select few amassing immense wealth while the majority of the population remains economically stagnant or worse. Washington's Boom [Step 3: Explain the factors contributing to Washington's economic boom] The Washington D.C. area had its first economic surge during the 1990s with the rise of the information technology industry. Since then, numerous government contracts, lobbying firms, and federal jobs have continued to fuel the city's growth. It has also attracted a diverse and well-educated workforce, further augmenting its already lucrative economy. Effects on Surrounding Areas [Step 4: Examine how Washington's boom affects nearby communities] The impact of Washington's economic rise has spread to surrounding areas, most notably Northern Virginia and Maryland suburbs, where the population has swelled, and housing costs have skyrocketed. This side effect is particularly palpable in neighborhoods known for housing federal employees and contractors, showcasing the striking divide between the affluent and the struggling working class. A Divided Society [Step 5: Address the ethical and social implications of the new Gilded Age] While Washington's boom might seem like a cause for celebration for those reaping the benefits, it has also revealed a disturbing trend of economic inequality that extends far beyond D.C.'s borders. A divided society emerges with wealthy elites accumulating more wealth and influence, while countless American families face financial hardships. Conclusion [Step 6: Recap the main points and emphasize the need for addressing the issue] Washington D.C.'s economic boom and the emergence of the new Gilded Age might bring prosperity to a fortunate few, but it also underscores a concerning reality of wealth disparity both within the nation's capital and throughout the United States. As the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow, it is crucial for policymakers and citizens alike to address these issues, lest the modern Gilded Age becomes a permanent fixture in American society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

The percentage of households with access to the Internet more than doubled between 2006 and 2013, from 23% to 56% respectively (compared with an EU average of 49% and 79%). At the same time, there has been a massive increase in the proportion of households with a broadband connection, from 4% in 2006 to 55% in 2013 (compared with an EU average of 30% and 76%). However, Greece also has the EU's third highest percentage of people who have never used the Internet: 36% in 2013, down from 65% in 2006 (compared with an EU average of 21% and 42%).\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, in 2013, 56% of Greek households had access to the Internet at home. This is compared to the European Union (EU) average of 79% for that same year. It's important to note that Greece has seen significant growth in Internet access between 2006 and 2013, with the percentage of households with access more than doubling. Additionally, there has been a considerable increase in the number of households with broadband connections in Greece, rising from 4% in 2006 to 55% in 2013. This is fairly close to the EU average of 76% in 2013. However, it is worth mentioning that Greece had the EU's third-highest percentage of people who have never used the Internet, at 36% in 2013, decreasing from 65% in 2006. This is still higher than the EU average of 21% in 2013, down from 42% in 2006. To calculate the number of Europeans who could access the Internet from home in 2013, we would need to know the total population of Europe or the European Union and apply the 79% EU average to that number. Unfortunately, the provided information does not give the total population, so we cannot determine the exact number of Europeans with home Internet access in 2013. However, we can confidently state that 79% of European households, on average, had access to the web from their homes in 2013."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Let's analyze both sentences step-by-step to determine if they are paraphrases of each other. Sentence 1: Sunnis make up 77 percent of Pakistan's population, Shiites 20 percent. - It provides information about the percentage of Sunnis and Shiites in the context of Pakistan's population. - It implies that Sunnis comprise 77% of the entire population while Shiites make up 20%. Sentence 2: About 80 percent of Pakistan's 140 million people are Sunnis. - It provides information about the percentage of Sunnis in Pakistan's population, with a slight approximation (80%). - It gives a specific number for the total population of Pakistan (140 million). Now let's compare both sentences: - Sentence 1 mentions both Sunni and Shiite percentages, while Sentence 2 only mentions Sunnis. - Sentence 2 contains a slight approximation (80%) for the Sunni's percentage, different from Sentence 1 (77%). - Sentence 2 provides the total population of Pakistan, which is not present in Sentence 1.

Additionally, Christopher was the basketball team's star player, which greatly influenced his confidence in their ability to win. Step 1: Understand the characters and their feelings Samuel's lack of confidence stems from his realistic perspective and the consideration of potential negative outcomes. On the other hand, Christopher's high confidence stems from his inherent optimism and his role as the star player on the team. Step 2: Introduce a triggering event or situation The big game was just around the corner, and the team was set to face their toughest opponents yet, the Hawks. They were considered the best team in the league, having won the previous season's championship. Step 3: Develop characters' actions and reactions based on their feelings and the event As the game approached, Samuel's anxiety grew. He carefully analyzed the Hawks' previous games, noting their strengths and weaknesses, and was becoming increasingly concerned about his own team's chances. Even though he knew that Christopher's incredible skills could help, he couldn't shake off his doubts. Meanwhile, Christopher continued training, focused on improving his moves and strategies. He believed that the key to success was in maintaining a positive outlook, so he encouraged his teammates to do the same. Due to his vigorous training sessions and motivational speeches, the team's spirits were lifted. Step 4: Develop a plot twist or escalation of events On the day of the match, Samuel's fears seemed to come true when the Hawks opened with a strong lead. However, Christopher's unwavering determination to win spread throughout the team, and they managed to narrow the gap before the half-time whistle. During the break, Samuel nervously approached Christopher, voicing his concerns. Instead of dismissing Samuel's worries, Christopher acknowledged them and responded with reassurance, explaining that they would have to keep pushing themselves to the very end to have a chance at victory. Step 5: Reach a climax and resolve the story With Samuel and Christopher now united in their determination, the second half began. Their team fought hard, and, with only seconds left on the clock, Christopher scored the winning point in a spectacular display of athleticism and skill. The team erupted in celebration, with Samuel and Christopher embracing each other in the middle of the court. They had both learned valuable lessons that day: for Samuel, to trust in his team's ability to overcome challenges, and for Christopher, to recognize the usefulness of realistic thinking in achieving goals.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Floyd Lee Corkins charged in Family Research Council shooting According to an FBI affidavit made public Thursday, Corkins walked into the lobby of the conservative group’s headqurters shortly before 11 a.m. and encountered the guard, Leonardo Reno Johnson. A law enforcement official familiar with the incident but not authorized to talk about it, said Corkins asked to see someone Johnson didn’t know. Johnson has worked at the Council for 11 years and became suspicious. Corkins said he had the name in his bag, bent down and pulled out a 9mm handgun, the official said. Corkins said “I don’t like your politics,” according to the FBI affifavit. He then shot at Johnson, the affidavit said, and hit him in the arm. Johnson, wounded, wrestled the gun away and subdued Corkins, the affifavit said. If convicted, Corkins could face prison sentences of up to 10 years on the federal firearms charge and up to 30 on the District of Columbia assault charge. At Thursday’s hearing, Corkins appeared in white prison jumpsuit, walking into the courtroom quietly between two U.S. Marshals over which he towered. As Kay outlined the charges against him, he stood twirling his thumbs with his hands behind his back. Kay asked Corkins whether he had enough money to pay for an attorney; he said he did not. “I have about 300,” Corkins said in a soft, clear voice. In a Thursday morning interview, Leonardo Johnson’s mother said she was proud of her son for subduing the gunman and “so happy” to hear the District’s police chief call him a hero. “I’m sorry for what happened, and the way he got hurt,” Virginia Johnson said by telephone from her Southeast home. She spoke with her son, when he called from a hospital moments after she saw news of the shooting on television newscasts. “Yes, I’d say he was a hero,” said Virginia Johnson, 72. D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier credited Johnson with preventing a tragedy by stopping Corkins from reaching the upstairs offices in the group’s six-story building at Eighth and G streets NW. In the Thursday interview, Johnson’s mother said she thought her son was the one hurt even before his name emerged publicly because she knew where he worked. By the time he called her from the hospital, she said, “I was crying. I was upset. He was trying to calm me down.” Johnson said her son, who also lives in Southeast, didn’t provide many details of the incident. “He just told me, ‘Ma, I got shot.’ I said ‘I figured it was you.’ I said, ‘Where did you get shot at?’ He said ‘In the arm.’”","output":"Floyd Lee Corkins has been charged in connection with the shooting at the Family Research Council headquarters.

Egg yolks contain fat and protein that help moisturize and rejuvenate dry, lifeless hair. Separate the yolks from the whites and place the yolks in a small bowl. To easily separate an egg, crack the egg on the rim of the bowl. Hold the egg upright over a bowl and carefully lift the top half of the shell. Pass the yolk back and forth between the shell halves and let the white drop into the bowl, then place the yolk in a separate bowl. Alternatively, you may also use egg oil. To keep things neat, you might want to put your hair up in a loose bun and cover it with a shower cap. Wait patiently while the mask goes to work on your dry hair. The shampoo will remove excess oil and egg, leaving your hair shiny and soft with no buildup. Be sure to use cool or lukewarm water so the egg doesn't \\"cook\\" in your hair.

So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'.\\" There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\".

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, your finding from Google is correct regarding the first Honda car. The Honda S600, available as a roadster and a fastback coupé, was the first Honda automobile to be available in two trim levels. However, it is important to note that the Honda S600 is not the first car produced by Honda.  Honda's venture into the automobile industry began with the production of the T360 mini pickup truck and the S500, a sports car, in 1963. The S500, which was the predecessor to the S600, was the first production car to be manufactured by Honda. The S500 was a small, two-seat open-top sports car, featuring a 531cc engine with a four-speed manual transmission. This model was only produced for two years, from 1963 to 1964, before being replaced by the S600. The S600, introduced in 1964, was an upgrade from the S500, featuring a more powerful 606cc engine and more sophisticated specifications. Its distinguishing features included a chain-driven rear-wheel-drive system and independent suspension on all four wheels. The roadster version had a strong resemblance to the earlier Honda S500, while the fastback coupé model, launched in March 1965, became a new offering from Honda. As the successor of the S500, the S600 was a breakthrough for Honda in the automotive market, as it showcased the brand's technical expertise and engineering capabilities. The production of the S600 continued until 1966, when it was replaced by the Honda S800.  In conclusion, the answer you found on Google is correct in stating that the Honda S600 was the first Honda car available in two trim levels. However, it is important to note that the Honda S500 was the first car produced by Honda, predating the S600 by a year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by the Maya peoples, and noted for its hieroglyphic script--the only known fully developed writing system of the pre-Columbian Americas--as well as for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system. The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucatan Peninsula, and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain. The Archaic period, prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by sedentary communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines.  During the Middle Preclassic Period, small villages began to grow to form cities. Nakbe in the Peten department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands, where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC. The northern lowlands of Yucatan were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic. By approximately 400 BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae. A developed script was already being used in Peten by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of El Mirador grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres (6.2 sq mi). Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC.  In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic. Takalik Abaj and Chocola were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain, and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucatan. The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown.

Among the possible options provided, \\"higher intelligence\\" most closely aligns with this notion because it refers to a level of knowledge or understanding that goes beyond the typical human brain, implying a potentially superior or more advanced form of cognition. The other options can be evaluated as follows: 1. Culture: Although culture can shape beliefs and knowledge, it does not necessarily signify something beyond the human brain. 2. Inspiration: Inspiration may lead to new insights, but it does not inherently imply a higher form of intelligence. 3. Increasing knowledge: While increasing one's knowledge through studying might lead to a deeper understanding of various subjects, it does not directly correspond to the notion of something existing beyond man's brain. 4. Better grades: Better grades might indicate improved performance in a specific subject but is not directly connected to the idea of a higher intelligence beyond the human brain.

Premise: Manila children playing in spraying water on street while others watch.

Let's analyze both the premise and hypothesis to further understand why they cannot be directly linked or concluded to be true based on the other. Premise: \\"Manila children playing in spraying water on street while others watch.\\" This premise describes a scene where children in Manila are playing in spraying water on a street, and there are other people present who are watching the children play. This gives us information about the location (Manila), the activity (children playing in spraying water), and the presence of spectators (others watching). However, it does not provide any information about the game of hopscotch or whether people are watching kids playing hopscotch. Hypothesis: \\"People watch kids playing hop scotch.\\" The hypothesis posits that people watch kids playing hopscotch, which is a specific outdoor game involving hopping and jumping on numbered squares drawn on the ground. This game is different from the spraying water activity mentioned in the premise. The hypothesis does not explicitly state the location (unlike the premise), though it could be implied that it is a general statement about people watching kids playing hopscotch. Given the information available in both the premise and the hypothesis, we cannot conclusively state that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise does not provide enough information about the game of hopscotch or spectators watching kids play that specific game. The activities mentioned in both the premise and hypothesis are distinct and do not share common details. Furthermore, establishing a direct link between these two scenarios would require more information or additional context that specifically connects the two activities. In conclusion, the truth of the hypothesis cannot be determined based solely on the truth of the premise, as they both present different situations and do not share enough common details for one to imply the other. To evaluate the hypothesis's truth, we would need additional, relevant information or evidence regarding people watching kids playing hopscotch, independent of the premise provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? such a good job of it","output":"The phrase \\"such a good job of it\\" can be considered positive when used in a particular context. The statement implies that someone has performed an action or task with a high level of efficiency, quality, or effectiveness. When we break down the phrase, \\"such a good job\\" emphasizes the substantial quality of the work, while \\"of it\\" refers to the task or action specifically being discussed. In combination, they create a statement that focuses on the exceptional outcome of the effort. There are some factors that could influence whether this phrase is perceived as positive or negative. They include: 1. The context in which it is used: The situation in which this phrase is applied will largely determine whether it’s praised or disapproved. If uttered in genuine appreciation or admiration of someone's work, it shall carry an affirmative tone. However, if spoken sarcastically or within a negative context, the phrase may bear unfavorable connotations, but it's important to notice that the sarcasm would be derived not from the phrase itself but the tone of the speaker and the situation. 2. The person being addressed: The individual's perception of the phrase and their experiences can influence how they interpret the statement. For instance, if the person has received such remarks in the past, followed by strong criticism, they may perceive it as not entirely positive. 3. The speaker's intonation and demeanor: Oftentimes, nonverbal cues help discern the meaning and sentiment of a statement. For instance, if the speaker appears supportive and encouraging while saying the phrase, it is likely to be understood as positive. However, if their tone is sarcastic, dismissive, or indifferent, the counterpart might perceive the remark negatively. In summary, the phrase \\"such a good job of it\\" is generally considered positive as it acknowledges the quality of work or the successful completion of a task. However, the speaker's tone, the context, and the person being addressed could play a role in its final interpretation, but that will likely not change the inherently positive nature of the phrase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Background: Ski cross is a type of skiing competition. Despite its being a timed racing event, it is often considered part of freestyle skiing because it incorporates terrain features traditionally found in freestyle. Ski cross courses have both naturally occurring terrain and artificial features including big-air jumps and high-banked turns. What sets ski cross apart from other alpine skiing disciplines is that there's more than one skier racing down the course.[1] Any intentional contact with other competitors leads to disqualification.  Paragraph: Greg is an avid skier. He competes in many skiing competitions. He won several medals in those competitions. This November he will compete in two competitions - competition A, which is ski cross and competition B, which is an alpine skiing competition. Greg's fellow skier Bob is also competing in the same competitions. They both are exited about it.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If Greg does not want to compete with Bob racing   down the couse at the same time, which competitions   would they enter, competition A or competition B? Answer:","output":"If Greg does not want to compete with Bob racing down the course at the same time, they should enter competition B, which is an alpine skiing competition. Alpine skiing competitions feature individual timed runs, while ski cross (competition A) involves multiple skiers racing down the course simultaneously."},{"instruction":"Information:  - DreamCatcher Interactive Inc.

Satyrs were often depicted with exaggerated male genitalia, symbolizing lust and an uninhibited sex drive. Satyriasis in medical terms is considered to be a form of hypersexuality. This condition can lead to negative consequences, such as the inability to maintain healthy relationships, problems with work and social life, and potential legal issues if sexual behaviors become disruptive or nonconsensual.

The civil service which is supported by the federal, provincial and municipal governments has been the key to the expansion of the city's labour force and to the stability of its economy, which supports a sizable retail, service and business sector. The provincial government is the largest employer in the city, followed by Memorial University.

One of the most important ways to learn to become respectful of other cultures is to spend some time reflecting on your own beliefs and biases. Each of us has what is known as a \\" filter \\".","output":"This filter is the perspective through which we view the world and is shaped by our own personal experiences, values, upbringing, and education. Being self-aware of this filter and understanding that everyone has a unique perspective can help you become more receptive to different cultures and ideas that may not align with your own. Educate yourself about different cultures. You can begin by reading books, articles, watching documentaries, or attending cultural events that can help you broaden your knowledge of various cultures. Becoming knowledgeable about the history, customs, traditions, religious beliefs, and practices can help you develop a better understanding of different cultures and ultimately increase your respect for them. Be curious and open-minded. Adopting an attitude of curiosity and open-mindedness can lead to better appreciation and understanding of other cultures. Without judgment, seek to learn about the reasons behind certain cultural practices, and be open to the idea that different customs can be as valid and valuable as your own. Travel to different countries and places. One of the most effective ways to cultivate a deep respect for other cultures is by traveling and immersing yourself in various cultural experiences. By doing so, you will have the opportunity to interact with locals, learn about their way of life, and observe the cultural dynamics in different parts of the world firsthand. Engaging in cultural exchanges can help you develop empathy, understanding, and respect for other cultures. Practice active listening. Take the time to listen to the opinions, ideas, and experiences of those who come from different cultural backgrounds. This will give you a deeper understanding of their perspectives, which can foster greater respect for their culture. Additionally, being an active listener can make others feel more comfortable and valued when they share their thoughts with you, strengthening the quality of your interactions. Emphasize similarities over differences. While it's essential to recognize and appreciate cultural differences, it's also crucial to focus on the commonalities that unite us as human beings. This awareness will help to promote respect and understanding across cultural lines. Acknowledge and challenge stereotypes. Stereotypes are harmful generalizations that can lead to misunderstandings and perpetuate negative biases. Recognizing and challenging these stereotypes is key to respecting other cultures. It's important to remember that individuals are unique, and it's unfair to judge or categorize them based on preconceived ideas. Learn the basics about cultural etiquette. Understanding the basics of cultural etiquette and norms can help you demonstrate respect when interacting with individuals from various cultures. For example, learning how to greet someone properly or knowing the appropriate body language and gestures can make a big difference when establishing rapport with others. Respect cultural boundaries and customs. Every culture has its own set of boundaries and customs that are considered appropriate or acceptable. Demonstrating respect for other cultures involves being aware of these boundaries and following them when engaging with others.

Question: The answer to the question: What was the full name of the King of France? is inside the article: Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Trump's 'deeply un-American' stance on immigration prompts legal concerns A quarter century after the end of the cold war, Donald Trump has proposed restoring ideological tests for immigrants, a move that legal experts say raises a tangle of practical and even constitutional concerns. In a speech on Monday devoid of policy details or specifics, the Republican nominee called for the “extreme vetting” of immigrants, including a screening process to root out applicants who do not uphold “American values”. Laurence Tribe, a liberal constitutional law professor at Harvard University, said Trump’s proposal was “a nonstarter”. “The proposal ... is very deeply un-American, is probably unconstitutional, would almost certainly fail in Congress and is another example of Trump having no idea what he’s talking about,” he said. Restricting immigrants on the basis of ideology is anathema to American values, Tribe argues. Freedom of speech and religion are enshrined under the first amendment of the constitution and the enduring symbol of freedom is the Statue of Liberty welcoming weary immigrants to its shores. Related: McCarthyism redux: the long view of Trump's immigration plan | James Nevius Though immigrants outside the US would not receive the constitutional right to due process, Tribe said family members could bring challenges on their relatives’ behalves. Trump has long called for tightening immigration controls as part of his plan to defeat Islamic State. In 2015, Trump vowed to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US. In his speech on Monday, Trump appeared to revise that policy, calling for a temporary ban on immigrants from countries subject to terrorist attacks, though the original blanket ban on Muslims is still featured on his website. Trump’s proposal is not unprecedented. America has a long history of extreme vetting – which includes ideological tests – dating back to its foundation, when the leaders of the young nation worried anarchists would arrive and undermine the fledgling democracy. One of the earliest and most flagrant immigration laws was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which barred Chinese workers from entering the US. The ban, which was passed amid anxiety over job scarcity and a depressed economy, was later extended at the turn of the 20th century to in effect deny entry to all Asian immigrants. But Trump’s proposal draws from more recent history – the anti-communism measures employed during the cold war. “In the cold war, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today,” he said during a speech at Youngstown State University in Ohio. “I call it extreme vetting.” In 1952, Congress passed the McCarran–Walter Act, authorizing the federal government to refuse admission to classes of immigrants based on their political beliefs in an effort to keep members, former members and sympathizers of the communist party from entering the US. As the cold war came to a close, Congress revisited the law and in 1990 voted to greatly narrow the president’s ability to deny immigrant visas based on ideological grounds. Trump has claimed, citing the act, that he would have the authority as president to suspend entry to any class of person who would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States”. While the law grants the executive branch broad discretion over matters of immigration, the president would not have “absolute” authority – Congress could act to limit the president’s power. And yet if Trump managed to clear the initial hurdles and his proposal either passed Congress or survived the legal challenges experts say would surely arise, he would then have to contend with the operational difficulties of implementing such a sweeping proposal. “If he does try to implement an ideological test, that leads to a question which came up early in the cold war: how do you administer that? Is that a questionnaire? Do you investigate the answers? And if you do, how do you do that? Who does that?” said Carl Bon Tempo, author of Americans at the Gate: The United States and Refugees during the Cold War. “Enforcing an ideological litmus test takes an incredible amount of manpower and historically the result has been that it greatly slows the process.” Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University, is skeptical of Trump’s promise to enhance a process that is already extensive and lengthy. Immigrants applying to come to the US are already asked to respond to a questionnaire and are subject to a background check that vets for, among other things, links to terrorist or extremist groups. How is a border inspector supposed to determine whether an applicant is sufficiently ‘American’ in his or her thinking? “Immigration to the United States would grind to a near halt if millions of people are subject to background checks based on subjective criteria,” he said. “How is a consular officer or a border inspector supposed to determine whether an applicant is sufficiently ‘American’ in his or her thinking?” Based on Trump’s speech on Monday, Yale-Loehr speculated that the Republican might propose screening applicants’ social media pages as part of the routine background check. Currently, officials only run social media checks in certain cases. He could also add requirements that family members be brought in for interviews as part of the application process. But he said it would be impossible to implement these changes, since they would require a vast mobilization of resources and manpower. Trump’s campaign has said it would expand on his immigration proposals in the coming weeks, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Still, experts say that on its surface, the proposal poses major logistical and practical problems that agencies grappled with during the cold war in the 1950s and, more recently, in the post-9/11 years. In vilifying the immigrant, Trump is using a familiar playbook from American history, said Erika Lee, a professor of immigration history at the University of Minnesota. Throughout history, politicians exploited public anxiety over a scarcity of jobs and threats to national security to push through exclusionary laws. “For many Americans, when they think back to America’s history, it’s the Ellis Island story. This is the way our mythology works,” Lee said. “But that has created some rose-colored glasses and helped to obscure the other side of the story, the one where we exclude whole groups of people based on race, ethnicity or ideological belief.” Summary:","output":"In a speech on Monday, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, suggested that the US should apply extreme vetting for immigrants, including a screening process to encourage those who do not uphold \\"American values\\", a move that legal experts argue raises significant constitutional concerns, according to The Guardian.

His life is disrupted when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads, and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental-health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorcÃ©. The watch members use the group as an excuse to drink and have fun (much to Evan's annoyance). While driving on patrol, they accidentally hit something. They discover a strange metallic orb that acts as a highly-destructive weapon, and deduce that it is of alien origin. Meanwhile, several more townspeople are mysteriously killed. The watch responds to the murders and encounters an alien, which attacks them. Evan (apparently) kills it with a lawn gnome before the group returns with the creature to Bob's house.

Background: Aaron Turner (born November 5, 1977) is an American musician, singer, graphic artist, and founder of label Hydra Head Records. He is most widely known for his role as guitarist and vocalist for the post-metal band Isis, while also participating in several other bands and projects such as Old Man Gloom, Lotus Eaters and Split Cranium, a collaboration with Jussi Lehtisalo of Finnish band Circle who toured with Isis in 2009. Though raised in New Mexico, Turner moved to the Boston area where he attended school and formed Isis and Hydra Head. In June 2003, Turner moved operations of both the band and label to Los Angeles, California. Context: Touring with Isis in 2007, Turner used two different guitars: a 1976 Fender Telecaster Custom (black), and a 1975 Fender Telecaster Deluxe (brown), played through various effects (his pedalboard layout changed every gig depending on what songs the band decided to play that night), a VHT/Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, and two 4x12 Sunn cabinets. He has also acquired a custom guitar from the Electrical Guitar Company (as did fellow Isis guitarist Michael Gallagher).  In the past, Turner has also used a Gibson Les Paul Standard, PRS CE24, and has played through Sunn, Mesa Boogie, and Mackie amplifiers.  When playing with Isis, Turner and his fellow guitarists usually tuned their instruments (low to high) B-F#-B-E-G#-B, to achieve a heavier sound. They also used other tunings, though less frequently, such as F# (octave below)-F#-B-E-G#-B.  In 2016, Turner described the live rig he used with SUMAC as consisting of two custom-built guitars from the Electrical Guitar Company. Both have lucite bodies and aluminum necks, and custom-wound wide frequency range pickups. The newer of the two--a prototype for a signature model--has a slightly flatter fingerboard radius than the older instrument. On a tour of the Eastern US, Turner was using an Orange Dual Dark 100 amplifier head with a slaved Fryette Two/Ninety/Two power amp. Both heads drove Orange and Marshall cabinets, though Turner claimed to have no strong preferences for particular speaker cabinets. While recording, Turner prefers to use a Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, an amp model he's used consistently since his work in Isis. Turner described using a variety of effects pedals in his live rig. Specifically, he runs a BOSS TU-3 Chromatic Tuner, a Death By Audio Apocalypse fuzz, a MASF fuzz, a Strymon BlueSky reverb (which he described as the one essential pedal in his rig), a TC Electronics Ditto Looper X2, and an EHX Forty-Five Thousand sampler (used to trigger preset samples during performance. Turner prefers a Heil PR20 vocal microphone. Question: What type of amplifiers did he use? Answer:","output":"Aaron Turner has used various amplifiers throughout his musical career.

This will then allow us to determine whether the given premise entails the hypothesis \\"If your visitors come, I will talk to them.\\" The premise consists of two main parts: a commitment and a condition.  1. Commitment: \\"I will speak with your visitors as I agreed\\" 2. Condition: \\"if they come\\" The condition, \\"if they come,\\" indicates that the speaker will only fulfill the commitment if the condition is met, i.e., the visitors arrive. This means that the commitment (speaking with the visitors) depends upon the fulfillment of the condition (the visitors coming). Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"If your visitors come, I will talk to them.\\" This statement is structured as a conditional statement, with the antecedent being \\"your visitors come\\" and the consequent being \\"I will talk to them.\\" If the antecedent (the visitors coming) is true, the speaker is promising to fulfill the consequent (talking to the visitors). Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that both statements essentially convey the same meaning. The premise is expressing a commitment made by the speaker to talk to the visitors on the condition that they come. The hypothesis, as a conditional statement, asserts that the speaker will engage in conversation with the visitors if they arrive. Thus, it can be concluded that if the premise \\"I will speak with your visitors as I agreed, if they come\\" is true, it does entail the hypothesis \\"If your visitors come, I will talk to them.\\" This is because both statements present the same relationship between the commitment of talking to the visitors and the condition of the visitors arriving.

Input: Paragraph: Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been implicated in the etiology of adult communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). We investigated RSV infection in Chilean adults with CAP using direct viral detection, real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR), and serology (microneutralization assay). Methods. RSV, other respiratory viruses, and bacteria were studied by conventional and molecular techniques in adults aged 18 years presenting with CAP to the healthcare facilities in Santiago, Chile from February 2005 through December 2007. Results. All 356 adults with CAP enrolled had an acute blood sample collected at enrollment, and 184 had a convalescent blood sample. RSV was detected in 48 cases (13.4%). Immunofluorescence assay and viral isolation each detected only 1 infection (0.2%), whereas rtRT-PCR was positive in 32 (8.9%) cases and serology was positive in 20 (10.8%) cases. CAP clinical characteristics were similar in RSV-infected and non-RSV-infected cases. RSV-specific geometric mean serum-neutralizing antibody titer (GMST) was significantly lower at admission in the 48 RSV-infected cases compared with 308 non-RSV-infected adults (GMST in log 2 : RSV/A 8.1 vs 8.9, and RSV/B 9.3 vs 10.4; P , .02). Conclusions. RSV infection is frequent in Chilean adults with CAP. Microneutralization assay was as sensitive as rtRT-PCR in detecting RSV infection and is a good adjunct assay for diagnostic research. High RSV-specific serum-neutralizing antibody levels were associated with protection against common and severe infection. The development of a vaccine could prevent RSV-related CAP in adults.

The devastating case has highlighted the issue of domestic violence and captured public attention throughout the nation. The man, whose name has been withheld to protect the privacy of the surviving family members, confessed to the gruesome homicides in his initial appearance in front of the judge. Court records indicate that he strangled his pregnant wife and drowned their three young children, aged 2, 4, and 6, in the family bathtub. Following these heinous acts, the perpetrator wrapped the lifeless bodies of his family in plastic bags and dumped them in a nearby wooded area. Upon discovering the grisly scene, law enforcement officers acted quickly to launch a thorough investigation. Gathering evidence and interrogating potential witnesses, the detectives managed to piece together the frightening sequence of events that led to the devastating loss of life. Ultimately, the man's confession confirmed their suspicions and solidified the case against him. Throughout the trial, the courtroom remained tense as chilling details emerged. The defense team argued that the man's behavior was influenced by a myriad of factors, including drug addiction, financial stress, and undiagnosed mental health issues. However, the prosecution countered these arguments, emphasizing that regardless of his personal struggles, he made the choice to violently end the lives of his family members - an act that is deemed inexcusable under any circumstance. As the trial progressed, testimonies from various sources painted a disturbing picture of the man's troubled past. Relationships with former partners had been marked by instances of abuse and manipulation, whereas colleagues and acquaintances recalled sudden mood swings and erratic behavior. This background information provided a vital context that allowed the jury to better understand the accused's actions. After a highly emotional and tense trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of multiple counts of first-degree murder and the judge subsequently sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This sentence, while unable to bring back the lives of the victims, serves to provide a sense of closure and justice for the bereaved family and the entire community. The tragedy of this case has ignited a broader discussion on the importance of addressing mental health issues, seeking treatment for addiction, and promoting domestic violence prevention resources. In light of such heinous acts, it is crucial that individuals who are struggling in their relationships or personal lives receive the support they need to prevent future violence. As the community grapples with the aftermath of this unfathomable loss, law enforcement and social service agencies have vowed to increase their vigilance in identifying and addressing potential cases of domestic abuse. The public, too, must remain vigilant to signs of distress and conflict within their networks and support those in need. The case serves as an urgent reminder that behind closed doors, anyone can be vulnerable to the tragic consequences of domestic violence. It is essential that the societal stigma surrounding these issues be dismantled, and everyone play their part in creating a safer, more inclusive environment for those in need of help."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After Han mends Dre's injuries using fire cupping, Dre asks if Mr. Han could teach him kung fu to get revenge on his attackers. Han refuses, but meets Cheng's teacher, Master Li, to make peace. Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. Seeing a poster for an open martial arts tournament, Han instead proposes that Dre compete against Li's students there. He also requests that the stronger students that Li teaches leave Dre alone to train in time for the tournament, in hopes Dre will no longer be bullied. Li accepts the offer, but tells Han that if Dre does not show up, there will trouble for both Han and Dre. Han promises to teach Dre \\"real\\" kung fu and begins to train Dre by emphasizing movements that apply to life in general, and that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial art. He teaches this by having Dre go through various actions with his jacket, which teaches Dre muscle memory moves. Han then takes Dre to a divine temple in the Wudang Mountains where he trained with his father hundreds of years ago, and Dre witnesses a woman making a king cobra reflect her movements, and Dre and drinks the water from a secret, ancient Chinese well for good luck.

Blink-182 (often stylized as blink-182; pronounced \\"blink one eighty two\\") is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Since 2015, the lineup of the band has consisted of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Founded by guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; in response, the band appended the meaningless number \\"-182\\". Hoppus and Barker decided to continue on without DeLonge, and enlisted Alkaline Trio vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba to \\"fill in\\" for three shows in March 2015. Hoppus and Skiba had been wanting to work together musically for several years, so he was the first and only person considered for the role. After legal battles with DeLonge were worked out, Skiba joined Blink-182 as an official member and began preparations for new music. The resulting album, California, was produced by John Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn. California was recorded between January and March 2016. The band, as well as Feldmann, would regularly spend \\"18 hours\\" in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. \\"We all wanted to write the best record that we could [...] It does feel like a new beginning. It feels like when we used to tour and sleep in the van because that's all we wanted to do is play rock music,\\" said Hoppus.  Upon its July 2016 release, California became the band's second number-one album on the Billboard 200, and first in 15 years; it also reached the top for the first time in the United Kingdom. Its lead single, \\"Bored to Death\\", became the group's first number one single in 12 years. The band supported the album with a large headlining tour across North America between July and October 2016, and a European leg in June and July 2017. A deluxe edition of California--essentially a double album including songs left off the original album--was issued in 2017. California earned the band their first nomination for Best Rock Album at the Grammy Awards. Critical reviews of the album, however, were mixed; many considered Feldmann's input and the throwback nature of the songs as formulaic.  Recently, the band has taken time off and are preparing to record their eighth studio album. \\"Somehow, Blink has had this resurgence like we never expected,\\" Hoppus told Kerrang! in July 2017. \\"I count myself lucky to have been [playing in the band] as long as I have.\\"  The band signed a 16-date residency deal with the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The shows, known as \\"Kings of the Weekend,\\" will take place on select weekends beginning May 26, 2018. The last show is on November 17, 2018.","output":"This text is about the American rock band Blink-182."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Hilary Freeman. When I introduced my boyfriend Mickael to my father, I desperately hoped they’d get on. I feared my dad might take umbrage at his modest job as a hotel receptionist, or his thick French accent — but I could never have predicted what actually set him off: Mickael’s looks. ‘He’s very handsome,’ said Dad. ‘Are you sure he’s faithful to you?’ This was three years ago and Mickael and I were in a long-distance relationship at the time. I lived in London, he was 650 miles away in Nice, and my father simply couldn’t accept that ‘someone as good-looking as Mickael’ wouldn’t be cheating on me at every opportunity. Hot topic: Hilary and 'Le Hunk' Mickael. I was devastated that he could say something so insensitive, and offended because I was very aware he wouldn’t have said it had my boyfriend looked like John Major. A wave of insecurity flooded over me. What did Mickael, now 38 see in a diminutive, curly-haired specimen like me? At 6ft 2in tall, with broad shoulders, black hair, a Roman nose and incredible blue eyes, Mickael is the living embodiment of tall, dark and handsome. He isn’t just good-looking, he’s movie-star handsome. At college, he was picked to play Rhett Butler in a Gone With The Wind adaptation and he’s been approached by model scouts wanting to sign him up. I know I sound smug, but bear with me. Because having a handsome boyfriend isn’t all it is cracked up to be. As I’ve learned to my cost, people make assumptions about good-looking men.  Most of them, in my experience, are false and offensive. Just as blonde women are pigeon-holed as being stupid, handsome men are written off as lacking moral fibre. Most people assume they can’t be trusted around the opposite sex. They are also assumed to be shallow, vain and sex-obsessed. As a drop-dead gorgeous man’s girlfriend you have to be tough. You need a thick skin, high self-esteem and the ability not to care what other people think. Unfortunately for me, I possess none of these qualities. To paraphrase the 18th-century novelist, Samuel Richardson: ‘Handsome boyfriends often make a girlfriend’s heart ache.’ Mickael constantly tells Hilary shes pretty and says all his friends and family think so, too. He even loves her 'gappy teeth and big nose' Especially if said girlfriend is 42, 5ft 3in, with a big nose, hair that’s prone to frizz and gappy teeth. I’ve never had a problem attracting men, but I’m not conventionally beautiful and certainly not leading-lady material — unless that leading lady is Barbra Streisand. In a romcom, I’d be the kooky best friend, not the girl who gets the guy. If I were to award myself marks out of ten, I’d be a six — six-and-a-half on a good-hair day. Mickael would be a nine. In other words, he’s ‘out of my league’. But he doesn’t seem to care. More important to us is the silly sense of humour we share that can have us both in fits for hours. He constantly tells me I’m pretty and says all his friends and family think so, too. He even loves my gappy teeth and big nose. Now, that should be enough shouldn’t it? And, most of the time, it is. I know, without a doubt, that Mickael loves me. We’ve been through a lot together, including the stillbirth of our daughter 18 months ago. He’s given up his job at a hotel in Nice, his friends and his home country, and moved to London to live with me in Camden Town. So I know I shouldn’t feel insecure. Yet I often do. Men who feel they've 'lucked out' by marrying attractive women are more likely to care about their wives' needs, says a US study. We live in a shallow, looks-obsessed society, in which being beautiful is the most valuable currency. People stare at us in the street and — call me paranoid — I can tell that some of them are wondering what someone so handsome is doing with ordinary little me. Through the grapevine, I’ve heard reports of acquaintances making nasty, jealous comments about us, such as: ‘She’s punching above her weight.’ Although all of my previous partners have been attractive in my eyes, until Mickael I’d never had a partner universally considered handsome. Everyone, from friends — both straight and gay — to my 95-year-old grandma,  has commented on his good  looks. Friends have even nicknamed him ‘Le Hunk’. Several have even sent me emails — usually drunken — which begin: ‘I know this is probably really inappropriate, but can I just say that your boyfriend is really hot.’ Sometimes this makes me feel like I’m the owner of a prize bull at the county fair. People have actually congratulated me on my ‘achievement’, as though snaring a good-looking man is like winning an award, or gaining a promotion. Pleasing as it is that other people appreciate my good taste and good fortune, all this hyperbole means I’m only too aware that if our relationship were ever to go wrong, there would be a long queue of women ready to take my place. I’m not naturally jealous, but it’s hard not to look over my shoulder.And then there are Mickael’s beautiful exes who, through no fault of their own, make me feel inferior. At least two of his ex-girlfriends have modelled. He’s still good friends with one of them: a tall, sexy, willowy girl, ten years my junior, with thighs the size of my arms and men trailing in her wake wherever she goes. ‘I’m with you, not her,’ Mickael pointed out, when in a moment of weakness I confessed my sense of inadequacy. And that is true. But sometimes — usually when I’m contemplating my cellulite or finding a new grey hair — I can’t help wondering why a man who could have someone like her would want someone like me. Hilary says: 'Several have even sent me emails - usually drunken - which begin: 'I know this is probably really inappropriate, but can I just say that your boyfriend is really hot' I also worry more than I should — or ever have before — about getting fat, developing wrinkles and becoming middle-aged. Mickael reassures me by saying how much he loves my eyes and my smile, and reminding me that he can’t keep his hands off me. He talks of growing old with me and I know that, being French, he thinks older women can be just as attractive as younger ones. Supermodels aren’t even to his taste — he finds the majority superficial and lacking in character. To state the obvious, a good-looking man is no different from any other man, and a handsome face and a good character aren’t mutually exclusive. As I pointed out to my dad, just because good looks afford you more opportunities to cheat, it doesn’t mean that you’ll take them. If anything, I think the opposite is true. When you are attractive, and you can have pretty much anyone you want, there’s less motivation to do so. In my experience, it’s the insecure men, the ones who aren’t confident in themselves or their looks, who need to chat up women in order to prove their own self-worth. That’s why so many balding, paunchy men have mid-life crises and go after younger women. Mickael knows he’s handsome, but he isn’t arrogant, or vain. He cares about his appearance, but isn’t obsessed with it. He has the confidence and self-assurance of someone who has never had to try too hard. Believe it or not, he tells me he’s never actively chatted anyone up and can only remember one occasion when he was rejected by a woman. If he likes someone, and they’re single, it usually goes without saying they will like him back. The downside is that he’s been sexually harassed by strange women in bars (one thought it was fine to stroke him, without even saying hello first), and he often has to fend off the attentions of men, too. Being handsome can be dangerous. Mickael spent a week in hospital, and still has a pin in his jaw, after being punched  — from behind — by a man who took offence when he made polite smalltalk with the man’s girlfriend. In some workplaces, he has been met with cold, aggressive behaviour from other guys. One colleague told him: ‘If I had a face like yours, I’d keep my mouth shut.’ A former friend admitted he liked going out with Mickael, not so much because he enjoyed his company, but because it helped him to pull women. As a friendly, loyal and sociable person, Mickael finds these attitudes hard to deal with — and so do I. But it might not be a problem for too much longer. Even movie star looks fade. As he nears the end of his 30s, he has started to sprout random hairs from his ears, is growing wayward, Denis Healey eyebrows, and he is battling against the development of the family double chin. He is near-sighted, suffers from a bad back and his love for French food and wine means that he doesn’t have anything resembling a six pack. And for these flaws, I am truly thankful. The fact is I don’t love Mickael because he’s handsome, although it doesn’t hurt. I love him because he’s funny, kind and thoughtful. It’s when I’m lying in his arms, in the dark —  when I can’t see him — that I am at my most content. As the old proverb goes: ‘Handsome is as handsome does.’ I am absolutely certain that if he lost his looks tomorrow, I’d love him as much as ever.

Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In Hilary Freeman's article, she shares her experience of dating a \\"movie-star handsome\\" man, Mickael, discussing the challenges and assumptions that come with it. The couple faced long-distance struggles and the devastating loss of their baby at birth, but they remained strong together. However, Hilary's insecurities stemmed from living in a looks-obsessed society, where she felt constantly judged and compared to Mickael's beautiful exes. She found having a handsome boyfriend required a thick skin and high self-esteem, which she admits to lacking. Despite the challenges, Mickael's character, humor, and kindness remained the reason Hilary loves him rather than just his looks, as she feels most content when in his arms in the dark. She assures herself that even if he lost his looks tomorrow, she would still love him.

The woman opted to ride the bus instead of the train because the","output":"The woman opted to ride the bus instead of the train because the bus stopped closer to her office. This decision was based on a variety of factors that she had carefully considered in order to make her daily commute as efficient and comfortable as possible. First and foremost, the proximity of the bus stop to her office provided her with an unmatched level of convenience. By choosing to utilize the bus service, she was able to save precious time and energy as the walking distance from the bus stop to her workplace was significantly shorter compared to that from the train station. This was especially important during inclement weather, when traveling on foot can be uncomfortable, or even dangerous due to slippery or icy conditions. Another important consideration for her choice was the fact that the bus route was less crowded than the train. In general, buses tend to provide a more relaxed and enjoyable travel experience due to the availability of seating and the reduced number of commuters. This meant that she could enjoy a more peaceful ride to and from work while being able to comfortably read a book, catch up on her emails, or simply use the time to mentally prepare for the day ahead. Additionally, buses often run at more frequent intervals throughout the day compared to trains. This provided her with greater flexibility in terms of her schedule, which was a significant advantage as she was able to better manage her time both before and after work, attending to personal errands or adjusting her hours if she needed to stay late at the office. Moreover, the bus service provided a more cost-effective solution for her transportation needs. The fare for the bus was less expensive than the train fare, which allowed her to save money on a daily basis. This financial aspect was yet another important factor that influenced her decision to ride the bus instead of the train. Lastly, taking the bus allowed her to explore her local surroundings and observe aspects of the city that she would have otherwise missed had she opted for the train. By engaging in this form of transportation, she was able to enjoy the ever-changing landscape and view points of interest along the bus route, creating a richer and more stimulating experience. Overall, the woman's choice to ride the bus instead of the train was primarily due to the convenient location of the bus stop in relation to her office. However, her decision was further reinforced by the multitude of additional benefits that the bus service provided over its rail counterpart, such as a less crowded and more comfortable commuting experience, greater scheduling flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and exposure to the local scenery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote. Among Bizet's contemporaries, the dramatist Ludovic Halévy wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality: \\"I persist in finding in [the score] the rarest virtues\\".

Thomas Nast (; German: [nast]; September 27, 1840 - December 7, 1902) was a German-born American caricaturist and editorial cartoonist considered to be the \\"Father of the American Cartoon\\". He was the scourge of Democratic Representative \\"Boss\\" Tweed and the Tammany Hall Democratic party political machine. In 1890, Nast published Thomas Nast's Christmas Drawings for the Human Race. He contributed cartoons in various publications, notably the Illustrated American, but was unable to regain his earlier popularity. His mode of cartooning had come to be seen as outdated, and a more relaxed style exemplified by the work of Joseph Keppler was in vogue. Health problems, which included pain in his hands which had troubled him since the 1870s, affected his ability to work.  In 1892, he took control of a failing magazine, the New York Gazette, and renamed it Nast's Weekly. Now returned to the Republican fold, Nast used the Weekly as a vehicle for his cartoons supporting Benjamin Harrison for president. The magazine had little impact and ceased publication seven months after it began, shortly after Harrison's defeat.  The failure of Nast's Weekly left Nast with few financial resources. He received a few commissions for oil paintings and drew book illustrations. In 1902, he applied for a job in the State Department, hoping to secure a consular position in western Europe. Although no such position was available, President Theodore Roosevelt was an admirer of the artist and offered him an appointment as the United States' Consul General to Guayaquil, Ecuador in South America. Nast accepted the position and traveled to Ecuador on July 1, 1902. During a subsequent yellow fever outbreak, Nast remained on the job, helping numerous diplomatic missions and businesses escape the contagion. He contracted the disease and died on December 7 of that year. His body was returned to the United States, where he was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

Question: North Korea’s release of three U.S. citizens may help pave the way for talks between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, but questions remain as to whether those talks will succeed. At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting.  The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president. Question: after the story ends does Pyongyang take more prisoners? Options: - Probably Pyongyang only takes 1 or 2 more prisoners   - Probably Pyongyang stops taking prisoners   - Probably Pyongyang continues to take many prisoners   - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"Not enough information While it is difficult to predict the exact behavior of Pyongyang after the story ends, it is important to consider several factors that could influence their decision on whether to take more prisoners or not. These factors include: 1. The success of the Trump-Kim summit and the progress made in denuclearization talks: If the summit and the subsequent negotiations are successful in easing tensions between North Korea and the United States, it is possible that Pyongyang may refrain from taking more American prisoners as a means to maintain goodwill and avoid provoking any negative reactions from the U.S. 2. North Korea's internal politics and decision-making processes: The actions of the North Korean government, particularly those related to foreign policy, can be highly unpredictable. It may be challenging to glean reliable insight into the motivations of the regime, even after considering the release of prisoners and the conduct of high-level talks. 3. Developments in U.S.-North Korea relations beyond the scope of the story: Even if the summit and negotiations are initially successful, the future course of U.S.-North Korea relations may be influenced by a variety of factors, such as changes in political leadership, unforeseen crises, or the situations in South Korea and China. 4. The behavior of American citizens visiting North Korea: While it is unlikely that U.S. citizens would deliberately engage in activities that would result in their arrest and detainment, it is possible that inadvertent actions or misunderstandings could lead to future instances of North Korea taking American citizens into custody. Given these factors, it is difficult to definitively determine which of the provided options is most likely.

He said he took the threat by the Somali-based group al-Shabab seriously. In a video, the group urged followers to carry out attacks on shopping centres in the US, Canada and the UK. Al-Shabab was responsible for the 2013 attack on Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi that killed 67 people. Mr Johnson told CNN that the threat was part of \\"a new phase\\" of terrorism in which attacks would increasingly come from \\"independent actors in their homelands\\". \\"Anytime a terrorist organisation calls for an attack on a specific place, we've got to take that seriously,\\" he said. But Mr Johnson added that he was not advising people not to go to the malls named by the militants. In the video, a man with a British-sounding accent and full face covering calls on supporters of al-Shabab to attack \\"American or Jewish-owned\\" Western shopping centres. He specifically mentions Minnesota's Mall of America - the second-largest US shopping centre - and Canada's West Edmonton Mall, as well as London's Oxford Street and the UK capital's two Westfield shopping centres. Co-ordinates for the various targets were listed on the screen as they were described. The BBC's Naomi Grimley in Washington says it is possible that the video is part of a rivalry between al-Shabab, which is linked to al-Qaeda, and Islamic State, which has dominated media coverage recently. UK police said they were aware of the video and assessing the contents. Both Mall of America and West Edmonton Mall have issued statements saying they were implementing additional security measures.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

In August 2010, the SSA opened its fifth and largest videoconferencing-only National Hearing Center (NHC), in St. Louis, Missouri. This continues the SSA's effort to use video hearings as a means to clear its substantial hearing backlog. Since 2007, the SSA has also established NHCs in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Baltimore, Maryland, Falls Church, Virginia, and Chicago, Illinois. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Where is the SSA's fifth videoconferencing only center located?","output":"The answer to the question is: The SSA's fifth videoconferencing-only center is located in St. Louis, Missouri."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is a goal: how do you hold your breath? Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To hold your breath effectively, follow these steps: 1. Find a comfortable position: Stand, sit, or lay down in a comfortable position to ensure that your breathing remains stable and uninterrupted. 2. Take a deep breath: Inhale deeply through your nose, filling your lungs with air. Focus on expanding your chest and diaphragm, ensuring you are taking in as much air as possible. 3. Close both your mouth and nostrils: Once you have filled your lungs with air, close your mouth and pinch your nostrils together with your thumb and index finger. This step prevents any air from escaping. 4. Set a mental timer: As you begin holding your breath, set a mental timer or count the seconds in your mind. This helps you keep track of the duration and maintain focus on holding your breath. 5. Stay relaxed: As you hold your breath, try to remain calm and composed. This allows your body to perform better under reduced oxygen conditions. 6. Release your breath when necessary: When you feel the urge to breathe, slowly let the air out of your lungs through your mouth. It's essential to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard in holding your breath. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal depends on the context. If you're looking for a straightforward technique for holding your breath, the steps mentioned above should suffice. In competitive situations like freediving or swimming, the technique may need to be modified or enhanced for optimal performance, safety, and personal preference."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Short movie review: endure instead of enjoy  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the given short movie review, \\"endure instead of enjoy,\\" it is evident that the critic was thinking negatively of the movie. Let me provide a more detailed analysis of the statement and its negative connotation. The verb \\"endure\\" refers to tolerating, bearing, or suffering something, typically an unpleasant or difficult circumstance. This term suggests that the critic had to bear with the movie's content or elements rather than genuinely deriving pleasure from it. This sentiment insinuates that the movie might have had several flaws or weaknesses, making it a bothersome viewing experience for the critic. On the other hand, the verb \\"enjoy\\" implies experiencing pleasure, satisfaction, or appreciation. By stating \\"endure instead of enjoy,\\" the critic highlights that the movie failed to evoke positive emotions or entertain effectively. This expectation indicates that the critic did not find the movie stimulating, thought-provoking, or gratifying in any manner. Moreover, the word \\"instead\\" further enhances the negative evaluation of the movie. It contrasts the two opposing actions – enduring versus enjoying – and reinforces the idea that the critic could only withstand the movie, rather than savor it. So, it can be inferred that the critic indeed thought negatively of the movie. In summary, based on the short movie review provided, the critic was thinking negatively about the movie. The use of the verb \\"endure,\\" as opposed to \\"enjoy,\\" underscores dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction, implying the movie was not an enjoyable or pleasurable experience."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q: It sounds like I'm the asshole but hear me out. I became friends with this silent girl when I first started the university. Let's call her Susan. It was the first year, so we made different friends at the end of the year. However her friend failed the class and she started to sit near me in the classroom again. I introduced her to my close friend, let's call her Jane, and we started to hang out as a trio. I and Jane were both talkative, so when all of us were together we were making the most of the conversations. Susan was still silent. We tried to make her talk. She should be talking with us at least. Because we told everything about our lives to her but we barely knew her. It wasn't fair.  A lot of things happened but let's fast-forward to the last year. We had a thesis and we had to read articles in English, because there was no research that was done in our country about that subject. Yet Susan was not helping. She was always saying: \\"your English is better than mine, I can't understand the articles\\". She was not even trying. I could speak English but I also didn't understand articles at the beginning. With reading a lot, Jane and I started to be more competent about the subject we were working on. Our professor was delighted but she wasn't seeing Susan's lack of effort. Moreover, she wasn't listening us when we were talking even in daily things like what we should eat when we get home. She was always on her phone and it was driving us crazy.  Long story to short, we were *close* friends but she never shared anything about her life or her thoughts, never did anything that she didn't want to, even if that means we would have to do her parts in the projects, never listened us enough to care. And we were *close* but when I had some tough times, she didn't even call even though she knew and that was the final straw. I ended our friendship. I know shy people struggle to communicate but I don't think she's that shy. I think she's just using her shyness as an excuse. I always felt that she didn't care for us in the same way we cared for her, so after ending our friendship, I felt relieved. Now, am I the asshole for leaving that shy, lonely girl by herself?

The triple is a structured set of data that provides specific information about a thing (subject), a feature of that thing (predicate), and the details of that feature (object). 2. In this triple, \\"Bananaman\\" is the subject, \\"Starring\\" and \\"First_aired\\" are the predicates, and \\"Bill Oddie\\" and \\"1983-10-03\\" are the objects. 3.

Given the question: Information:  - Signs is an American reggaeton duet . Originally a trio , the group eventually became a duo including Yarimar Huertas and Yalixia Figueroa .  - Reggaeton (also known as reggaetón and reguetón) is a musical genre which originated in Puerto Rico during the late 1990s. It is influenced by hip hop and Latin American and Caribbean music. Vocals include rapping and singing, typically in Spanish.  - Latin America is a group of countries and dependencies in the Americas where Romance languages are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as \\"Amérique latine\\" to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms Ibero-America or Hispanic Americathough it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Rapping (or emceeing, MCing, or rhyming) is \\"spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics\\". The components of rapping include \\"content\\", \\"flow\\" (rhythm and rhyme), and \\"delivery\\". Rapping is distinct from spoken-word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat (external meter). Rapping is often associated with and a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon can be said to predate hip-hop culture by centuries. It can also be found in alternative rock such as that of Cake, Gorillaz and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Rapping is also used in Kwaito music, a genre that originated in Johannesburg, South Africa, and is composed of hip-hop elements. Another form of rap that predates hip hop was Muhammad Ali's rhythmic poetry used to taunt his opponents in the 1960s and 1970s.  - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.

From the text, it appears that the user is asking if this group or organization is working for someone else and mentions that it's not working for them. To analyze the sentiment of the tweet, we can break it down into several components: 1. \\"@Shannyn808\\" - The mention of a specific user suggests that the tweeter is directly addressing someone, likely seeking their opinion on the matter. The sentiment here could be seen as neutral or slightly inquisitive. 2. \\"Is 140 mafia working 4 u?\\" - The wording \\"working 4 u\\" implies that the tweeter is curious to know if this \\"140 mafia\\" is benefiting or serving the person they are addressing. In this context, the sentiment may be seen as inquisitive or even skeptical. 3. \\"It's not 4 me.\\" - This statement explicitly conveys a negative sentiment from the user, as they are saying that the \\"140 mafia\\" is not working for them. It could be interpreted as a degree of dissatisfaction, disappointment, or even frustration with the situation. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as a combination of inquisitive, skeptical, and negative emotions. The tweeter appears to be seeking the opinion or experience of another user regarding the \\"140 mafia.\\" At the same time, they express their dissatisfaction with the fact that it's not working for them. The overall sentiment, therefore, leans more towards the negative side, as it conveys a sense of unhappiness with a situation and a search for validation from others who might have had a similar experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who smuggles tht Marquis's manuscript out? Movie title: Quills Movie plot: Quills begins in Paris during the Reign of Terror, with the incarcerated Marquis de Sade penning a story about the libidinous Mademoiselle Renard, a ravishing young aristocrat who meets the preeminent sadist in her executioner. Several years later, the Marquis is confined to the asylum for the insane at Charenton, overseen by the enlightened AbbÃ© du Coulmier. The Marquis has been publishing his work through laundress Madeleine \\"Maddy\\" LeClerc, who smuggles manuscripts through an anonymous horseman to a publisher. The Marquis' latest work, Justine, is published on the black market to great success. Emperor NapolÃ©on I Bonaparte orders all copies of the book to be torched and the author shot, but his advisor, DelbenÃ©, tempers this contentious idea with one of his own: send alienist Dr. Royer-Collard to assess Charenton and silence the Marquis. Meanwhile, the AbbÃ© teaches Madeleine to read and write and resists his growing attraction to her. Madeleine reads the Marquis de Sade's stories to her fellow workers. Whilst Madeleine is fascinated by the Marquis de Sade she remains reluctant to give into his advances. The AbbÃ© and Marquis converse on the Marquis' inappropriate advances on young women. Dr. Royer-Collard arrives, informing the AbbÃ© that the Marquis' \\"therapeutic writings\\" have been distributed for public consumption.

Big, big sigh of relief among Russia's super-rich, as the West announces \\"smart sanctions\\" against a group of Kremlin officials and members of Russian parliament in response to the referendum that took place in Crimea and produced a result resembling the elections in the old Soviet Union: 96.7% of the people who took part in it voted for the peninsula to become part of Russia. The joke on the streets of Moscow is that the politicians took the bullet for the oligarchs, not for the first time and not the last. But jokes aside, the fate of Crimea is sealed. It will become part of Russia in about three months' time and, as things stand now, President Vladimir Putin has already signed an executive order recognizing the peninsula as an independent state, confirming his determination to stick to his guns in his address to the Federal Assembly. The Russian leader has gone way too far in his attempt to prevent Crimea -- with two thirds of its population made up of ethnic Russians -- from sliding into mayhem to pull back now, sanctions or no sanctions. It would have been political suicide for him to remain idle in the face of what had happened in Kiev last month. Most Western leaders obviously understood that, even though their rhetoric did not show it. In fact, most if not all Western leaders are probably thanking their lucky stars they have to deal with Mr Putin in the Kremlin and not some die-hard nationalist who would be dreaming of a revival of the former Soviet empire, flexing military muscles with frightening regularity. No-one wants Cold War. So, the so-called \\"smart sanctions,\\" which have been announced by Washington and Brussels in response to events in Crimea were an anti-climax and a confirmation of a total lack of any desire on the part of the West to take the fight with Russia any further. Sure, a bit of posturing and tough talking never hurt the opinion polls at home, but there are more important things than dragging out the dust covered Cold War from the cupboard and losing out on business deals, while having all that lovely Russian money flowing to the West dry up. The Cold War is very 1960s, you know, and no one really wants it to come back. The debate about the legality of the referendum in Crimea will ramble on for a while but it is very difficult to imagine how the result can now be reversed. From the Russian side of the fence, in case you're wondering, the plebiscite in Crimea was a logical response to the overthrow of the democratically elected regime of President Viktor Yanukovych in Kiev -- albeit with its incompetence and corruption -- and the country finding itself with a bunch of opportunists in charge and some pretty rough characters from the far-right acting as their enforcers, saying nasty things about Russia from the word go. No wonder then that Moscow shrugged all accusations that the Crimean referendum was illegal coming from Kiev and the West, saying: \\"Look who's talking!\\" At the moment, all the Kremlin officials and members of parliament mentioned in the lists provided by Washington and Brussels are putting on a brave face and saying that they see it as a privilege and an honor to be in them, pointing out that they don't keep any money or own any assets abroad. Not in their own names they don't, because about a year ago a law had been passed in Russia that no governments officials and members of parliament were allowed to have foreign accounts and own properties abroad. So a transformation of ownership had taken place and it would be pretty hard to figure out who owns what and where. And in case anyone is wondering how then politicians and the servants of the people generally keep their wealth hidden, be it in Russia or in the West, it's all about trusted people, \\"fixers,\\" handling it for them. Yes, yes, don't look surprised, democracy, both regulated and without boundaries, has its own well-tested system. Otherwise why would people go into politics at all? Getting personal. Privately some Russian officials are saying that all these lists represent a break with the old tradition of not getting personal during a row. \\"No one called for smart sanctions against specific yanks and Brits when they pulled off that invasion of Iraq,\\" one angry official in Moscow complained to me. \\"And no one was naming names when the war in Libya went all wrong.\\" Yes, getting personal in politics was always a taboo and this this round boundaries were crossed. So what now? Well, the noises will continue for a while, getting louder when Crimea joins Russia proper. Mind you, the situation may get more complicated if parts of eastern Ukraine start pushing hard for their on referendums on their future with Russia, like the one in Crimea. That is why it's now a good time for both the West and Russia to start finding the way out of this crisis. For everyone's sake. Read more: Putin vs. Obama face off over Crimea facts.

I put all my coins in a piggy bank instead of a coin purse because the","output":"piggy bank provides a more extensive and secure storage solution for long-term accumulation of savings, fostering a sense of financial discipline and responsibility, while also offering various other benefits. One of the primary reasons is that piggy banks tend to have a significantly larger capacity for holding coins than coin purses do. With the added space, individuals can accumulate more coins over a longer period of time, allowing for greater savings without the hassle of constantly emptying a smaller container such as a coin purse. The physical design of piggy banks also encourages money-saving habits. Typically, piggy banks have a small opening or slot through which coins can be inserted, but no easily accessible way to remove the money. Without the temptation of easily withdrawing coins, individuals are more likely to adhere to their savings goals and refrain from frivolously spending their hoarded currency. In contrast, coin purses offer immediate and convenient access to stored coins, enticing users to spend their money on impulse buys and diminishing their overall savings. Additionally, piggy banks can act as decorative accessories in one's living space, serving both a functional and aesthetic purpose. They come in a wide variety of shapes, colors, and materials, allowing them to be incorporated into different design schemes while also staying true to their original purpose as a savings aid. Piggy banks also have a nostalgic appeal for many individuals, as they remind them of their childhood and the early lessons of financial management. This connection to one's formative years can create a positive association with saving and encourage healthy financial habits in the future. Furthermore, piggy banks can serve as an excellent teaching tool for children, helping them understand the concept of saving and instilling the value of delayed gratification at a young age. Having a tangible and enjoyable means of saving coins can make it more likely that children will adopt the practice throughout their lives. Lastly, using a piggy bank can provide an added layer of security that a coin purse may lack. Because piggy banks are commonly kept at home, the chances of losing or misplacing them are significantly reduced compared to carrying a coin purse in a public setting where it can easily be lost or stolen. In conclusion, the choice to store coins in a piggy bank rather than a coin purse allows for greater storage capacity, encourages constructive saving habits and financial discipline, offers a diverse range of designs and nostalgic appeal, serves as an educational tool for children, and provides increased security. All of these factors combine to make piggy banks a preferred method of accumulating and safeguarding one's hard-earned coins."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If you’ve gone the traditional angel route, keep the footwear limited to sandals. If you’re going for a more elegant angel look, make sure your footwear is formal, such as simple slip-on white shoes. The last thing you want to do is have your well-crafted costume thrown off by a pair of sneakers. Summary:","output":"To make your costume special, you can add things from your closet, like a belt, leggings, gloves, or jewelry. You can also visit a store for costume jewelry. Add fun stuff like glitter, paint, or tin foil. Make sure your shoes match your costume, like sandals for a regular angel or fancy shoes for an elegant angel. Don't wear sneakers, or it might look funny."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Options: a ) s . 575 , b ) s . 595 , c ) s . 590 , d ) s . 600 , e ) s . 585 Output:","output":"The task is to solve a multiple-choice question related to financial mathematics, specifically interest calculations. The information given is that an amount of Rs. 420 grew to Rs. 540 in a span of 4 years. The challenge is to determine what this initial amount of Rs. 420 would grow to if the same rate of interest was applied for 6 years instead of 4. The possible answers are presented as 5 choices from 'a' to 'e', given in some unit 's' - presumably a currency. Steps to solve: 1. First, determine the annual interest rate that caused Rs. 420 to become Rs. 540 in 4 years. 2. Then, apply this interest rate to the initial amount of Rs. 420, compound it for 6 years. 3. The resultant will be the sought-after future value after 6 years, which will match one of the options. This can be solved using simple interest formula, but in this simple task, it is not mentioned that we should use simple or compound interest. I will assume that we need to use simple interest. 1. Simple interest formula:     I = P * R * T     Where:      - I is the interest     - P is the principal amount (Rs.420)     - R is the rate of interest per annum     - T is the time in years (4 years)        From the formula, we first need to find the rate R:      Rs. 540 - Rs. 420 = Rs. 120 is the interest for 4 years.      So, R = I / (P * T) = 120 / (420 * 4) = 0.07142857 (which is 7.142857% per annum) 2. Now we know the rate, let's find out how much Rs. 420 will amount to in 6 years.     Using the formula:     I = P * R * T     I = 420 * 0.07142857 * 6 = Rs. 180     So, in 6 years, Rs. 420 will become Rs. 420 + Rs. 180 = Rs. 600 So, the answer is \\"d) s. 600\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We propose a Multi-Layer Network based on the Bayesian framework of the Factor Graphs in Reduced Normal Form (FGrn) applied to a two-dimensional lattice. The Latent Variable Model (LVM) is the basic building block of a quadtree hierarchy built on top of a bottom layer of random variables that represent pixels of an image, a feature map, or more generally a collection of spatially distributed discrete variables. The multi-layer architecture implements a hierarchical data representation that, via belief propagation, can be used for learning and inference. Typical uses are pattern completion, correction and classification. The FGrn paradigm provides great flexibility and modularity and appears as a promising candidate for building deep networks: the system can be easily extended by introducing new and different (in cardinality and in type) variables. Prior knowledge, or supervised information, can be introduced at different scales. The FGrn paradigm provides a handy way for building all kinds of architectures by interconnecting only three types of units: Single Input Single Output (SISO) blocks, Sources and Replicators. The network is designed like a circuit diagram and the belief messages flow bidirectionally in the whole system. The learning algorithms operate only locally within each block. The framework is demonstrated in this paper in a three-layer structure applied to images extracted from a standard data set.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Q&A: Coach Dantonio talks Spartans-Ducks, Connor Cook, Marcus Mariota Mark Dantonio has elevated Michigan State into a powerhouse. The Spartans won 42 games in the previous four seasons, but this week face a huge test, traveling to Oregon to face the Ducks (Saturday, 6:30 p.m. ET, FOX) in what shapes up to be the most compelling non-conference game of the 2014 season. As Dantonio pointed out, his team has won on the road in every stadium in the Big Ten and they have won their last three bowl games, against Georgia, TCU and Stanford. So he knows his players won't be intimidated by the national stage or by the frenzied scene at Autzen Stadium. On Tuesday I sat down with Dantonio to discuss, among other things, his QB Connor Cook's development, Marcus Mariota and carrying the Big Ten's rep on the Spartans’ backs this week. Question: A year ago at this time Connor Cook makes his first road start at Notre Dame and he was a little shaky. How much different, not only is he, but is the offensive identity now going on this first road trip of the year? Dantonio: Well, really, it's probably night and day, we're much more confident in the quarterback situation that is in place. Not only is Connor better because of the experiences that he’s had but Damien Terry is much better, Tyler O’Connor is much better because of another year’s experience. And they’ve had good springs and good summers. So the whole position I think, as a whole is much stronger. But Connor is a very good quarterback, resilient, big guy, great arm, can move. Q: How much were you holding your breath when you saw him take that shot the other night? Dantonio: Yeah, I was a little bit but he got up and sort of hopped off and he was walking. But I was sort of surprised he came back so quickly in that second series. But he’s a tough guy. And I think that speaks to that. He’s a very competitive person and I thought he played very, very well in the entire first half. We just played him the first half. Q: Do you watch the replay of it and kind of wince? Dantonio: Yeah, a little bit. I thought it was a little late and a little low, so. Q: You know how the media works: A lot of us are saying how your brand has been a great defense. Their brand has been fast-pace offense. It's just a fun matchup on that side. How much do you kind of remind everyone here within the program, 'Hey, it's a lot more than just our defense against their offense?' Dantonio: Oh, every day. This is a football team against each other. Special teams are going to have a huge part in this game; our offense against their defense. We’ve got to be able to move the football and obviously control tempo and win possession time, things of that nature, not turning the ball over. So, this is a football game that really I think is a great football matchup and it's going to be very exciting for us. And I want it to be a life experience for our guys really. Q: When Nick Saban was here you guys went over to Autzen (in '98) and played, and they took it to you guys really good. Anything you could take from that experience way back then? Dantonio: Well, it was loud back then but we had some injuries. Amp Campbell went down and had a broken vertebra in his neck. So that was — you know we lost big. And Akili Smith had a big day. That’s what I remember. But that was 1998, a longer period of time. But I guess the thing that I would say right now is we’ve played in some great environments away from home where very few Spartan fans, very loud, a lot of hype, good football teams, and we’ve been able to win. And so this is an opportunity to play on the road, our first road game of the season. So it's a chance for us as a program within our program to gain experience from that. It's a chance for our seniors to lead in the process. And we’re going to have to handle adversity. You know that’s going to happen. And it's just the way that the game is made. So it’ll have all of that in this football game — that’s why it's such a great game. Q: For every week, accountability’s important. Do you speak about it or harp on it any differently this week since you're playing Oregon and things happen even faster with them? Dantonio: Well yeah, I think it's natural that you’re going to see that, 'Hey, if you’re out of your gap, if you’re not doing what you’re supposed to do, they can take advantage of it and it could hurt you in a big way quick.' They’re a very explosive team. Mariota is also a guy who can take a bad play and make a good one. He’s not the guy that’s going to sit back there and dish everything off. He can take it himself. I’ve been very impressed with his leadership because you see it on the film and very impressed with his toughness because you see it on the film. And I think those two attributes makes him even better. I mean he obviously has physical skills. But those two intangibles allow him to really rise above a lot of people. Q: A lot is going to be made about Wisconsin-LSU last week. You guys are carrying, in a lot of people’s eyes, the Big Ten on your back when you go to Autzen. How do you feel about that kind of responsibility? Dantonio: I think that I worry about what I can control to the best of our ability. That’s what we all have to do here. And so I don’t -- there’s pressure. When you play in big games like this, there’s enough pressure you don’t have to put additional pressure on yourself. We understand the aspects of the game relative to our national reputation, I guess. But more importantly, this has been a stepping-stone process for us since coming here in 2007 to be able to get to a game like this with this type of prestige and prominence. And we’ve done that by going to the different places and winning whether it was Nebraska last year or going back to 2010 and winning at Penn State, or whatever we’ve done. Going into environments and winning, creating a process where we’re now being talked about. So we’re going to find out a little bit more about Michigan State and that’s the beauty of all this because I don’t think we’ve ever — it's not an end-all game because, as I said earlier today, we’ve got 10 more other games and we’re destined for failure if we think this is the end-all game either way. But what I’m concerned about or what I’m excited about is our players go in there fresh, go in there anticipating winning and with a lot of energy and making this a life experience. Q: Can [players] get caught up in some peripheral stuff, almost like having an aura about Oregon where they start worrying about (a big play break eventually just coming)? It seems like when Stanford beat them, they kind of did what Stanford did and stayed focused, not worried about, 'Oh my God, some big play is going to happen.' Dantonio: No, we’re going to play. We’ve played a lot of football games here. I think this’ll be our 95th game as a staff here. So along the way we’ve had opportunities to duck opponents. We’ve never ducked and so we’ll do our best in that capacity. But I’m not worried about our players being intimidated, if that’s what you’re asking. You know, it's more about responsibility-driven, tackling in space, playing the ball in the deep part of the field, pressuring the quarterback, things of that nature but our players will be excited to do those things. And on the offensive side of the ball, as we’ve talked about, there’s a whole other aspect of the game coming, so it’ll be an exciting opportunity and I’m looking forward to it. Q: After the way you guys finished last year, you beat a really fast Ohio State team and then you beat a really physical Stanford team. What do you think that did for the guys in here to have that kind of stuff — and not everybody’s on (the 2013) team — but to draw upon when they’re going out to play a top five team? Dantonio: I think we’re a confident football team. I think we believe in our abilities. More importantly, our coaches believe in our players and our players believe in our coaches. And when you have those dynamics working together there’s great chemistry that exists between the coaches and the players and it creates a dynamic that is tough to beat. Q: What are you most curious that you’re going to find out on Saturday? Dantonio: I’m going to find out as the head football coach a little bit more about our players, how they react when they’re hit with adversity and what kind of senior leadership do we have and upper-classman leadership. We have 14 seniors but we have 21 players who are upper-classmen. And I think that’s a lot of leadership in our football team. But at some point in time, you find out about your football team as you go through the season. And I think we’ll find out a little bit more about Michigan State and this year’s team this week. And regardless of what happens we’ll have to regroup, win or lose, take a week off and get ready to play our next game. And at the end of the season is always how we’ve assessed who we are. We’ve never done it at the beginning of the season. We’ve always assessed who we are and what we’ve been able to accomplish at the end of the season. And that’s what we’ll do this year.

Ragan has also released a variety of solo material, including a series of 7-inches on No Idea Records, a live album and three studio albums on Side One Dummy Records.  - Rumbleseat was the acoustic-folk side project of Hot Water Music frontmen Chuck Ragan and Chris Wollard, and Samantha Jones. Formed in 1998, Rumbleseat released four 7\\" records before releasing the full length album, 'Rumbleseat Is Dead', which was released in 2005.  - The New What Next is the sixth full - length studio album by Hot Water Music . It was released by Epitaph in 2004 . This was Hot Water Music 's final release before disbanding in 2006 .  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.  - Hot Water Music is a punk rock band from Gainesville, Florida. The members of the band are Chuck Ragan, Chris Wollard, Jason Black, and George Rebelo. HWM first formed in 1993. In 1998, after releasing multiple EPs and three full-length albums, the band briefly disbanded, but soon reformed, announcing their continuation as Hot Water Music at the concert recorded for \\"Live at the Hardback\\". They are represented by David \\"Beno\\" Benveniste's Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group. In late 2005, Hot Water Music stated they were going on a hiatus following Chuck Ragan's departure. On May 13, 2006 however, the hiatus became seemingly permanent and Hot Water Music officially disbanded. The three remaining members then started a new project, The Draft, whose first album, \\"In a Million Pieces\\", was released on September 12, 2006. Chuck Ragan also continued with a more low-key music career, releasing material through No Idea Records and Side One Dummy Records. He is currently signed to the latter. The band members have also participated in many side projects. The four most popular of these are Blacktop Cadence, Cro(w)s, Unitas and Rumbleseat.  - Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group is an artist development and management company and record label located in West Hollywood, California in the United States. Its current client roster includes AFI, Alice in Chains, Blaqk Audio, Code Orange, Crosses, Deftones, Night Riots, Scars on Broadway, System Of A Down, XTRMST.  - Live at the Hardback is a live recording of what was thought to be Hot Water Music's final show performed in 1999 and one of the last shows performed at The Hardback Cafe, in Florida. HWM announced at the show that they had decided not to break up. The album was released in 1999 by No Idea Records. 'Live At The Hardback' contains songs from the 'Moonpies For Misfits' EP, which was recorded shortly after the release of 'Live At The Hardback'.  - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification.

Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.  - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink.

Please answer a question about the following article about Affirmative action in the United States: Some commentators have defined reverse discrimination as a policy or practice in which members of a majority are discriminated against in favor of a historically disadvantaged group or minority.[non-primary source needed] Many argue that reverse discrimination results from affirmative action policies and that these policies are just another form of discrimination no different from examples in the past. People like Ward Connerly assert that affirmative action requires the very discrimination it is seeking to eliminate. According to these opponents, this contradiction might make affirmative action counter-productive. One argument for reverse discrimination is the idea that affirmative action encourages mediocrity and incompetence. Job positions would not be offered to the applicants who are the most qualified, but to applicants with a special trait such as a certain race, ethnicity, or gender. For example, opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure (see, for example, Richard Sander's study of affirmative action in Law School, bar exam and eventual performance at law firms). Other opponents say that affirmative action lowers the bar and so denies those who strive for excellence on their own merit and the sense of real achievement. Opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions, college, graduate school, etc. An argument against affirmative action is that it encourages what?","output":"An argument against affirmative action is that it encourages mediocrity and incompetence.

Options: - pantry - exhaust pipe - vegetable soup - pot - shopping bags The answer to this question is:","output":"Placing a potato in the exhaust pipe can cause an explosion. The reason behind this is that the exhaust pipe is part of the vehicle's exhaust system, which is responsible for expelling the combustion byproducts (such as gases and fumes) produced by the vehicle's engine. If a potato is placed in the exhaust pipe, it can obstruct the flow of these gases, leading to a buildup of pressure within the exhaust system. This pressure buildup can cause the gases and fumes to accumulate, resulting in a rise in temperature and possibly even a small-scale explosion or damage to the vehicle's engine or exhaust system components. Moreover, the blockage created by the potato may lead to poor engine performance or prevent the engine from starting altogether. On the other hand, placing a potato in any of the other options, (pantry, vegetable soup, pot, or shopping bags) would not cause an explosion. These are all normal places or ways to store, cook, or transport potatoes and do not involve any hazardous risks or situations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

Tampa Bay lost their eighth consecutive meeting at Monster Park, dating to 1980. This game was originally scheduled for 8:15&#160;p.m. on NBC's Sunday Night Football, but on December 10, in accordance with flex-scheduling, the game was moved to the afternoon. Having already clinched a playoff berth, Tampa Bay rested most of their starters in the second half. Despite a late rally, the Buccaneers fell two points short of victory. Tampa Bay controlled most of the first half, capping off their first two drives of the first quarter with field goals by Matt Bryant. On the first play of the second quarter, Shaun Hill connected with Darrell Jackson on a 21-yard touchdown. San Francisco punted on their next drive, and Micheal Spurlock fielded the ball at the 19-yard line. He was tackled and fumbled, while the 49ers recovered. After an instant replay challenge, it was determined that Spurlock was down by contact, and Tampa Bay maintained possession. The drive fizzled though, and ended with a punt. Late in the fourth quarter, Barrett Ruud recovered a 49ers fumble, setting the Buccaneers up on the San Francisco 36-yard line. Four plays later, Jerramy Stevens caught a touchdown pass from Jeff Garcia. Tampa Bay took a 13-7 lead into halftime. On the second-half kickoff, San Francisco recovered a surprise onside kick. The drive came up empty, as they were forced to punt. On Tampa Bay's next possession, however, Luke McCown (who had taken over for the benched Garcia) fumbled and the 49ers recovered at the 14-yard line. In four plays, San Francisco scored a touchdown. Early in the fourth quarter, Nate Clements intercepted a McCown pass, and led to another 49ers touchdown. The 49ers led 21-13, but Tampa Bay still kept hopes alive for a rally. With less than six minutes left in the game, the Buccaneers drove to the 49ers 25-yard line. On 4th down and 6, McCown threw to Michael Clayton for an apparent one-handed touchdown catch, but the ball fell incomplete, and the drive turned over on downs. Tampa Bay managed one final chance to tie the score. Inside the two-minute warning, Tampa Bay drove to the 49ers 24-yard line. McCown rolled out wide to his right, and connected with Stevens for a 24-yard touchdown. McCown then attempted a game-tying two-point conversion. Michael Clayton caught the pass, but one of his feet touched out-of-bounds in the back of the endzone, sealing the game for San Francisco.

Question: What are the number of movable eye coverings do birds have? Context: Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.

Meanwhile, they call the American Nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears. A serial killer, who is listening to their confessions, makes their nightmares come true, killing each one of them in a sadistic way. \\"American Nightmare\\" is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if it were Friday, 13th. Then, the story shifts to a bar, where seven friends are celebrating Halloween. From this moment on, the story has a great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as usual in this type of C production. However, the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse Jane Toppan, giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting. With a better beginning and conclusion, this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie. My vote is four.

Touch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something. A person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys  . The scientists implanted electrodes  --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains. The scientists used the electrode data to identify which neurons had become active. Then the scientists used the implanted electrodes to zap those same neurons. And the monkeys reacted as though their fingers had been touched. In fact, they hadn't. The monkeys couldn't use words to tell the scientists what they had felt. Instead, they communicated by looking in a particular direction--just as when they had really been touched. The new findings show how touch-sensitive devices could be built. The new study also offers \\" a nice clear pathway\\" for figuring out how to restore a sense of touch to an amputee  or someone with a injury of spinal cord. The study shows how artificial limbs might be connected to the brain so that a person can \\"feel\\" with... Question: Monkeys tell researchers their sense of touch by   _  .

How you can get stuck in jail without being guilty \\"Prior to this reform [bail] was certainly more flawed than good,\\" said Paul Prestia, the attorney who handled Browder's case. \\"The bail system serves a purpose, but it's skewed. Families who are disadvantaged are going to have a much more difficult time obtaining bail.\\" When asked if they would be able to afford a hypothetical emergency expense costing 400, such as bail money for a family member, only 47 percent of Americans said that they would be able to pay without selling something or borrowing money, according to the Federal Reserve's most recent data. \\"If the family doesn't have the bail amount handy at the arraignment, within minutes the defendant could be on a bus to Rikers,\\" Prestia said. \\"Then the process to take them home [after posting bail] could take days.\\" Cash bail amounts, intended to be insurance that someone arrested for a crime will show up for their court date, can become a problem when defendants who are unable to pay must wait in jail for their court date, often resulting in job loss and financial strain. Read MoreObama administration wants to give prisoners Pell grants The almost 18 million supervised release program in New York City will be an expansion of pilot projects in the boroughs of Queens and Manhattan, and will let 3,000 eligible defendants remain at home with their families and continue working while waiting for trial, the mayor's office said. In the Queens pilot, 87 percent of the people being supervised in the project returned to court without using cash bail. At Rikers Island, 40 percent of detainees are there because they can't afford to make bail, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union, which testified before the New York City Council to advocate abolishing cash bail. The average cost of keeping someone in jail while they wait for trial is approximately 19,000 per defendant, compared with averages ranging from 3,100 to 4,600 for alternatives like community supervision, depending on the person's risk level, according to research sponsored by the Department of Justice. In addition to housing costs to taxpayers, waiting in jail can be costly for defendants. Spending sometimes months in jail before their court dates, defendants can lose their jobs from missing work, said Nancy Fishman, project director at the Vera Institute of Justice, causing a spiral effect for families as missed payments for things like mortgages, cars and child support begin to add up. \\"We're talking about people who don't have jobs where they can just say 'Hey I'm not going to be in for a few weeks, can I still have my job when I get back?'\\" said Fishman. Aside from financial effects, being held in jail—even for a short time—has effects on future behaviors, according to the Vera institute's report Incarceration's Front Door: The Misuse of Jails in America. Compared to defendants who were held for no more than 24 hours, those held for eight to 14 days were 51 percent more likely to go back to jail for another crime after sentence completion. Jails are a gateway into the criminal justice system, Fishman said.
