Information:  - White blood cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes or leucocytes, are the cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. All white blood cells are produced and derived from multipotent cells in the bone marrow known as hematopoietic stem cells. Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the blood and lymphatic system.  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear...  - Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce. Infectious disease, also known as transmissible disease or communicable disease, is illness resulting from an infection. Infections are caused by infectious agents including viruses, viroids, prions, bacteria, nematodes such as parasitic roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms and other helminths.  - Neutropenia or neutropaenia, is an abnormally low concentration of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood. Neutrophils make up the majority of circulating white blood cells and serve as the primary defense against infections by destroying bacteria, bacterial fragments and immunoglobulin-bound viruses in the blood. Patients with neutropenia are more susceptible to bacterial infections and, without prompt medical attention, the condition may become life-threatening (neutropenic sepsis).  - Splenomegaly is an enlargement of the spleen. The spleen usually lies in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the human abdomen. Splenomegaly is one of the four cardinal signs of \\"hypersplenism\\" which include; some reduction in the number of circulating blood cells affecting granulocytes, erythrocytes or platelets in any combination, a compensatory proliferative response in the bone marrow, and the potential for correction of these abnormalities by splenectomy. Splenomegaly is usually associated with increased workload (such as in hemolytic anemias), which suggests that it is a response to hyperfunction. It is therefore not surprising that splenomegaly is associated with any disease process that involves abnormal red blood cells being destroyed in the spleen. Other common causes include congestion due to portal hypertension and infiltration by leukemias and lymphomas. Thus, the finding of an enlarged spleen, along with caput medusa, is an important sign of portal hypertension.  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - Felty 's syndrome , also called Felty syndrome , is characterized by the combination of rheumatoid arthritis , splenomegaly and neutropenia . The condition is more common in those aged 50 -- 70 years , and is more prevalent in females than males and more in Caucasians than blacks . It is a deforming but inactive disease and seropositive for RF .  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed...

Title: \\"Disappointment at the Box Office: A Review of 'False Promises'\\" As I settled into my seat, I was filled with excitement and anticipation, expecting my cinematic experience to be nothing short of extraordinary. However, within the first half hour of 'False Promises', that excitement quickly dissipated into a whirlpool of disappointment and frustration.  Step 1: Addressing the storyline The movie's premise was intriguing initially, as it revolved around a group of friends who embark on a perilous journey to uncover a hidden treasure. The potential was certainly there, but the poor execution and lack of cohesive storytelling led to a disjointed narrative. With an underdeveloped plot, the movie left audiences questioning the characters' motivations and wondering why certain events occurred. Step 2: Analyzing the characters and acting When it comes to the characters, the film fell short on many fronts. Not only were the characters themselves shallow and one-dimensional, but the acting appeared strained and failed to stir any genuine emotions. The friendships displayed in the movie were unconvincing, which is a major setback given that the plot heavily relies on the bond between these characters. Step 3: Critiquing the dialogue The dialogue found within 'False Promises' was another aspect that left much to be desired. Clichéd expressions and forced humor were abundant, leaving the movie devoid of any distinct personality. Instead of immersing audiences in a captivating tale, the dialogue detracted from the overall experience, as ticket holders found themselves cringing at the strained attempts at comedy and wit. Step 4: Assessing the production and visuals Despite the impressive visuals and special effects, these elements alone could not save the movie or mitigate the glaring issues with the story, acting, and dialogue. High-quality visuals should complement a strong narrative, but sadly in 'False Promises', the beautiful imagery served only as a hollow shell, incapable of disguising the film's inadequacies. Step 5: Drawing a conclusion Overall, the excitement and anticipation that I felt before watching 'False Promises' were not even remotely met. Hindered by a disjointed plot, poor character development, and subpar acting, even the enthralling special effects couldn't salvage this film. In the end, what held the promise of a thrilling adventure turned out to be an exhausting disappointment. With these steps, I have written a negative movie review, addressing the key aspects that contributed to the overall disappointment of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A \\"pair\\" is when a batsman fails to score any runs and is dismissed for a duck, which is zero runs, in both innings of a match. However, there's a subtle distinction when a \\"king pair\\" comes into the picture. A \\"king pair\\" specifically refers to a batsman being dismissed on the first ball he faces, in both innings of a match. It's important to note that cricket matches usually take place in different formats, such as Test matches, One-day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) games. Test matches are played over several days and include two innings for each team, while ODIs and T20s are both limited-overs formats with only one innings per team. The concept of a \\"pair\\" or \\"king pair\\" is therefore most relevant to Test matches, where a team bats twice in a single game. Achieving a \\"pair\\" or \\"king pair\\" is highly undesirable, and a batsman always aims to avoid this situation since it reflects poorly on their performance and contribution to the team's total score. Batsmen who experience a pair or king pair in a match need to regroup mentally and work on their batting technique and strategy to avoid such instances in future games. In the history of cricket, only a few players have had the misfortune of getting a king pair in Test matches. This rare occurrence has led to increased emphasis on developing strong mental resilience and meticulous preparation among top-level cricketers, in addition to refining batting skills and techniques. In summary, the term used to describe the situation when a batsman is \\"out\\" from the first ball in both innings of a cricket match is called a \\"pair\\" or \\"king pair.\\" This occurrence is quite rare and signifies an unfavorable performance by the batsman. It highlights the importance of mental preparedness, strategic planning, and skill development for batsmen to excel in the competitive world of cricket."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: The English language is the language of the United States. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"From the given sentence, \\"The English language is the language of the United States,\\" several pieces of data can be extracted to provide insight into the relationship between the English language and the United States. Some of these data points include: 1. Official Language: The sentence suggests that the English language holds an official or dominant status within the United States. It implies that English is the primary language used for communication, education, government affairs, business, and other areas of public life in the country. However, it is worth noting that the United States does not have an official language at the federal level, although English serves as the de facto official language. 2. Historical background: The sentence reflects the historical influence of British colonization in North America. The British settlers brought the English language with them to the New World, and it gradually became the dominant language as more English-speaking settlers arrived. The sentence highlights the colonial roots of the American-English-speaking population. 3. Linguistic relationship: The sentence implies a linguistic relationship between the United States and other English-speaking countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The presence of the English language in the United States contributes to the shared linguistic and cultural heritage among these nations, which has fostered cooperation and exchange over time. 4. Demographics: The statement points to the fact that a significant portion of the United States population speaks English. According to recent data, approximately 78% of US residents speak English only, while more than 96% can speak English fluently, either as their first or second language. 5. Multilingualism and language diversity: While the sentence emphasizes the importance of the English language in the United States, it does not discount the presence and relevance of other languages spoken within the country. The United States is a linguistically diverse nation, with a substantial number of bilingual or multilingual speakers. Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, French, Korean, and Arabic are some of the widely spoken languages in the US, apart from English. 6. American English: The statement indirectly highlights the existence of American English, a dialect of the English language that has evolved within the United States. American English differs from British and other English dialects in terms of pronunciation, vocabulary, spelling, grammar, and idiomatic usage, which illustrates the impact of regional evolution and geo-cultural influences on language. 7. Language in education and media: Given that English is the language of the United States, it is used extensively in the education system and mass media. Most schools, universities, and other educational institutions in the United States conduct classes in English, and it is the primary mode of instruction. Newspapers, television programs, radio stations, movies, and other forms of media are predominantly in English as well. In summary, the sentence \\"The English language is the language of the United States\\" provides data on several aspects of the relationship between English and the United States, including the history, linguistic connections with other countries, demographics, language diversity, development of American English, and the use of English in various spheres of society."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: It is getting hard to count how many times Miley Cyrus has stripped down for photo shoots — but the 22-year-old’s latest spread is her most provocative yet.      Cyrus covers this month’s issue of Candy magazine, the first magazine “completely dedicated to celebrating tranvestism, transexuality, crossdressing and androgyny in all their glory.”      In a series of photos taken by renowned celebrity photographer (and alleged sex predator) Terry Richardson, Cyrus playfully fellates a nightstick while donning a policeman’s cap, stretches out her tongue to lick her armpit hair and bends at the waist to reach for a sex toy.      “Miley has what it takes,” the caption on each shot reads.      Check out the complete unblurred photo shoot here (Warning: Photos are extremely NSFW).      This isn’t the first time Cyrus has gotten naked for Richardson; the controversial photographer shot a younger Cyrus in his New York studio in 2013. The pair also worked together on Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball” music video.      Richardson, who’s worked with countless celebrities on sexy photo shoots, has become something of an outcast in the photography world in recent years. Last year, a model named Emma Appleton accused the photographer of soliciting sex from her in exchange for securing her a Vogue photo shoot. In December 2013, Richardson’s ex-girlfriend, Audrey Gelman, said that both she and Lena Dunham, who had been photographed by Richardson, “have regrets.”      Last year, Vogue told Us Weekly it had “no plans to work with” its controversial former contributor in the future. ||||| “Beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless, woman.”      That’s how Amy Schumer described her nude photo by Annie Leibovitz for the new Pirelli Calendar, seizing the words from the tweets and thinkpieces by her critics and cheerleaders, all of whom will reliably bicker over the headline-making photo shoot from the star, who has turned the unapologetic, self-deprecating embracing of her body image into a zeitgeist-seizing art form.      In the photo, Schumer is nude with nothing but a pair of underwear and some heels on, her arms opting to conceal her nipples instead of the rolls on her stomach as she slouches, and holding a coffee cup as the flash of a bulb startles her face startles into a candid, quite beautiful pose.      The Trainwreck and Inside Amy Schumer star is a model for photographer Annie Leibovitz’s “quite different” 43rd edition of the Pirelli Calendar, typically known for classic pin-up poses from the world’s most glamorous and flawless sex symbols—Naomi Campbell, Penelope Cruz, Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford—but which this year features some of the world’s most distinguished women, all noted for things other than, but also including, their looks.      “The goal was to be very straightforward,” Leibovitz said in a press conference unveiling the images. “I wanted the pictures to show the women exactly as they are, with no pretense.”      In addition to Schumer, other models for the calendar include names not classically associated with the phrase “pin-up”—Selma director Ava DuVernay; Yao Chen, the first Chinese goodwill ambassador for United Nations High Commission for Refugees; tennis phenom Serena Williams—and therefore reappropriates the phrase to encompass new layers of sexiness and beauty: the kind that triumphs confidence, intelligence, class, and strength as part of the idea of exhibitionism.      The remainder of the calendar’s models include Lucasfilm producer Kathleen Kennedy, Yoko Ono, writer Fran Lebowitz, executive Mellody Hobson, former supermodel Natalia Vodianova, philanthropist Agnes Gund, blogger Tavi Gevinson, and Iranian artist Shirin Neshat.      As for her own image, which bucks the celebrity tradition of airbrushing out curves and rolls, Schumer says, “I never felt more beautiful.”      The more radical message she's sending: We’re all our fiercest champions, but we're also our biggest critics. That tension? That is natural. That is beautiful.      It’s easy to sound trite or maybe even patronizing when praising a famous person for embracing their body, and for being candid about all the insecurities they still acknowledge. But to deny the power not just in Schumer’s involvement in this calendar but also in the way she has shared the photo would be an injustice to the effect it will undeniably have.      “Beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless, woman,” she captioned the photo when she posted it on Twitter and on Instagram Monday morning.      These are words that seem in contradiction with each other, almost like an insufferable beat poet who thinks she is being deeper than she is. But they’re not. Schumer is redirecting the body-positive movement in a more realistic, and maybe even emotionally healthier way.      Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

And you can also hate your body sometimes, too.      Because to have a relationship with your body and your self-confidence means being honest about insecurities and your feelings about them. Otherwise you’re just projecting a false pride, convincing yourself that you’ve accepted parts of your body that you don’t like merely because a body-positive movement says you will be happier if you do.      Schumer has always been candid about her body image, partly because she recognizes the radical power of being a successful and sexual woman in Hollywood while not having the body type of a waifish clothing rack with cartoon boobs. With great power comes great responsibility, and if not necessarily considering it a responsibility to discuss her body image struggles (because, dear God, how awful), she considers it an opportunity, and one that she’s relished.      But she’s also been candid because we’ve forced her to. How many interviews has Schumer sat through, forced to answer questions about being a “trailblazer” because she’s carved a place for herself in show business without being a size zero?      The brilliant comedian that she is, she’s used it as part of her comedy, especially in an often repeated bit about how in L.A. her arms register as legs. (It’s a good bit, even if we’ve heard her perform it so often by this point we could recite it ourselves.)      The eloquent human that she is—the one who has been so incomparably gifted at channeling our own frustrations and complicated feelings with a razor-sharp wit laced with surprising shocks of emotion—she’s also used this candor to be more authentic than most celebrities have ever been about what it’s been like to be insecure with your body while under the scrutinizing gaze of the public eye. And then eventually conquer that.      “Some nights I just didn’t even want to go on stage because I couldn’t find an outfit I looked good in,” she said on the Today show last month. Then, tearfully, “It’s been a struggle for me my whole life, especially just being in the entertainment industry, standing on a stage in front of people. I can’t perform my best or be confident if I’m not sure if I’m pulling at something. Sometimes I would just want to throw in the towel and say, ‘I’m not going to do stand-up tonight.’”      We don’t often let our strong role models to have chink in their armor, especially ones that betray any sort of emotion or vulnerability. Amy Schumer, role model for all confident women, called bullshit on that, and we’re all better for it.      So it’s with a careful honed grace, sharpened from so much of that, that Schumer shares the photo with the perfect message, a collection of words that some will use to describe how she looks, that she will use to describe her looks as her relationship to the photo and her body evolves (like all of us do with our own), and that actually mean something real—more real than any rote “This is beautiful!” plastic endorsement.      Perhaps unintentionally, there’s a bit of cheeky poeticism to this photo being included as part of the Pirelli Calendar, which is routinely associated with “pin-up” poses.      In an episode of Inside Amy Schumer that spoofed 12 Angry Men, jurors did not debate whether the defendant (played by Schumer) was guilty of committing murder, but instead the crime of not being hot enough to be on TV. At one point, one of the jurors bemoans the end of the days where only women as sexy and perfect as Marilyn Monroe—the iconic pin-up girl—were allowed on TV.      Monroe was a size 8, another juror points out. Schumer is a size 6.      A beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless size 6. ||||| Annie Leibovitz opts for natural and effortless style in portraits of Serena Williams, Yoko Ono, Amy Schumer and others      Pirelli calendar goes with less steam and more jokes for 2016      The annual calendar produced by Pirelli tyres – which traditionally centres on the artfully lit nude bodies of female supermodels – has been unveiled, presenting a dramatic shift in subject matter and aesthetic.      Gone are the gym-toned limbs and heaving bosoms; in their place for the 2016 calendar, shot by Annie Leibovitz, are simple portraits of women of various sizes, ages and ethnicities chosen for their “professional, social, cultural, sporting and artistic accomplishment”.      Quick guide A brief history of the Pirelli calendar Show Hide What is it? The Pirelli calendar was first published in 1963 as a corporate gift for clients and customers of the Italian tyre company. The annual publication of the calendar – which has traditionally featured conventionally sexy images of nude women – has become an unlikely fixture on the fashion calendar because it attracts big-name photographers, models and celebrities. Its blatant objectification of naked women has been controversial and at times obtuse, but the calendar has survived by becoming more diverse and inclusive in its approach and its subject matter. Who has shot for it? ​The original photographer was Terence Donovan, who was tasked with producing an arty, tasteful reimagining of the traditional car mechanics' workshop pin-up calendar. ​He returned in 1987. Other notable names include Brian Duffy (1965), Sarah Moon (1972), Norman Parkinson (1985), Bert Stern (1986), Richard Avedon (1995, 1997), Peter Lindbergh (1996, 2002, 2014, 2017), Annie Leibowitz (2000, 2016), Mario Testino (2001), Terry Richardson (2010), Steve McCurry (2013), Helmut Newton (2014), Steven Meisel (2015) and Tim Walker (2018). What about the models? The models have often taken second billing to the photographers, although there have been plenty of big names. Naomi Campbell featured in 1987, and the calendar tapped into the cult of the supermodel from 1994 when Herb Ritts shot Helena Christensen, Cindy Crawford, Karen Alexander and Kate Moss. Steven Meisel's 2015 edition was a who's who of the biggest names in modelling including Gigi Hadid, Karen Elson and Joan Smalls.      How has the calendar moved with the times? In 2007, Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin took inspiration from Hollywood by featuring Penélope Cruz, Lou Doillon, Hilary Swank, Naomi Watts and a 71 year-old Sophia Loren. Peter Beard's 2009 calendar highlighted social activism. It was shot in Rio de Janeiro, using a mix of models and city residents – all clothed – who had started their own charities. Annie Leibowitz's 2016 calendar featured women who have achieved something significant in their fields, including Yoko Ono, Patti Smith, Serena Williams and Amy Schumer. Tim Walker's Alice in Wonderland calendar for 2018, styled by Vogue editor Edward Enninful, was the first to star an all-black cast, including Whoopi Goldberg, Puff Daddy, Naomi Campbell and RuPaul.      Subjects include Yoko Ono, wearing a top hat, tuxedo jacket and fishnet tights; and Patti Smith, modelling jeans, boots and a snarl. The cultural commentator Fran Lebowitz makes an unlikely Miss May, smoking a cigarette in a man’s oversized pinstriped jacket. The blogger Tavi Gevinson, Chinese actor Yao Chen, artist Shirin Neshat, investment banker Mellody Hobson, the director of the film Selma, Ava DuVernay, and Agnes Gund, an art collector, also appear.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Serena Williams in the 2016 calendar. Photograph: Annie Leibovitz/Pirelli      The tennis star Serena Williams was one of just two scantily clad stars, posing in a balletic lunge with her muscular, naked back to the camera. December’s subject, the comedian Amy Schumer, sips from a lipstick-stained takeaway coffee cup in her underwear, with soft rolls of flesh visible on her stomach.      At the launch of the calendar on Monday, Leibovitz explained that none of these photographs had been conceived with the male gaze in mind. Williams’s photo was “not a nude but a body study”, she said, while Schumer’s was a comic conceit: “The idea was that she was the only one who had not got the memo about wearing clothes.”      To the uninitiated, the Pirelli calendar might sound like a tatty document destined for mechanics to stare at in a garage. But during its 50-odd years of production, Pirelli has worked hard to cultivate a sense of artiness and exclusivity around the images. In its hard copy form the calendar is only sent out to a select and secret few, although the images circulate widely on the internet.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Annie Leibovitz attends the Pirelli calendar launch in London. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA      They are given a veneer of respectability, and fashion industry approval, thanks to the inclusion of the world’s top supermodels and actors – Kate Moss, Gisele Bundchen and Julianne Moore to name a few – who are photographed by illustrious names including Herb Ritts, Richard Avedon and Helmut Newton.      Monday’s slick launch event, in the grand ballroom of the Grosvenor House on Park Lane, London, underlined the seriousness with which Pirelli takes the calendar as a marketing exercise. The world’s media gathered for the unveiling of the images, listening as Clare Balding interviewed Leibovitz and three of the calendar’s subjects – Gevinson, Gund and Chen – on stage, while the proceedings were translated via headsets into four languages.      The women spoke warmly of the calendar’s symbolism, with Leibovitz describing it as representative of a shift in the way women are viewed. The tyre manufacturer’s chief executive, Marco Tronchetti Provera, said the company had been looking to make a departure from the usual format of its calendar this year, one that felt “very timely”.      “Women who have done something outstanding in their lives, from every corner of the world. This represents what Pirelli thinks is beautiful,” said Tronchetti Provera.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Yao Chen, the Chinese actor, in the calendar. Photograph: Annie Leibovitz/Pirelli      Leibovitz added that the images were designed to look as natural and effortless as possible, with little “pretence” to the pictures. Though shot in flattering black and white, they had been subject to just a “little cleaning up” of the images rather than the usual heavy post-production work, she said.      Though Leibovitz, who also photographed a calendar of nudes for Pirelli in 2000, declined to describe the calendar as a feminist watershed moment for the brand, she said: “Pirelli has always given free rein to the photographer, so it’s really about choice of photographer. I think the company has wanted to shift for a few years and my mandate was that they wanted to see some change.”      During a behind-the-scenes film shown at the launch, the photographer’s almost-namesake Lebowitz offered a slightly different analysis: “Perhaps clothed women are going to have a moment.” ||||| Annie Leibovitz/Pirelli      For more than half a century, Italian tire-maker Pirelli has released an annual calendar full of photos of supermodels in pin-up poses wearing skimpy lingerie or nothing at all. This year’s iteration marks a drastic departure from the form: The calendar’s models are luminaries of art, business, sports, and philanthropy, photographed by Annie Leibovitz.      Christina Cauterucci Christina Cauterucci is a Slate staff writer.            In fact, the only two women who appear in partial nudity are Amy Schumer and Serena Williams, who’ve each been targeted by body-shamers over the past year. Their gorgeous images do more to turn that shame around on their trolls than any Instagram comment war ever could.      Advertisement            Yoko Ono, Ava DuVernay, Iranian artist Shirin Neshat, Patti Smith, author Fran Lebowitz, actress Yao Chen, and Tavi Gevinson show up in the calendar, too. “I wanted the pictures to show the women exactly as they are, with no pretense,” Leibovitz told Vogue of the studio portraits. The calendar isn’t for sale; as in past years, it’ll be gifted to 20,000 “VIPs, musicians, politicians, and royalty.”      The nudity of Williams and Schumer stands in stark contrast to Pirelli’s usual M.O. Previous decades have seen the world’s top professional beauties showcasing individual exposed, oiled-up body parts—with their faces, at times, cropped out—in what amounted to a fancified soft-core porn magazine. Last year’s featured women, which included lingerie models Adriana Lima, Joan Smalls, and Gigi Hadid, were shot swaddled in latex straddling bike seats and bathing in bubbles. Flip through the past 50 years of calendars and you’ll find just a few years of clothed women in editorial-type shoots. Taken as a whole, the archive testifies to the longtime persistence of one particular beauty ideal in fashion and mainstream media, one that can rarely accommodate a roll of fat, bulge of muscle, or pinch of age-spotted skin.      Annie Leibovitz/Pirelli      Now, Pirelli seems to realize, the world has gotten bored of this tired tradition. “A white, able-bodied cis-gendered woman being naked is just not revolutionary anymore,” Gevinson told the New York Times. “I don’t think anyone is going to be like, ‘Damn, I wanted those naked chicks.’ ” The calendar’s two naked chicks, Williams and Schumer, are the perfect step away from Pirelli’s nudity of yore.      In any state of dress or undress, Schumer and Williams have been scrutinized for their looks, and both have resisted pressure to retreat into more modest clothing or a different strength-training regimen. Schumer has parodied her trolls’ ridiculous fixation on her looks and doubled down on her overtly sexual image. Williams, whose “large biceps” and “mold-breaking muscular frame” have been pondered over nearly as much as her athletic prowess, has batted down claims that her body shape makes her less feminine. (“First of all she’s a woman, and she wants to be a woman,” coach Tomasz Wiktorowski has said of his strategy to keep tennis player Agnieszka Radwanska small and lean.) In a Good Morning America interview, Williams praised her own body’s athletic form. “I love that I am a full woman and I’m strong and I’m powerful and I’m beautiful at the same time,” she said. ||||| Summary:","output":"Miley Cyrus has once again stripped for a provocative photo shoot, this time for an issue of Candy magazine, which is the first magazine completely dedicated to transvestism, transexuality, cross-dressing and androgyny.

Quidditch teams consist of seven players: three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker.  1. Chasers: Their primary responsibility is to score goals by throwing the Quaffle (a ball used in Quidditch) through one of the opponent's three hoops. Each goal is worth ten points. 2. Beaters: They use small, enchanted bats to hit Bludgers (dangerous balls) towards opposing players to disrupt their gameplay and protect their teammates from potential harm. 3. Keeper: Their role is to defend the team's three hoops and prevent the opposing team's Chasers from scoring goals by blocking the Quaffle. 4. Seeker: Their primary objective is to catch the Golden Snitch, a small, fast flying ball that, when caught, awards the team 150 points and usually ends the game.

They are the Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary. According to convention, when the Prime Minister names his or her Cabinet, either after a general election or a mid-term reshuffle, the first Cabinet ministers to be announced are the Chancellor, the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary.  - Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, normally referred to as the Home Secretary, is a senior official as one of the Great Offices of State within Her Majesty's Government and head of the Home Office. The office is a British Cabinet level position.  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - Leonard James \\"Jim\\" Callaghan, Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, (27 March 1912  26 March 2005) was a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1976 to 1979 and the Leader of the Labour Party from 1976 to 1980. Callaghan is to date the only politician in history to have served in all four of the \\"Great Offices of State\\", having been Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1964 to 1967, Home Secretary from 1967 to 1970, and Foreign Secretary from 1974, until his appointment as Prime Minister in 1976. As Prime Minister, he had some successes, but was chiefly remembered for the \\"Winter of Discontent\\" in 197879. During a very cold winter, his battle with trade unions led to massive strikes that seriously inconvenienced the public, leading to his defeat in the polls by Margaret Thatcher.  - Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, (13 October 1925  8 April 2013) was a British stateswoman who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and the Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century, and the first woman to have held the office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady, a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism.  - The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. The prime minister (informal abbreviation: PM) and Cabinet (consisting of all the most senior ministers, most of whom are government department heads) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the Monarch, to Parliament, to their political party and ultimately to the electorate. The office is one of the Great Offices of State. The , Theresa May, leader of the Conservative Party, was appointed by the Queen on 13 July 2016.  - The United Kingdom general election of 1979 was held on 3 May 1979 to elect 635 members to the British House of Commons . The Conservative Party , led by Margaret Thatcher ousted the incumbent Labour government of James Callaghan with a parliamentary majority of 44 seats . The election was the first of four consecutive election victories for the Conservative Party , and Thatcher became the United Kingdom 's and Europe 's first female head of government . The previous parliamentary term had begun in October 1974 , when Harold Wilson led Labour to a majority of three seats , but within 18 months he had resigned as prime minister to be succeeded by James Callaghan , and within a year the government 's narrow parliamentary majority had gone . Callaghan had made agreements with the Liberals , the Ulster Unionists , as well as the Scottish and Welsh nationalists in order to remain in power . However , on 28 March 1979 following the defeat of the Scottish devolution referendum , Thatcher tabled a motion of no confidence in James Callaghan 's Labour government , which was passed by just one vote ( 311 to 310 ) , triggering a general election five months before the end of the government 's term . The Labour campaign was hampered by the series of industrial disputes and strikes during the Winter of 1978 - 79 , known as the Winter of Discontent and the party focused its campaign on support for the National Health Service and full employment . After intense media speculation , Callaghan had announced early in the autumn of 1978 that a general election would not take place that year having received private polling data which suggested a parliamentary majority was unlikely . The Conservative campaign employed the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi and pledged to control inflation as well as curbing the power of the trade unions . The Liberal Party was damaged by allegations that its former leader Jeremy Thorpe had been involved in a homosexual affair , and had conspired to murder his former lover . The Liberals were now...  - Thatcherism describes the conviction politics, economic, social policy and political style of the British Conservative Party politician Margaret Thatcher, who was leader of her party from 1975 to 1990. It has also been used to describe the beliefs of the British government under Thatcher as Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990, and beyond into the governments of John Major, Tony Blair and David Cameron. An exponent or supporter of Thatcherism is regarded as a Thatcherite.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.  - The Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of Her Majesty's Exchequer, commonly known as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a senior official within the Government of the United Kingdom and head of Her Majesty's Treasury. The office is a British Cabinet-level position.

Q: when was antisocial personality disorder added to the dsm? A:","output":"A: Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) was first included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in its third edition, published in 1980. However, to understand the full context behind the inclusion of ASPD in the DSM, it's crucial to delve into the history and evolution of diagnostic criteria for personality disorders.  The concept of a personality disorder related to antisocial behavior can be traced back to the early 19th century when philosophers and psychiatrists began studying deviant human behavior. By the 20th century, the term \\"psychopath\\" started to emerge as a way to describe someone who displayed persistent antisocial behavior. The first edition of the DSM, published in 1952, did not feature a specific diagnostic category for ASPD, but it did include a classification called \\"sociopathic personality disturbance,\\" which described individuals showcasing antisocial behavior. The second edition of the DSM, which came out in 1968, maintained the classification of a personality disorder related to antisocial traits and renamed it \\"Personality Disorder, Antisocial Type.\\" It was not until the publication of the third edition of the DSM in 1980 that the term \\"Antisocial Personality Disorder\\" was officially introduced. This edition aimed to improve the clarity, reliability, and validity of the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders, and ASPD was described as a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. Criteria for diagnosing ASPD in the DSM-III included several antisocial behaviors that started since the age of 15, as well as evidence of Conduct Disorder before the age of 15. The subsequent DSM editions (DSM-IV in 1994 and DSM-5 in 2013) have retained the general diagnostic criteria for ASPD with minor modifications. The DSM-5 has maintained the focus on the presence of a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of others' rights, with a combination of various behavioral, interpersonal, and affective criteria. In conclusion, Antisocial Personality Disorder was officially added to the DSM in 1980 with the publication of the third edition. However, the path to its inclusion began much earlier, with evolving understanding and classifications of antisocial behavior-related personality disorders throughout the history of the DSM."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: James' father unfortunately had Huntington's disease. This is a disease that can be passed down from generation to generation. His mother Got cancer at one point but it has been treated and has been eliminated.  Given Huntington;s disease can be passed down, is it a mutation in phenotype or body cells?  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. A:","output":"Given the information provided, Huntington's disease is a mutation in the germline cells, not in the somatic cells or body cells. Huntington's disease is a hereditary condition that can be passed down from one generation to the next. This means that the genetic mutation responsible for the disease occurs in the DNA of sex cells (or gametes), which are the germline cells.  As the germline cells undergo meiosis and eventually form the zygote in sexual reproduction, the mutation in the DNA is passed on and inherited by the offspring. In the case of James' father, since he had Huntington's disease, this germline mutation would potentially be passed on to James and the risk of developing the disease increases for him. On the other hand, James' mother's cancer, which is now eliminated, is most likely a somatic mutation. Somatic mutations occur in body cells and do not get passed down to offspring since they are not present in the germline cells. These mutations, if harmful, can lead to conditions like cancer but have no direct hereditary implications for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge.

Sent 2: KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Ladin considered the basic idea feasible. Sent 3: Bin Ladin, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. Sent 4: These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. Sent 5: According to KSM, Bin Ladin wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. Sent 6: No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Sent 7: Bin Ladin also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. Sent 8: During the al Matar meetings, Bin Ladin told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. Sent 9: KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. Sent 10: KSM had not met them. Sent 11: His only guidance from Bin Ladin was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Sent 12: Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca.

I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina.

In the motel archive, Alice stumbles upon the name Perry Smith, who was a mere teenager at the time of the murders. Act 2: Through vigorous investigation, Alice learns that Perry had multiple run-ins with the law, but nothing ever tied him to the Haverford case. Alice discovers that Perry is now serving a lifelong sentence in a high-security prison for a series of other murders. However, Perry has never spoken about any of his past crimes. Act 3: Alice starts visiting Perry in prison, gradually gaining his trust. Simultaneously, she works outside the prison, chasing elusive leads and re-interviewing witnesses. A breakthrough occurs when Alice uncovers evidence of a secret romantic affair between Perry and Irene Haverford, the eldest Haverford daughter, just before the murders took place. Act 4: In prison, Alice presses Perry harder on his involvement in the Haverford case. Perry's emotions finally crack, and he starts to reveal details, confessing to having acted impulsively in a fit of rage after a heated confrontation. Perry explains his intent to protect Irene from her family's overbearing nature and control.

Question: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. After the end of this story, Rialto Bridge's is probably:  A. still new  B. In need of renovations  C. An historical landmark  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"C. An historical landmark The Rialto Bridge, or Ponte di Rialto, has a rich history that dates back to the 12th century. Initially a pontoon bridge, it was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. After several instances of collapse and destruction, it became clear that a more permanent and durable solution was needed. In the late 16th century, Antonio da Ponte's design for a single-arch stone bridge was chosen, and the bridge was completed in 1591. Throughout the years, the Rialto Bridge has become an iconic symbol of Venice and a major tourist destination. Its unique design, which allows boats to pass underneath and incorporates shops atop the bridge, is a perfect representation of the ingenuity and beauty of Venetian architecture. The bridge's historical significance and enduring presence make it a clear choice as an historical landmark. However, it is essential to note that historical landmarks might require maintenance and occasional renovations to ensure their preservation for future generations. So, even though the Rialto Bridge is an historical landmark, it may still need attention and care to maintain its status as one of the most iconic symbols of Venice and its rich, unique history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I don't doubt the caliper's accuracy, but I've tried measuring myself over and over and the values I get vary by as much as 15 mm. The instruction manual that it brings is far too basic and does not give a clear understanding of how to take measurements. I believe there are manuals for sale that are supposed to help you get consistent values, but I don't own one myself. Without such a manual, I would advise you to spend your money elsewhere.

If the day ends and there is no sunlight, the process will be affected directly as well as indirectly. 1. Direct effect: Sunlight is the primary energy source heating up the greenhouse. Without it, the greenhouse's internal temperature will begin to drop, as there will be no incoming solar radiation to be converted into heat. 2. Indirect effect: The absence of sunlight can also affect the temperature distribution inside the greenhouse. During the day, warmer air rises to the top, while cooler air is pushed to the bottom, creating air circulation. When there is no sunlight, this circulation may be disrupted as the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the greenhouse will gradually decrease. Additionally, without sunlight, the plants inside the greenhouse will not be able to carry out photosynthesis efficiently, which may lead to decreased growth and productivity. Once the perturbation ends and sunlight returns, the greenhouse effect process resumes, with the temperature inside the greenhouse rising again.

Q: Question: In what state did McAtee play professional hockey in the NHL? Passage 1:Channel 11, as KFJZ-TV, first signed on the air at 2:30 p.m. on September 11, 1955, after a launch ceremony culminating in Fort Worth oilman Sid Richardson flipping the ceremonial switch to activate the transmitter. It was the first independent station to sign on in Texas, the fourth television station to sign on in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex (after NBC affiliate WBAP-TV (channel 5, now KXAS-TV), which signed on the air on September 29, 1948; ABC affiliate KBTV (channel 8, now WFAA), which debuted on September 17, 1949; and CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (channel 4, now Fox owned-and-operated station KDFW), which debuted on December 3, 1949), and the first to debut in the market since the FCC's 1952 lifting of a four-year freeze on new applications for television station licenses. Originally, Channel 11 maintained a 9½-hour per day programming schedule, starting with its sign-on at 2:30 p.m. and concluding at its midnight sign-off. The station originally operated from facilities at 4801 West Freeway (in the present-day location of Interstate 30) in Fort Worth.  Passage 2:Norman Joseph McAtee (June 28, 1921 – August 25, 2010) was a professional ice hockey player who played 13 games in the National Hockey League with the Boston Bruins. Born in Stratford, Ontario, he and his brother Jud played together in junior ice hockey with the Oshawa Generals during the years when the Generals dominated the Ontario Hockey League, winning championships with them in 1938–39. 1939–40 and 1940–41. At the end of the 1941 season, Norm joined his brother by signing as a free agent with the Detroit Red Wings in the NHL. However, beginning in 1942 and lasting throughout World War II, Norm became a flying officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force. After his discharge in 1945, he teamed with his brother in the Red Wings farm system before the two of them were traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for Doug McCaig in December 1945. Just over a month later, Chicago traded him to Boston for Bill Jennings, and Norm joined the Bruins for 13 games, recording one assist. After that, he finished his career in the minor leagues, ending as player-coach with the Troy Bruins in Troy, Ohio from 1951 to 1954.  Passage 3:The copper ore deposits are those of a typical copper porphyry and associated alteration-mineralization. These altered zones include chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite and molybdenite as hypogene minerals and chalcocite as a supergene mineral. The ore body surrounds the Braden Pipe in a continuous ring with a width of 2000 feet. The pipe is a geologic structure in the shape of an inverted cone, having a surface diameter of 4000 feet, and consisting of post-pipe breccia called the Braden Formation. The boundary of the pipe is marked by this post-pipe breccia and a pre-pipe breccia forming a belt up to 200 feet wide. \\"The Braden Pipe was a center of strong mineralization and structural weakness before the pipe was formed.\\" Copper mineralization and pipe formation occurred in the Pliocene. Ore was originally mined from the Fortuna orebody at the southwest quadrant starting in 1906.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Where did Ruisdael live for over 25 years? , can you please find it?   During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft.

Born in Haarlem in 1628 or 1629, Ruisdael was known for his remarkable contribution to landscape art, encompassing various themes such as forests, rivers, dunes, and country roads, among others.  In the 1650s, Ruisdael moved from his birth town, Haarlem, to Amsterdam. It was during this time that he produced many of his masterpieces. Despite living in Amsterdam for over 25 years, the city is not prominently featured in his body of work. However, the few works that do portray Amsterdam still showcase Ruisdael's signature style and the beautiful landscapes that he is known for. While living in Amsterdam, Ruisdael experienced significant professional success. His fame grew beyond the borders of the Netherlands, with his artwork eventually making its way into prominent art collections throughout Europe. Some of his most famous works created during this time include \\"Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede\\" (1670) and various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline, known as Haerlempjes, which often prominently featured Saint Bavo's Church. Despite the lack of Amsterdam-specific landscapes within Ruisdael's oeuvre, his time living in the city undeniably had an impact on his work and career. Amsterdam's thriving art market provided Ruisdael with the opportunity to develop relationships with clients, collectors, and fellow artists, ultimately leading to his growing reputation, success, and legacy as one of the greatest landscape painters of his time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Because they could earn more money as railroad laborers.; [B]. Because they had to make a living by working as railroad laborers.; [C]. Because they thought railroad was the first step to find gold.; [D]. Because railroad laborers were greatly honored at that time.; Read the following article and answer the question. Article: You may have heard the term \\"the American Dream\\". In 1848, James W. Marshall found gold in California and people began having golden dreams. That 19th century \\"American Dream\\" motivated   the Gold Rush and gave California its nickname of the \\"Golden State\\". The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next. People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets. But most, instead, worked as railroad labourers. They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \\"the old gold hill\\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare. Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley. People poured their energy into the Internet. This new chapter of the American Dream attracted many business people and young talents from China and India to form start-ups and seek fortunes in America. Better pay, a nice house, and a rising standard of living will always be attractive. However, the new American Dream is no longer just about money. It encourages Americans to consume wisely to protect the environment, improve the quality of life, and promote social justice. The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become the model of the new American Dream. After years of hard work, he grew from a poor young man from Austria into a movie superstar and then governor. Many people hope his story can save the American Dream and give California a brighter future. Question: Why did most of the early immigrants work as railroad laborers? Answer: Answer:","output":"B. Because they had to make a living by working as railroad laborers. Reasoning: The passage states that people came to America in hopes of finding gold in the streets. However, most of them ended up working as railroad laborers since they needed to make a living.

Alcoholics Anonymous is a non-profit, international organization dedicated to helping individuals who suffer from alcohol addiction by providing a supportive and structured environment where they can share their experiences, strength, and hope with other members to help each other achieve and maintain sobriety. AA meetings and fellowship create a strong support group for those struggling with alcohol addiction. The foundation of Alcoholics Anonymous is based on a program known as the \\"Twelve Steps,\\" a spiritual and practical guide originally co-developed by Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith. The Twelve-Step program encourages self-examination, making amends, and relying on a higher power to help maintain sobriety. This program has been widely adopted by numerous addiction treatment and support organizations, forming the basis of programs like Narcotics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, and Gamblers Anonymous. AA operates on the principle of anonymity, which is designed to protect members from stigma and assure them that their privacy will be respected. There are no membership fees or formal requirements for participation in AA meetings, which are open to anyone who has a desire to stop drinking. Members are encouraged to attend meetings regularly and find a sponsor, an experienced AA member who can guide and support them through the Twelve Steps. Bill Wilson, who co-founded AA, was a stockbroker from New York who had a history of alcohol abuse. After achieving sobriety through his spiritual conversion and the help of a support group, he felt the need to share his experience with others struggling with alcohol addiction. He met Dr. Bob Smith, a physician from Akron, Ohio, who also had a history of alcoholism, and together they founded Alcoholics Anonymous. The combination of the Twelve Step program and community support has proved very effective in helping millions of people achieve and maintain sobriety since its inception. Today, AA has over 2 million members worldwide, with meetings held in more than 170 countries. The organization's forward-thinking approach to addiction recovery and group support continues to help people overcome alcohol addiction and has left a lasting impact on addiction treatment as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Formula One championship leader Nico Rosberg claimed pole position for Sunday's British Grand Prix after a rain-affected qualifying session that saw his Mercedes teammate and title rival Lewis Hamilton slip back to sixth position, having at one stage looked set for top spot. World champion Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull claimed second position on the grid at Silverstone on Saturday, while McLaren's Jenson Button boosted hopes of a home winner by qualifying third. Force India's Nico Hulkenberg and Kevin Magnussen of McLaren picked up positions four and five respectively. Hamilton, who trails Rosberg by 29 points overall, had looked set to claim pole but pulled out of his final lap believing the damp conditions meant he could not better his Q3 time. But as the skies cleared and track dried, Rosberg, Vettel, Button, Hulkenberg and Magnussen all passed the Briton. Rosberg, with whom he has had a tetchy relationship at times this season, later spoke of his relief at Hamilton's decision. \\"Wow, what a qualifying. It was so tricky out there this afternoon with the rain and the conditions changing so quickly,\\" the German said. \\"My last flying lap was difficult because we were very tight for time and I was stuck right up behind Lewis. \\"Luckily he didn't finish his lap but I remembered that we were losing three or four seconds in the last corners when it was very wet, so there was an opportunity to make a real improvement and that I should keep going.\\" \\"It's a great opportunity to start the race from pole and I'll give it everything to take the win tomorrow.\\" Latest results and standings.

There were shock exits in Q1, as Williams' Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas were eliminated along with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso. It was a big setback for Massa and Bottas, who were on the front row in Austria just two weeks ago.

A doctor who was known as 'an octopus' has been jailed for groping colleagues at the hospital where he worked as an anaesthetist. Dr Niaz Ahmed viewed women's genitals as they recovered from surgery and gave saucy underwear to a stunned young colleague, a court heard. The 55-year-old was known as 'always the octopus, hands all over the place' by nurses and staff who he made repeated lewd comments to at South Tyneside Hospital in Tyne and Wear. Dr Niaz Ahmed, pictured, was jailed for groping staff at the hospital where he worked as an anaesthetist. Newcastle Crown Court heard the 'highly skilled' doctor, who boasted he was 'looking for women the day after he got married' was repeatedly warned by hospital bosses to tone down his behaviour. A jury convicted him of two indecent assault charges on his co-workers, during incidents more than a decade ago. Judge Simon Hickey jailed Ahmed, of Broadlands, Cleadon, for 18 months and said he must sign the sex offender register for ten years. The judge said Ahmed had shown 'no remorse' for his behaviour, which he tried to pass off as 'social clumsiness'. The 55-year-old was known as 'always the octopus, hands all over the place' by nurses. Judge Hickey told him: 'These women expected, and could expect, to be treated not only with respect and courtesy but as professionals in their own right. 'You were expected not to touch them in any way, particularly a sexual way. 'The evidence in the case revealed your inappropriate behaviour towards women in general in the hospital. 'The nurses spoke in terms of you leaving your post as an anaesthetist and viewing the private, genital areas of women when they were unconscious. 'Others speak of you giving inappropriate underwear to one young nurse, extremely embarrassing her. Others speak of suggestive behaviour and comments. 'The evidence was overwhelming in terms of what you were doing and the boundaries you were stepping over. 'You used your authority over those two victims to commit these offences. 'This was not social clumsiness, this was a man who knew he was stepping over a clear line.' Ahmed, who was suspended from medical practice at a tribunal earlier this year for groping a nurse who was treating him after an accident in 2010, was cleared of three similar charges. The General Medical Council ruled Ahmed, who no longer works at the hospital, could continue to practice, under strict conditions, after the recent convictions. Prosecutor Michael Hodson told the court during the trial that Ahmed had not committed 'grave' sex crimes and caused no serious physical injury to his victims. But he added: 'Imagine what it was like going to work with a sex pest, always the octopus, hands all over the place, underlined by innuendo.' Ahmed made lewd comments to nurses and staff while working at South Tyneside District Hospital, pictured. Mr Hodson said one victim was targeted in the scrub room at the hospital, where Ahmed squeezed her bottom and asked her: 'Do you fancy it?' Another had her breasts prodded by the medic while she was at work and said he had told her 'put them away'. Ahmed denied the charges against him and claimed his behaviour was 'jokes and banter'. Mr Hodson added: 'As all sex pests may well do to get away with their nuisance behaviour, they pass it off as banter, as he did.' The court heard that during a meeting with hospital bosses in 2000, Ahmed accepted it was inappropriate to touch nurses and said any offence caused by him was entirely innocent and accidental. During a later meeting with management, he said his behaviour continued to be innocent and in fitting with the 'culture' of the hospital. Ahmed had claimed he was the victim of a 'witch hunt' in 2012 after he was cleared of sexually assaulting two teenage girls at a fireworks display in South Shields in 2011. The youngsters claimed Ahmed had groped them after boasting about the size of his manhood and complaining about his sex life with his wife. Tom Moran, defending, said Ahmed has had an offer of work out of the area, adding: 'He is highly regarded for his professional abilities.' Newcastle Crown Court, pictured, heard Ahmed viewed women's genitals as they recovered from surgery and gave saucy underwear to a stunned young colleague. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Dr. Niaz Ahmed, a 55-year-old anaesthetist, has been jailed for 18 months after being convicted of two indecent assault charges at South Tyneside Hospital in Tyne and Wear. He was known by nurses and staff as 'an octopus' due to his inappropriate touching of colleagues and patients while they were recovering from surgery. The court heard that Ahmed made lewd comments to staff and, despite several warnings from hospital management, did not change his behavior. Judge Simon Hickey ordered Ahmed to sign the sex offender register for ten years, citing his lack of remorse and clear overstepping of boundaries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake doesn't inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop., what would be the answer ?

But the puzzle was solved Monday as one of the twins, Yoan Gomis, confessed in court to the sexual assaults after some victims identified him through the fact that he is partially deaf and stutters.

The victors ruled on Mt. Olympus and imprisoned the vanquished -- the Titans -- beneath Mt. Tartarus on Earth. Also lost during the battle is the Bow of Epirus, a mighty weapon that can shoot invincible energy arrows.Centuries later, King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) mounts a campaign to recover the Bow of Epirus and free the Titans. Bitter over the deaths of his wife and children due to disease, he is resolved to destroy the gods who refused his prayers to spare his family. He overtakes the Sybelline Monastery, imprisoning the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and her attendants, then lays waste to villages in the area. In one village works the stone mason Theseus (Henry Cavil). Theseus has been trained in the military arts by a mysterious Old Man (John Hurt) who encourages him to be a protector of all humanity; Theseus, whose devout mother was raped and thus considered an outcast, refuses. When the goddess Athena (Isabel Lucas) visits the Old Man, he is revealed to be Zeus (Luke Evans) in human disguise.When Hyperion's forces destroy Theseus's village, he kills Theseus's mother in front of him and imprisons Theseus, where Phaedra and her attendants are also kept. Phaedra inadvertently touches Theseus and has a vision of him as either the savior of humanity or the ally of Hyperion in the destruction of the world. That night, she and her attendants seduce and kill the guards; Phaedra escapes with Theseus and two other slaves, Stavros (Steven Dorff) and Daerios (Alan Van Spring).Although Zeus has forbidden the gods to intervene unless the Titans are freed, Athena, Poseidon (Kellan Lutz) and Ares (Daniel Sharman) determine to protect Theseus as best they can.

Write a text based on \\"ex-president of costa rica held ahead of corruption trial\\" Text:","output":"Title: Former Costa Rican President Detained in Corruption Scandal: A Glimpse into the Unfolding Political Crisis In a stunning development in Central American politics, the former president of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias Sánchez, has been detained as a key figure in a far-reaching corruption scandal that could undermine the credibility of the nation's political institutions and cast a dark cloud over one of Latin America's most stable democracies. Arias Sánchez, who served two non-consecutive terms as president from 1986 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2010, was apprehended by agents of the Judicial Investigation Department (OIJ) following allegations of bribery, money laundering, and abuse of authority. These charges—once seen as unthinkable against one of the most admired figures in Costa Rican politics—have stunned the country and raised uncomfortable questions about how deep-rooted corruption may be among its political and business elites. The investigation into Arias Sánchez's alleged wrongdoing stems from concerns about his connections to a Chinese-funded infrastructure project. Critics have accused the ex-president of accepting millions of dollars in bribes to award contracts for the development of a roadway between San José, the capital of Costa Rica, and Limón, the largest city on the Caribbean coastline. Though prosecutors have yet to release specific details, the allegations assert that Arias Sánchez enabled the Chinese engineering firm responsible for the project to skirt regulatory safeguards and engage in underhanded bidding practices. Consequently, the ongoing trial threatens to expose a web of corruption involving prominent business executives, political allies, and members of the judiciary handpicked by the former president. The severity of the charges against Arias Sánchez cannot be overstated. If found guilty, the former president could face years in prison, a penalty virtually unheard of for a former head of state in the region. Furthermore, his arrest has cast doubt on the verdicts he handed down as an outspoken critic of corruption during his tenure, signaling that the ongoing trial is merely the tip of the iceberg. It bears mentioning that the Costa Rican legal system has already been shaken by recent judicial scandals, which raises questions about the impartiality of the process. The implications of this case stretch beyond Costa Rica, as they directly impact the region’s perception of democracy and anti-corruption efforts. Arias Sánchez was a prominent figure in Central American politics who had gained international recognition for his role in brokering peace agreements, including the Esquipulas Peace Accord in 1987 that played a significant part in ending years of civil conflict in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. With a Nobel Peace Prize to his name, the well-respected Arias Sánchez was seen as a defender of democracy and good governance. That a figure of such stature and moral authority could be implicated in a graft scandal raises concerns that the systemic issues driving corruption are not limited to a select few, but are instead widespread, even in ostensibly stable and prosperous nations. Countries across Central America are grappling with the effects of these revelations, as they weigh the implications of this scandal on their own efforts to curb corruption and bolster democracy. The Arias Sánchez case can be viewed as a microcosm of the broader challenges faced by the region, as political elites struggle to regain the trust of a disillusioned and frustrated public. Amidst this backdrop of regional instability and lingering uncertainty, the people of Costa Rica are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the trial. The case against the former president presents an opportunity for the country to demonstrate its commitment to the rule of law and to substantiate its reputation for transparency and good governance. As the judicial proceedings unfold, it is crucial for Costa Rica to rise above the shadow of corruption and prove that no individual, not even a former head of state, is above the law or beyond the reach of justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer choices: - cells  - cows  - Oak  - embryos  - pollen  - Flowers  - seeds  - legumes Answer:","output":"Cells contain genetic instructions, which are essential for the functioning, development, and reproduction of living organisms. Genetic instructions are encoded in the form of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecules located within the nucleus of each cell. Various structures within cells such as chromosomes and genes carry these genetic instructions and transmit them from one generation to another. Here is a detailed explanation of the answer choices provided: 1. Cells: As mentioned previously, cells contain genetic instructions in the form of DNA. In organisms such as animals, plants, and fungi, these instructions are stored in the nucleus of the cell. In prokaryotes (organisms without a nucleus), DNA is found in a circular form within the cytoplasm of the cell.  2. Cows: As a living organism, cows also consist of cells that each contain genetic instructions in the form of DNA. Similar to other animals, the genetic instructions in cows are vital for their growth, development, and reproduction. However, cows themselves do not \\"contain\\" genetic instructions; instead, it is the cells in their body that hold these instructions. 3. Oak: An oak tree is also a living organism consisting of cells with genetic instructions. In the case of plants, genetic information stored within cells plays a role in controlling various functions, growth, and reproduction. 4. Embryos: An embryo is the early stage of development in multicellular organisms, such as humans and animals. Cells within the embryo contain genetic instructions in the form of DNA, which influences the development and differentiation of various cell types that eventually become tissues and organs. 5. Pollen: Pollen grains are important for the reproductive process of flowering plants, as they facilitate the transfer of genetic material from the male reproductive structures (anthers) to the female reproductive structures (pistil). Pollen grains contain cells with genetic instructions that will contribute to the formation of seeds, ensuring the next generation of plants. 6. Flowers: Flowers are the reproductive organs of flowering plants, containing both male and female parts crucial for their reproduction. The cells within the flowers also have genetic instructions that contribute to the formation of pollen and seeds, as well as ensure proper growth and maintenance of the flower. 7. Seeds: Seeds are the matured ovules of plants, containing embryonic plant tissue and the potential to develop into a new plant. The cells within the seeds also hold genetic instructions that guide the growth, development, and reproduction of the resulting plant. 8. Legumes: Legumes refer to a family of plants, including beans, peas, lentils, and many others. Similar to other living organisms, the cells within legume plants contain genetic instructions necessary for their various life processes, reproduction, and overall survival. In summary, the answer to the question \\"What contains genetic instructions?\\" is cells. Cells within living organisms such as animals (cows), plants (oak, flowers, seeds, and legumes), reproductive cells (embryos, pollen), and many other organisms contain the genetic instructions required for development, growth, and reproduction. These essential instructions are encoded within DNA molecules located within the nucleus or cytoplasm of cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  and the situation: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present.  Answer the following question: Who is more likely to have lowered oxygen supply to their heart muscles? Answer:","output":"Given the background and situation, Jake is more likely to have a lowered oxygen supply to his heart muscles. This is because he has a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall, as identified during the physical examination.

Search teams are combing a Texas lake for the body of a man who was allegedly shot and killed by Mexican pirates when he and his wife were ambushed after crossing into Mexican waters on their personal watercraft.      David Michael Hartley, 30, and his wife Tiffany Hartley, 29, were attacked on Falcon Lake, near the southern tip of Texas, police said.      Tiffany Hartley told police her husband was shot in the back of the head as the couple fled to U.S. waters.      Play      The gunmen are suspected to be Mexican pirates who have been marauding on the lake, law enforcement officials said.      Hartley fell off his watercraft after he was shot, according to his wife, who told rescuers and police she attempted to circle back to save him, but the gunmen were still firing shots so she had to abandon the rescue attempt.      Texas Department of Public Safety officials said Friday they believed that David Hartley was dead, but his body has yet to be found.      U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Narcizo Ramos told The Associated Press that he didn't know whether Mexican authorities were searching their side.      According to Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr., Tiffany Hartley said she and her husband were returning to U.S. waters after sightseeing and taking photos when they saw armed men aboard some boats.      The couple \\"observed some boats coming at them at a pretty high rate of speed, noticed that some of the boats were armed so they immediately started, according to her, revving it up and gassing it up to the U.S, side of the border to prevent them getting hurt,\\" he said. \\"Then, of course, shots started being fired at them.      \\"She said she was seeing bullets hitting close to her in the water and realized that her husband had been hit behind the head,\\" he said. \\"She went back trying to find, trying to help him. She went in the water trying to load up her husband to her Jet Ski ... trying to get his body and Jet Ski back to the U.S. side.      Play      \\"She was being shot at so she finally had to let go of the body, climb back in her Jet Ski and head back over here to the United States,\\" he said.      Tiffany Hartley told The Denver Post she believes that her husband was shot five to six miles from the Texas shoreline. Once she was able to reach the shore in Zapata, she parked and called for help.      One of the boats may have crossed into U.S. waters briefly while trying to run her down, she said.      Gonzalez said police at first were not sure whether to believe her story, despite the history of violence on the lake, but another person came forward and said described seeing a woman on a watercraft being chased by men in a boat.      A Recent Increase in Violence      Falcon Lake, part of the Rio Grande situated directly on the Texas-Mexico border, has recently become a haven for the pirates, and there have been at least five reported run-ins with pirates on the lake so far this year, though this is the first instance of a death.      The sheriff said many of the pirates are teens or preteens, and some \\"barely even know how to use a weapon.\\"      But despite that, he said he has long feared that someone would be killed.      \\"The one thing I dreaded on Falcon Lake has happened,\\" he said. \\"The lake is not secure, the border is not secure because the incident that I dreaded the most has in fact happened. We cannot go to Mexico, we cannot recover that body, we cannot conduct an investigation, we have to tell the family we can't do anything about it.\\"      According to ABC Rio Grande, Texas, affiliate KRGV-TV, there have been at least four previous incidents on the lake over the past five months:      April 30: Four heavily armed men boarded two boats near the Old Guerrero area demanding money.      May 6: Two armed men approached a boat and demanded cash.      May 16: Five armed men boarded a boat on the United States side of the lake.      Aug 31: Pirates, using a small boat marked \\"Game Wardin\\" tried to stop a Texas fisherman.      State Representative Aaron Pena, a south Texas lawmaker briefed on the pirates earlier this year, has suggested that residents stay off of Falcon Lake altogether.      \\"I wouldn't do it. When I go out there I have all the protection Texas can provide. But the average fisherman doesn't have that,\\" Pena said.      Pena added that he is certain that the pirates are working in operation with Mexico's violent drug cartels, who wouldn't allow the pirates on the lake otherwise.      Texas public safety officials said that the pirates use AK-47s or AR-15s to intimidate their victims. They also said that they believe they use local fisherman to man the boats to get as close as possible to American vessels.      Texas Gov. Rick Perry said this week's deadly shooting points to the need for further border security.      \\"It's really become substantially worse in the last 18 months with the drug cartels having almost free rein,\\" Perry said Friday. \\"This is about our citizens', on both sides of the borders, safety.\\" ||||| (Oct. 3) -- Dodging gunfire from pirates on a Texas-Mexico border lake, Tiffany Hartley was forced to make an impossible choice: risk her life by staying with her husband or return to land and seek help.The couple were sightseeing on Jet Skis on the Mexican side of Falcon Lake on Thursday when Hartley says several boats of gunmen opened fire, striking her husband in the back of his head.A recording of her 911 call released this weekend and reports from law enforcement officials detail the tragic incident.\\"He was thrown off the Jet Ski and I couldn't pick him up to get him on mine,\\" Hartley, 29, told the 911 dispatcher after she safely made it to shore. \\"Oh, God.\\"Texas authorities believe David Hartley, 30, died in the attack.\\"[Tiffany Hartley] said she was seeing bullets hitting close to her in the water and realized that her husband had been hit behind the head,\\" Zapata County, Texas, Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr. told ABC News . \\"She went back trying to find, trying to help him.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"The two questions are related in the sense that they are both inquiring about losing belly fat. However, they are not inquiring about the same information. The first question specifically asks if running 5km every day, drinking milk, and eating meat without bread will result in losing belly fat, whereas the second one asks if running 5km for 30 minutes per week is enough to lose belly fat. Let's address each question individually. 1) Will I lose my belly fat if I run 5km everyday, drink milk, and eat meat without any bread? Losing belly fat requires a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise. It is essential to burn more calories than you consume in order to create a calorie deficit. Running 5km every day will help burn a significant number of calories, which can contribute to weight loss, including belly fat reduction. According to the American Council on Exercise, an individual weighing 68kg (150lbs) can burn approximately 372 calories by running at 6mph for 30 minutes. If you consistently run 5km daily, it will add up to a considerable calorie burn over time. However, just running every day isn't enough to guarantee you'll lose belly fat. Your diet also plays a key role. Drinking milk and eating meat without bread may contribute to a well-balanced diet, but it's crucial to consider the overall caloric intake and the quality of other food items you consume throughout the day. Drinking milk provides essential nutrients like calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D but should be consumed in moderation due to its calorie content. Lean meats are great sources of protein, and cutting out bread may contribute to a lower carbohydrate intake. However, it would help if you replaced carbohydrates with healthier alternatives like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. 2) Is 5km for 30 minutes per week enough to lose belly fat? Running 5km for 30 minutes per week can contribute to your weight loss efforts, but it may not be enough by itself to lose belly fat effectively. A single 30-minute running session may yield some health benefits, but it might not be sufficient to create a significant calorie deficit and produce visible changes in belly fat. To achieve better results in losing belly fat, it is advised to follow a consistent exercise routine that includes at least 150-300 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking) or 75-150 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise (such as running) per week, alongside two sessions of muscle-strengthening activities that target all major muscle groups. In addition to exercise, it is paramount to follow a healthy diet plan that consists of a balanced mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, alongside various essential vitamins and minerals. Maintain a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn, and ensure that the calories you do consume come from nutrient-dense, whole foods. In conclusion, both questions address the topic of losing belly fat, but they do not inquire about the same information. It's essential to have a well-rounded lifestyle that includes consistent exercises and a healthy, balanced diet to effectively lose belly fat. Consider consulting a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific needs and goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Passenger pigeons  once flew over much of the United States in unbelievable numbers. Written accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries described flocks  so large that they darkened the sky for hours. It was calculated that when its population reached its highest point, there were more than 3 billion passenger pigeons--a number equal to 24 to 40 percent of the total bird population in the United States, making it perhaps the most abundant bird in the world. Even as late as 1870 when their numbers had already become smaller, a flock believed to be 1 mile wide and 320 miles (about 515 kilometers) long was seen near Cincinnati. Sadly, the abundance of passenger pigeons may have been their _ . Where the birds were most abundant, people believed there was an ever-lasting supply and killed them by the thousands. Commercial hunters attracted them to small clearings with grain, waited until pigeons had settled to feed, then threw large nets over them, taking hundreds at a time. The birds were shipped to large cities and sold in restaurants. By the closing decades of the 19th century, the hardwood forests where passenger pigeons nested had been damaged by Americans' need for wood, which scattered   the flocks and forced the birds to go farther north, where cold temperatures and spring storms contributed to their decline. Soon the great flocks were gone, never to be seen again. In 1897, the state of Michigan passed a law prohibiting the killing of passenger pigeons, but by then, no sizable flocks had been seen in the state for 10 years. The last confirmed wild pigeon in the United States was shot by a boy in Pike County, Ohio, in 1900. For a time, a few birds survived under human care. The last of them, known affectionately as Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden on September 1, 1914. Question: What can we infer about the law passed in Michigan? - It was ignored by the public. - It was declared too late. - It was unfair. - It was strict. Answer:","output":"We can infer that the law passed in Michigan was declared too late. The article states that by the time the law was passed in 1897, no sizable flocks of passenger pigeons had been seen in the state for 10 years. This suggests that the law, though well-intended, came too late to have a significant impact on the preservation of the passenger pigeon population in Michigan or the United States in general."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Facts:   - years active: 1997 -- present    - kickbox koloss: 4    - team: super pro gym      - birth date: 3 august 1980    - weight: 70 kg lb st on    - style: boxing , kickboxing    - other names: the hurricane    - caption: kraus at the backstage of k-1 turkey in 2007    - height: 1.75 1    - box loss: 0    - box kowin: 4    - name: albert kraus    - kickbox draw: 3    - birth place: oss , netherlands    - box win: 5    - updated: june 29 , 2014    - box draw: 0    - kickbox loss: 20    - nationality: dutch    - kickbox win: 79    - url: http://www.albert-kraus.com    - weight class: welterweight middleweight    - kickbox kowin: 47    - trainer: dennis krauweel    - image: albert the champ.jpg   Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of albert kraus .

I know he didn't mean to hurt me, but I was mad about it all. Day. Long. I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again. I definitely trust him, and he actually was being playful, but otherwise that has been the only “real” hitch we have come across.

Answer the following question: A 13-year-old American has made a cheap machine that can help blind people read. The blind can read by using _ - a system of small bumps   that the blind touch to read the letters. The machine that makes these small bumps usually costs at least 2,000. It is called Braille writer. The American schoolboy, Shubham Banerjee, made a new Braille writer from a Lego tool that lets people create robots. Banerjee has called his new machine the Braigo - a combination   of the words Braille and Lego. It costs just  350. It works by changing electronic text into Braille and then printing it using a computer or mobile machine. Banerjee designed   his Braigo last year for a school science exhibition. Since then, he has caught the interest of Silicon Valley in the USA. The big technology company Intel spent money on Banerjee's machine last November, but they did not say how much money they put in. Banerjee also got 35, 000 from his father to help him start the project. His father works as a computer engineer   at Intel. He spoke about why he gave so much money to his son, saying:\\"We as parents started to be interested more, thinking that he's on to something and this invention has to continue.\\" Banerjee told the AP News: \\"My dream would probably be having most of the blind people...using my Braigo.\\" How much will one save if he buys a Braigo instead of a usual Braille writer?

Mosaic has a long history, starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC. Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Early Christian basilicas from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the Byzantine Empire from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the Norman kingdom in Sicily in the 12th century, by eastern-influenced Venice, and among the Rus in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like Raphael continued to practise the old technique. Roman and Byzantine influence led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics.  Bronze age pebble mosaics have been found at Tiryns; mosaics of the 4th century BC are found in the Macedonian palace-city of Aegae, and the 4th-century BC mosaic of The Beauty of Durrës discovered in Durrës, Albania in 1916, is an early figural example; the Greek figural style was mostly formed in the 3rd century BC. Mythological subjects, or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy, were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design, with strongly emphasized borders.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

It was first performed at the Birmingham Festival in England on August 26, 1846. The oratorio tells the biblical story of the prophet Elijah and is a dramatic and moving work. Mendelssohn successfully combined elements of traditional religious choral music with the operatic style of his time, creating an enduring masterpiece that has enjoyed popularity with audiences and performers since its premiere. The \\"Italian Symphony,\\" officially titled Symphony No. 4 in A major, Op. 90, was composed by Mendelssohn between 1830 and 1833.

UPDATED:. 04:44 EST, 30 November 2012. China's new prime minister is the man behind one of the biggest medical scandals of all time. In the 1990s between 50,000 and 300,000 people were mistakenly infected with HIV in Henan province and  Li Keqiang, the man who led the cover-up is now China's new leader. Mr Li was governor of the area in 1998 when people contracted HIV. from state-sponsored blood-buying rings with unhygienic practices. Hypocrisy: Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang presides over a State Council AIDS Working Committee, in Beijing on Monday. Mr Li was governor of Henan province in 1998 when people contracted HIV from state-sponsored blood-buying rings with unhygienic practices. Activists have urged Li to acknowledge the government's responsibility. for the disaster and provide compensation, with little success. There are no official figures because. the Chinese government has never admitted or apologised for what. happened but now Mr Li is desperately trying to rectify his shadowy. past. Earlier this week Li shook hands with Aids victims on Chinese television and promised to. let NGOs play a more active role in battling the disease. The stigma against people with HIV runs especially deep in China, from. being unofficially barred from government jobs to being expelled from. school. Tough talk: During a meeting Monday with a dozen activist groups Li said health facilities that discriminate against people with HIV would be severely punished. An estimated 780,000 people have HIV in China. In China, hospitals routinely reject people with HIV for surgery out of. fear of exposure to the virus or harm to their reputations. But last Friday, following Mr Li's orders, the health ministry banned hospitals from turning away infected patients. During a meeting Monday with a dozen activist groups, he said such. discrimination would be severely punished, according to Li Hu. After years. of denying AIDS was a problem in China, the country has significantly. improved care for patients, but the lingering stigma sets back those. advances. One of those infected was Wang Pinghe who was just 12-yearsold when he had a chest operation and was contracted HIV. He did not realise he  was ill but suffered fevers which last for weeks and some mornings he found he could not even open his eyes. After leaving school, he worked in factories and then dug irrigation systems in western China. Now aged 28, Mr Wang was diagnosed with full-blown Aids in May. 'My parents cried for four days. I am their only son,' he told The Telegraph. Mr Wang wants the tumor in his liver removed before it becomes life-threatening. But the 28-year-old Chinese villager knows it will be hard to find a hospital that will do the operation because of his diease. Lasting legacy: 28-year-old HIV patient Wang Pinghe shows bottles of medicine pills he has been taking. He was infected when he was just 12-years-old. 'In my hometown, not a single hospital is willing to operate on people infected with HIV,' said Wang, who traveled to Beijing from Runan county in the central province of Henan to try to draw the attention of central authorities to the issue by speaking to the foreign media. 'This is not discrimination by one single person but by an entire country.' Now, as more people rail against the myriad inequalities that plague Chinese society, people with HIV are becoming increasingly willing to assert their right to fair treatment. One man recently claimed the spotlight by altering his medical records to hide his HIV-positive condition so he could get surgery for lung cancer. The man, who went by the pseudonym Xiaofeng, told state media he had been turned away by two hospitals. His story sparked a firestorm of criticism directed at both the hospitals for rejecting him and thepatient for exposing medical staff to risks they were not aware of. [caption. 'Xiaofeng was smart. When he felt that his life was in danger, he found a way to save himself,' said Li Hu, a Tianjin-based activist who helped Xiaofeng and later publicized the case online. 'But this way isn't good for anyone, be it the patient or medical workers. Now the question is: Can we find a way that is favorable for everyone?' China has made significant strides in tackling the epidemic, with the AIDS mortality rate falling 64 percent from 2002 to last year. The government last year increased HIV treatment by 50 percent — reaching three-quarters of the adults and children who require it, according UNAIDS. An estimated 780,000 people have HIV in China. There has been an increasing trend of cases transmitted through sex rather than intravenously, with sex workers and gay men considered most at risk, said Guy Taylor, a communications officer for UNAIDS. Treatment: With improved access to lifesaving drugs, people with HIV in China are living longer, which means more are seeking treatment for other ailments. About 70,000 new cases were reported in the first 10 months of this year, largely through sexual transmission, as compared with about 93,000 for all of last year, the Health Ministry announced this week at a news conference ahead of World AIDS Day on Saturday. With improved access to lifesaving drugs, people with HIV in China are living longer, which means more are seeking treatment for other ailments. Chinese law bars medical facilities from refusing to treat people with HIV, but activists say discrimination continues because the law spells out no serious punishments. Many patients cannot afford the time and expense of taking hospitals to court. The China Alliance of People Living with HIV/AIDS, a Beijing-based network, said that a survey last year found dozens of patients being turned away by facilities throughout the country — in some cases even leading to deaths. 'I feel that if a doctor refuses to treat a patient who is HIV positive, it is a crime akin to murder,' said the group's coordinator, Meng Lin, who recounted being denied a CT scan by a Beijing doctor in September, after he told him he had AIDS. Dr. Wu Zunyou, who leads the government's HIV/AIDS center, said he believes attitudes will change. He said Chinese health workers report about 700 cases of accidental contact with the every year and none have resulted in infections. He welcomed the public debate the Tianjin case triggered. 'The debate causes medical workers to think about the issue and health facilities to improve their management, so there should be fewer chances for such things to happen in the future,' Wu said.","output":"This article from 2012 discusses the medical scandal in China, where between 50,000 and 300,000 people were mistakenly infected with HIV in Henan province during the 1990s, due to state-sponsored blood-buying rings with unhygienic practices.

I'll consider common sense knowledge about horses and their participation in various activities. A: Campagne (campaign) - Horses can participate in campaigns, like political campaigns, where people rally for support. However, it is not that common for a horse to be decorated in such an event, so this option might not be the most suitable. B: Films (movies) - Horses can indeed participate in movies, but this option is very broad and there are several types of movies. It's better to check the other options for a more specific participation context to increase accuracy. C: Film de western (western movie) - Horses play a significant role in western movies, carrying cowboys and often being involved in action scenes. It seems like a suitable option, but let's analyze the other options as well. D: Parade - Horses often participate in parades and are typically decorated for the occasion, making this a very suitable option. E: Rodéo (rodeo) - Horses can participate in rodeos, and while they may not be decorated like in parades, they are relevant to the question's context.

Undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin' 80's, which admittedly doesn't sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub-genre like \\"Hard Rock Zombies,\\" \\"Blood Tracks,\\" \\"Terror on Tour,\\" and the especially ungodly Jon-Mikl Thor-starring stinker \\"Rock'n'Roll Nightmare\\" tended to be. That aside, this one still deserves props for downplaying the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f/x razzle-dazzle in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for a mid-80's teen-targeted scarefest. Moreover, the film's pointed sardonic parodying of both ridiculously overblown 80's heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self-righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs who claimed it was the devil's music are very clever and on the money funny (famed Greed Decade heavy metal god Ozzy Osbourne has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti-metal TV evangelist!). Marc Price (the hopelessly dweeby Skippy on \\"Family Ties\\") gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as Eddie \\"Ragman\\" Weinbauer, a geeky, socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal aficionado who's constantly picked on by the stuck-up jerk preppie bullies who make up the majority of the student body at Lakeridge High School (the cruelty and mean-spiritedness of the high school kids is nailed with painfully credible accuracy). Eddie's life takes a turn for the worse when his rock star idol Sammi Curr (an impressively whacked-out portrayal by Tony Fields) perishes in a hotel fire. Hip local disc jockey Nuke (KISS front-man Gene Simmons in a cool cameo) hooks Eddie up with Sammi's final, unreleased album, which when played backwards resurrects Curr's malevolent spirit back from the dead. Sammi encourages Eddie to sic him on all the vile scumbags who make poor Eddie's life the proverbial living hell, only to have meek Eddie prove to be a most reluctant would-be accomplice. It's up to Eddie, assisted by token nice girl Leslie Graham (likeably essayed by the lovely Lisa Orgolini), to stop Sammi before things get too out of hand. Ably directed with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity by character actor Charles Martin Smith (who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher), smartly written by Michael S. Murphy, Joel Soisson, and Rhet Topham, and capably acted by a uniformly up-to-snuff cast, this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty \\"jump\\" moments (an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a grotesquely lecherous long-tongued mutant thingie rates as the definite highlight), a rousing \\"Carrie\\"-style high school dance slaughter sequence, a neatly utilized Halloween setting, revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business, and a solid central message that you shouldn't make a particular over-hyped person your hero strictly because of the calculated anti-establishment posturing said fellow does to qualify for that special status.

Since ants are tiny, they can find thousands of tiny doorways into your residence. Some of them of are easy to identify; others will only be discovered when there's a parade of ants marching through them.","output":"One effective technique to locate and seal off these entry points is to regularly inspect the interior and exterior of your home for any visible cracks, holes, or gaps. Pay close attention to areas where utility lines, pipes, and wires enter your home, as well as around windows, doors, and vents. Repair any damaged seals, caulk or seal gaps, and use weather-stripping for doors and windows to prevent ants and other pests from entering. In addition to sealing off entry points, maintain a clean and clutter-free environment inside your home. Ants are attracted to food residues, so promptly wipe up spills, store food in airtight containers, and avoid leaving dirty dishes in the sink. Additionally, make sure to clean countertops, kitchen appliances, and floors regularly, as well as taking out the trash and ensuring garbage bins are securely closed. Proper waste management and keeping outdoor areas tidy are also crucial to prevent ants from invading your home. Trim overgrown plants and trees that touch your house, as these can act as bridges for ants and other pests. Remove yard debris, such as leaf piles, and store firewood at a considerable distance from your home to avoid giving ants a convenient nesting place. Another potential solution is to use natural deterrents, such as diatomaceous earth or borax, which can be strategically placed around potential entry points or along ant trails. These substances can act as a barrier that ants are hesitant to cross, aiding in keeping them out of your living space. Be cautious when using these materials, especially if you have pets or children, as they can be harmful if ingested. It might be helpful to monitor ant activity outside your home in order to address the root cause of the issue. Identifying and eliminating ant nests and colonies near your residence can significantly reduce the chances of them entering your home. Employing an ant bait system can be an effective method to target and destroy nests and colonies. The worker ants carry the bait back to the colony, resulting in the eventual extermination of the entire group. Lastly, if you find that your ant problem persists even after implementing these preventative measures, it may be necessary to consult with a professional exterminator. They have the expertise and resources to identify the specific type of ant infesting your home and can recommend the most suitable treatment plan to finally eliminate them. In conclusion, preventing ants from entering your home involves a combination of techniques, including sealing off entry points, maintaining cleanliness, utilizing natural deterrents, and addressing possible outdoor colonies. Regularly inspecting and proactively maintaining your living space can go a long way in keeping ants and other pests at bay."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15.  Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned.  Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens.  Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes.  However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring his wife in the attack. On September 15, 1963, Birmingham again earned international attention when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church on a Sunday morning and killed four young girls.  FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe was hired to infiltrate the KKK and monitor their activities and plans. Rowe was involved, along with the Birmingham Police, with the KKK attacks on the Freedom Riders, led by Fred Shuttlesworth, in Anniston, Alabama on May 14, 1961. In...

Movie plot title: Outlander Movie plot: Outlander begins with a spacecraft streaking across the sky. The ship lands in a lake situated around the local fjords of ancient Norway during the time of the Vikings 709AD. From its wreckage emerge two bitter enemies: One) a soldier from another world that speaks Icelandic and states that he came from an Island to the North Kainan and two) a bloodthirsty creature known as the Moorwen. Man and creature both seek revenge for violence committed against them. Before he has a chance to track down the alien, Kainan the Outlander is captured by a Viking warrior, and is held prisoner in the local village led by King Rothgar. As the Moorwen ravages the Viking lands, killing everything in its path, Kainan forms an alliance with the primitive but fierce warriors. Whilst trying to hunt for the Moorwen, war brews among the Vikings, which culminated with both sides taking immense losses. As the enemy Vikings retreat into the forests, the Moorwen strikes, leaving the vikings no choice but to run for help to their once close enemies. Together, the two sides attempt to destroy the Moorwen as a single band of Vikings. The Vikings thus construct a pit filled with oil to lure the Moorwen inside and plan to ignite the fuel, burning the Moorwen, with the help of Kainan. The plan to incinerate the Moorwen fails, leaving the village to take massive casualties, and with the surprise that the Moorwen had given birth to a new, younger Moorwen, which surprises the Vikings from behind and kills the Viking Leader in the process. This leaves the villages in fear and its warriors demoralised, most of the vikings leave the village in search of a new home and safety. Kainan and the remaining loyal warriors stand together to destroy the Moorwen. Kainan realizes from the last battle, that the Moorwen is almost impenetrable with the current metals used, and assists the Vikings by salvaging pieces of his crashed spacecraft and forging weapons capable of harming the creature.

Process:  - Oil is gathered through mining operations - The oil is transported to stores - Oil is purchased by homeowners - Oil is placed into a stove in the house - The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time - The warm air off of the oil travels through the house -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more oil is gathered happens, how will it affect less oil is purchased.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Assuming the perturbation hypothesis is that an increased amount of oil is gathered, let's evaluate its potential effects on the process and whether it would lead to less oil being purchased. If more oil is gathered through mining operations, there are a few possible consequences: 1. Increased supply: With a larger amount of oil available, the overall supply of oil in the market would increase.  2. Price changes: An increased supply of oil could potentially lead to a drop in oil prices, as businesses and suppliers try to sell the excess oil to maintain a balance between supply and demand. This is based on the economic principle of supply and demand - when supply increases, and demand remains constant, prices tend to decrease. 3. Potential for increased use of alternative energy sources: If the increase in oil production significantly affects the environment or contributes to a sense of urgency for cleaner, renewable energy sources, it could result in people seeking out alternative heating methods for their homes, such as solar, geothermal, or electric heating systems. Now let's consider the impact of these potential consequences on the process: 1. If the supply of oil increases and leads to lower oil prices, homeowners may be more likely to purchase oil for their stoves due to the reduced cost. In this scenario, the perturbation would not lead to less oil being purchased; instead, it may potentially increase the amount of purchased oil. 2. On the other hand, if the increased oil supply encourages homeowners to seek alternative energy sources, this could lead to fewer people needing to purchase oil for their stoves, as they opt for more sustainable home heating methods. In this case, the perturbation could indirectly contribute to less oil being purchased. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that assumes more oil is gathered could have both direct and indirect effects on the process by which oil is purchased and used in home heating systems. The actual outcome would depend on various factors, including market reactions, consumer behavior, and potential shifts towards alternative energy sources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Growth weakens, debate over government role intensifies A growth rate below 2 percent isn’t enough to lower the unemployment rate, which was 8.2 percent last month. And few analysts expect the economy to gain momentum in the second half of the year, as concern about debt problems in Europe and the fiscal cliff — a series of tax increases and spending cuts due to take effect in January unless policy makers find an alternative — dampen confidence. The estimated rate of economic growth in the second quarter marked the weakest quarterly gross domestic product reading since last fall and promises to sharpen the scrutiny on President Obama’s fiscal policies. The campaign of Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney seized on the tepid number Friday morning, saying it was indicative of the president’s poor economic stewardship. “It’s very disappointing for the future of the economy,” R. Glenn Hubbard, Romney’s top economic adviser, said on CNBC. “It’s about half of what potential growth actually is in the American economy, and recoveries should be much more vigorous even after financial crises.” Obama administration officials said the economy was being hurt by the fiscal turmoil in Europe and the decline in spending from local and state governments. “Our economy continues to heal from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, but there is much more work to be done,” said acting Commerce Secretary Rebecca Blank. She and other Obama administration officials said Congress should act on the president’s jobs proposal, which would invest in infrastructure, hire more state and local government workers, double the payroll tax cut and offer new tax cuts for small businesses. Republicans have blocked the initiative, saying they oppose a tax surcharge on millionaires to pay for the measure. The GDP report said growth in consumer spending — which accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity — slowed to an annualized rate of 1.5 percent in the second quarter, down from 2.4 percent in the first three months of the year. Automobile sales slowed from the first quarter, and spending on durable goods was down 1 percent, after being up sharply in the first three months of the year. The savings rate, which was pegged at 3.6 percent for the first quarter, bumped up to a 4 percent rate between April and June. The report also included revised growth estimates for the past three years. The new estimates showed that the economy shrank by 3.1 percent in 2009, slightly less than the 3.5 percent previously reported. Growth in 2010 was 2.4 percent, down from 3 percent, and growth in 2011 was 1.8 percent instead of 1.7 percent. The Commerce Department also said that the economy in the first three months of 2012 grew slightly more than previously reported, raising its estimate to a 2 percent rate, from 1.9 percent. Economists speculated that the continued weak GDP growth — which has averaged 2.2 percent since the recovery began three years ago — would spur the Federal Reserve to take further action to lower long-term interest rates in hopes of stimulating the economy. “GDP growth for 2012 is at risk of undershooting the Federal Reserves already subdued expectations,” Ryan Wang, U.S. economist for HSBC, wrote in a note to investors. “. . . Growth will need to average 2.6 percent in the second half of the year for the Fed’s projection to be met. If policymakers feel this pace of growth is no longer likely, they may decide to pursue further monetary easing.” What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the weakening growth rate in the economy, intensifying the debate over the government's role in addressing the issue. The growth rate, below 2%, is not sufficient to lower the unemployment rate, leading to concerns about the economy's ability to gain momentum. Factors such as debt problems in Europe and the upcoming fiscal cliff further contribute to the uncertain economic outlook. The weak economic growth has led to increased scrutiny of President Obama's fiscal policies, especially from his opposition, such as Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney. Obama administration officials argue that the economy is being held back by Europe's fiscal turmoil and reduced spending from local and state governments. They propose the president's job proposals, which include investing in infrastructure and offering new tax cuts for small businesses, as measures to stimulate the economy. However, Republicans have blocked these initiatives, opposing a tax surcharge on millionaires to fund the measures. The article highlights that consumer spending, which accounts for around 70% of economic activity, slowed down during the second quarter of the year, along with automobile sales and spending on durable goods.

It can dramatically impact an individual's self-esteem and, in some cases, their quality of life. Regardless of the cause, be it genetic, hormonal, or stress-related, taking practical steps to confront and cope with the reality of hair loss can help individuals to regain control of their self-image and improve their well-being. By seeking medical advice, embracing acceptance, raising social awareness, and fostering community and communication, people can better equip themselves to navigate the challenges associated with hair loss.  1. Seek Medical Assistance: Consultation is Key One of the most important steps in addressing hair loss is to schedule a visit with a healthcare professional, such as a dermatologist or trichologist. Seeking guidance from a doctor will help identify the underlying cause of the hair loss and provide appropriate treatment options. Moreover, doctors may recommend lifestyle modifications, over-the-counter medications, or specialized treatments that can help slow hair loss or even promote regrowth. In some circumstances, hair loss might be indicative of a more serious health issue, so it is vital not to ignore the signs. Consultation with a professional is crucial in ensuring proper care and support. 2. Embrace Being Bald: Acceptance and Self-Love Acceptance plays a crucial role in coping with any change, especially when it concerns our physical appearance. Embracing baldness can be an empowering exercise in self-acceptance, allowing individuals to redefine their aesthetic and communicate confidence.  Acknowledging and embracing one's hair loss can also help minimize feelings of stigma or embarrassment. It is important to remember that hair does not define an individual's worth; self-worth is shaped by one's actions, values, and relationships. The journey to acceptance might involve trying out new hairstyles, investing in hats and scarves, or even adopting a clean-shaven look. Exploring new ways to embrace one's appearance can encourage a positive outlook and improve overall mental and emotional well-being. 3. Be Aware of Social Stigmas: Advocating for Positive Change Hair loss, particularly in women, can attract unwanted attention and stigmatization. Society often equates a full head of hair with youth, beauty, and vitality. To combat this harmful stereotype, it is essential to raise awareness about the various aspects of hair loss. Sharing personal stories and educating others about the realities and misconceptions behind the condition can contribute to a more understanding and inclusive environment. Social media platforms and blogs offer excellent avenues for advocacy and awareness, allowing individuals to engage in a broader dialogue surrounding this issue. By doing so, those experiencing hair loss can simultaneously destigmatize the condition while promoting informed conversations within their social circles. 4. Joining a Support Group: The Power of Shared Experiences Becoming part of a support group offers invaluable benefits to those coping with hair loss. These groups provide an empathetic environment where individuals can express their fears, frustrations, and triumphs with others who share similar experiences. Support groups facilitate emotional healing and offer a sense of unity among members. It is within these safe spaces that individuals can share coping strategies, offer encouragement, and draw strength from one another. The collective support found in groups can significantly improve the emotional well-being of those grappling with hair loss. 5. Communicate with People: Creating Understanding and Connection Open and honest communication is vital when coping with the emotional impact of hair loss. By expressing oneself to friends, family, or even colleagues, people can foster mutual understanding and empathy within their relationships.  Discussing the experience of hair loss can also be an educational moment for others, as individuals share the challenges they face. Moreover, communication can foster meaningful connections that enrich personal relationships and enable others to provide much-needed support and understanding. Conclusion Hair loss can undoubtedly be a challenging experience to go through. However, by seeking medical assistance, embracing self-acceptance, raising social awareness, joining support groups, and engaging in open communication, individuals can transform these challenges into opportunities for growth and self-discovery. The journey to reclaiming self-confidence and self-love begins with understanding, support, and unity, and together, we can foster a more inclusive and empathetic world for those who experience hair loss."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Five of the most important scrolls can now be seen in high-resolution on the internet. Users can zoom in and out, translate passages to English and access supplemental material.      The scrolls were written from about 200 BC to 70 AD and according Jeffrey L. Rubenstein, professor of Talmud and Rabbinics at New York University, they offer an unrivaled look at the time after the biblical books were penned and before the Christian texts and documents of rabbinic Judaism were written.      “The Dead Sea scrolls help us fill in this two to three century gap to help us understand what religious developments took place,” said Rubenstein. “We see changes among different groups as they wrestle with powerful cultural and political forces. … These changes help us understand where monotheistic traditions in the west came from.”      Custodians of the scrolls had been criticized for only allowing select groups of scholars access to them.      The original scrolls are located in a specially designed vault in Jerusalem that requires multiple keys, a magnetic card and a secret code to open.

Answer: Many states share a common system of license classes, with some exceptions, and commercial license classes are standardized by federal regulation at 49 CFR part 383. Question: what is a class c driver's license","output":"A Class C driver's license is a type of non-commercial driver's license commonly issued in many states across the United States. While the licensing system may vary slightly between states, the basic idea of a Class C license is generally similar nationwide. A Class C license authorizes the holder to operate vehicles that do not fit within the Class A or Class B driver's license categories. This type of license is intended for individuals who drive a wide range of passenger and lighter-duty vehicles for personal use or work-related purposes. Class C driver's licenses typically cover the operation of vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of less than 26,001 pounds, as long as the vehicle is not designed to transport 16 or more passengers (including the driver) or used for transporting hazardous materials.  Some common examples of vehicles that a person with a Class C license can operate include: 1. Automobiles and small trucks used for personal transportation or general-purpose transportation of goods. 2. Recreational vehicles (RVs) or motorhomes that are not considered commercial vehicles and are used primarily for personal use. 3. Certain vans, minivans, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) intended for the transportation of passengers or cargo, depending on their GVWR and capacity. 4. Smaller passenger vehicles for hire, such as taxis, that do not seat more than 15 passengers (including the driver). In addition to the standard Class C license, some states may also issue specialized \\"Class C Commercial\\" or \\"Class C Non-Commercial\\" licenses, tailored for specific uses, such as school buses or ambulances. These special endorsements often require additional testing and qualifications. In order to obtain a Class C driver's license, applicants must meet specific age requirements and pass both a written knowledge test and a behind-the-wheel driving test. Depending on the state's regulations, there may be additional required elements, such as driver's education, a vision test, or a medical examination. It is important to note that individual state laws and requirements can vary, so for the most accurate and up-to-date information about the licensing process and classification system in a specific state, it is recommended that individuals consult their local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or comparable state agency."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"When the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, Tennessee was mostly held by Union forces.

Upon closer inspection, the area in which these people are laboring seems to be the site of an ambitious construction project. The hum of heavy machinery and the buzz of power tools punctuate the atmosphere with a chaotic melody. Men with hard hats haul steel rebar and massive beams while a cluster of electricians string up miles of wiring to provide essential energy to the growing structure. Amidst this hive of activity is a crew working diligently to prepare the ground for the erection of a massive structure. They break the earth with shovels, diligently sifting through the soil to clear away stones and debris. Teamwork and communication are essential as they carve out a solid foundation upon which the impending structure will find stability and strength.

Interestingly, this acts as a stark contrast to the bustling efforts of the workers and emphasizes the importance of their mission.

Answer based on context: Under the leadership of Donia , they employed guerrilla tactics and achieved several victories such as the successful siege of two Hollandic castles and the city of Medemblik. Donia also targeted ships that travelled the Zuiderzee and was very active in 1517, when he used his \\"signal ships\\" to attack ships in the region of the West Frisian coast, to which he also transported Geldrian forces, from the Duthcy of Geldern, setting them ashore at Medemblik. Donia bore a personal enmity to Medemblik and its inhabitants as, in earlier years, soldiers from Medemblik had cooperated with the Dutch army commanded by Duke Charles, the future Emperor. Donia sank 28 Dutch ships, earning him the title \\"Cross of the Dutchmen\\". The rebels also received financial support from Charles II, Duke of Guelders, who claimed the Duchy of Guelders in opposition to the House of Habsburg. Charles also employed mercenaries under the command of Maarten van Rossum in their support. However, when the tides turned against the rebels after 1520, Charles withdrew his support. Losing their financial support, the rebels could then no longer afford to pay their mercenary army. About the same time, the Arumer Zwarte Hoop also lost their leader. In 1519, Donia's health deteriorated. He retired to his farm where he died in 1520. He is buried in Sneek in the 15th-century Groote Kerk .

One evening after giving a speech about the purity ring worn by members of the group, she is introduced to Tobey (Hale Appleman) and finds him attractive. The four begin going out as a group. Dawn has fantasies about marrying Tobey, although after acknowledging the attraction, they agree that they cannot spend time together. Soon after they give in and meet at a local swimming hole. After swimming together, they go into a cave to get warm and begin kissing. Dawn gets uncomfortable and tries to get them to go back. Tobey then attempts to rape Dawn, who panics and tries to push him off. Tobey becomes aggressive and shakes Dawn, resulting in her smacking her head on the ground. While she is dazed, Tobey takes the opportunity to begin raping her. Dawn fights back and inadvertently bites off his penis with her vagina. A horrified Dawn stumbles away and she flees the scene.

In my first year out of high school in college, I didn’t quite get along with one vocal pipsqueak of a guy. Mid-year one afternoon post-dismissal, a small white car drove past dangerously close to me and honked as I made my way to the bus stand home. If there had actually been any malice intended, I would have been caught out totally by surprise. The next day, he wondered aloud why I did not respond or react to him flippantly wanting to ram me with his car as he drove by. To think of it, I had already taken a swipe at another guy whom I suspected of being behind the wheel less than an hour earlier. Professing some half-hearted disinterest, I thought and felt to myself that this episode wasn’t over - yet. Fast forward some 45–60 days later, this guy is suddenly absent from college for almost a week. Successive class lecturers note that it is not like him to skip classes without a valid reason. Late on the second day of absence, another lecturer asks our class about him. “His car crashed.”, I state almost flippantly, with a weak spirit of retribution shining inside my gut. But as you would realize from answering this question it later turned out to be true. While driving at quite a clip near his home, he had barreled through a residential cross-junction and broadsided a delivery van that had charged through the open junction with no regulating traffic lights. The van ended up upside down on the road shoulder and his parents-issued car was out of commission for like, three weeks. He suffered a concussion and a shattered nasal septum from the impact and police issued the van driver a ticket for dangerous driving. Basically, he had joked about striking me with his car hit-and-run and I had later joked to that lecturer and the class that he had crashed his car - and it turned out I was right.

Q:I can use this background: Consider the antlers of the Irish elk, (often supposed to be far too large; in deer antler size has an allometric relationship to body size). Obviously, antlers serve positively for defence against predators, and to score victories in the annual rut. But they are costly in terms of resource. Their size during the last glacial period presumably depended on the relative gain and loss of reproductive capacity in the population of elks during that time. As another example, camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid coloration is displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the necessity for reproduction.Stream-dwelling salamanders, such as Caucasian salamander or Gold-striped salamander have very slender, long bodies, perfectly adapted to life at the banks of fast small rivers and mountain brooks. Elongated body protects their larvae from being washed out by current. However, elongated body increases risk of desiccation and decreases dispersal ability of the salamanders; it also negatively affects their fecundity. As a result, fire salamander, less perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats, is in general more successful, have a higher fecundity and broader geographic range.  Now, I have a new situation: John is a biologist. Last summer, he was studying the evolution of two different salamander species, species A and species B. Species A salamander was Gold-striped salamander while species B salamander was fire salamander. He found it interesting that they took different approaches to adapt to different habitats.  Answer this question please: Which species would be more successful in reproduction, Species A or species B? A:","output":"Species B, the fire salamander, would be more successful in reproduction. This is because, as mentioned in the background, the fire salamander is generally more successful, has a higher fecundity (reproductive capacity), and a broader geographic range. Despite not being as perfectly adapted to the mountain brook habitats like species A (Gold-striped salamander), their adaptability and higher reproductive rates give them an advantage in overall reproductive success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.  Paragraph: Pam and Ellie are two entomologists. they are both studying ants at the moment: Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, while Pam is studying ants that farm aphids.

Hypothesis: there was a coalition in 1990","output":"Based on the given paragraph, the hypothesis that there was a coalition in 1990 appears to be true. The paragraph states that \\"in 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.\\" According to this statement, a coalition was indeed formed during this time to address the issue of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. In order to provide a more detailed understanding, it is essential to have some background knowledge of the events that took place in 1990. In August of that year, Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, invaded and occupied Kuwait, which led to the Gulf War. The reason behind the invasion was a combination of economic issues, border disputes, and ambitions for regional dominance on the part of Iraq. As a response to this military aggression, the United Nations (UN) immediately condemned the invasion and imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Additionally, the UN called upon member states to take necessary actions to bring an end to the occupation. This led to a broad and diverse coalition of more than 30 countries, led predominantly by the United States, to come together to liberate Kuwait. The coalition included nations from the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. Its primary objective was to force the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and reestablish the country's sovereignty. The coalition achieved its goal through Operation Desert Storm, carried out from January 17, 1991, to February 28, 1991. The operation consisted of an intensive air campaign followed by a swift and decisive ground assault that led to the liberation of Kuwait and the expulsion of Iraqi forces. Given this historical context, it can be concluded that the hypothesis stating that there was a coalition in 1990 is indeed true. The coalition played a critical role in the military efforts to end Iraq's illegal occupation of Kuwait and restore sovereignty to the Kuwaiti people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I had turned them off when I passed another car and had forgotten to turn them back on . That could have bought me another millisecond . Answer the following question: What may be the reason for the outcome ?","output":"There could be several reasons for the outcome mentioned, which appears to involve a driving situation where the individual may have experienced a near miss or an incident due to not having their high beams on. Here are some potential reasons for the outcome: 1. Reduced Visibility: The primary function of high beams is to enhance visibility during nighttime driving, particularly in areas with poor lighting or at greater distances. By not turning the high beams back on after passing another car, the driver may have experienced reduced visibility, making it difficult to see potential road hazards, obstacles, or other vehicles in time to react effectively. 2. Limited Reaction Time: In driving situations where visibility is limited, every millisecond counts. The driver mentioned that having high beams on could have \\"bought them another millisecond,\\" suggesting that their reaction time may have been insufficient to respond to whatever situation they encountered. The additional lighting provided by high beams could have allowed the driver to perceive and react to the situation more quickly, potentially preventing an incident. 3. Cognitive Overload: When driving, it is crucial to be continually aware of your vehicle's functions and to manage multiple variables simultaneously, such as navigating traffic, obeying speed limits, and monitoring your vehicle's systems. Forgetting to reengage the high beams after passing another vehicle could be an example of cognitive overload, where the driver momentarily lost track of this important aspect of their driving. This oversight may have contributed to the outcome by leaving them unprepared for a situation requiring greater visibility. 4. Poor Road Conditions: If the incident occurred in an area with poorly maintained roads or where the lack of proper street lighting made it difficult for the driver to see clearly, not having high beams on could have exacerbated the situation. Relying solely on low beams in such conditions may not provide sufficient light to safely navigate the road, increasing the likelihood of an incident. 5. Inexperience or Fatigue: It is possible that the driver's level of experience or their physical and mental state at the time may have played a role in the outcome. An inexperienced driver might not be as adept at managing multiple aspects of driving, while a tired or fatigued driver might be more prone to make mistakes, such as forgetting to turn their high beams back on. In summary, the outcome likely resulted from a combination of factors, including reduced visibility due to not utilizing high beams, limited reaction time, cognitive overload or oversight, poor road conditions, as well as the driver's experience and fatigue level. Each of these factors may have contributed to the situation where the driver barely avoided or encountered an incident. Utilizing high beams when necessary and being aware of one's surroundings can help prevent similar outcomes in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. The writer's search for the right shampoo probably has lasted: - for months - not enough information - for years - for weeks","output":"The writer's search for the right shampoo appears to have lasted for years. As mentioned in the text, they first tried Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked back in 2013. Since then, they have tried numerous SLS-free haircare products with varying levels of success, and they have continued searching for the best natural, non-irritating options that can effectively cleanse and improve the condition of their hair. Throughout this journey, the writer experiences challenges in finding the perfect product that not only soothes their sensitive, itchy scalp but also cleanses their hair effectively, without leaving it greasy or lifeless. The Naked Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner they tested most recently has provided some relief to their scalp issues, but the problem with cleansing their hair efficiently still remains. Although their experimentation with the 'reverse poo' method has slightly improved the results, the writer still faces issues with hair tangling and is not fully satisfied with the outcome. This continuous search for a suitable SLS-free shampoo and conditioner demonstrates their dedication to finding and using haircare products that effectively address both their scalp sensitivity and hair care needs. It is evident that the process of finding the best shampoo for their specific hair requirements has been ongoing for an extended period, likely spanning over several years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – New Hampshire Republicans will have one less presidential candidate to consider: Rand Paul is dropping out of the race, reports CNN. The move comes after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, leaving the libertarian-leaning senator to focus instead on keeping his seat in Kentucky, where he faces a re-election challenge, reports Politico. \\"It's been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the White House,\\" Paul said in a statement cited by ABC News. \\"Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of liberty.\\" Read it in full here.","output":"Title: Rand Paul Steps Out of Presidential Race Following Poor Showing in Iowa Caucuses New Hampshire Republicans will now have one less presidential candidate to consider following the announcement that Rand Paul is dropping out of the race. The libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky decided to withdraw after a less-than-stellar performance in the Iowa caucuses. His departure leaves the remaining Republican candidates vying for the nomination and the support of the voters who once backed Paul. Although the senator has suspended his presidential campaign, he is now turning his attention towards keeping his Senate seat in Kentucky, where he faces a re-election challenge. Politico reports that Paul has put much of his financial and political capital into his presidential bid, leaving his re-election campaign more vulnerable than in the previous years. Moreover, this year's midterm elections have shaped up to be highly competitive, increasing the need for Paul to concentrate on the Senate race if he wants to retain his position in Congress. In a statement cited by ABC News, Paul expressed gratitude and a sense of accomplishment for having run a principled campaign for the White House. \\"It's been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the White House,\\" he said. \\"Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of liberty.\\" Rand Paul's departure from the presidential race marks the end of his quest to transform the Republican Party with his unique blend of small government ideology, libertarian principles, and anti-interventionist foreign policy views. Paul had managed to build a solid base of supporters, but the rise of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, along with the resurgent popularity of libertarian and economically conservative principles, contributed to the senator's struggle to break into the top tier of GOP candidates. During his presidential campaign, Paul aimed to expand the Republican base by reaching out to younger voters, minorities, and those who felt disillusioned with the political establishment. Most notably, he advocated for criminal justice reform, NSA surveillance limitations, and a restrained foreign policy. While these positions did endear him to a segment of the electorate, it was not enough to secure him a leading position in the polls and the crowded Republican field. As Rand Paul bows out of the presidential race, those who once supported his bid must now seek out a new candidate to back. It remains to be seen which remaining Republican contender will successfully court the libertarian-leaning and discontented voters who once looked to Paul as their champion. It is possible that these voters may opt for Ted Cruz, who has also championed limited government and strict constitutionalism, or they might gravitate towards other candidates with similarly anti-establishment or fiscally conservative platforms. While Rand Paul's moment in the presidential spotlight has concluded, his impact on the Republican Party and the race for the White House cannot be underestimated. As he returns to the Senate to focus on his re-election campaign, the GOP field will continue to battle for the nomination and the loyalty of the voters who once supported the Kentucky senator. Whether his libertarian-leaning supporters will coalesce around a particular candidate or spread their allegiance among several contenders, Paul's departure from the race will certainly reshape the landscape of the 2016 election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last of the person who was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience?  Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression.

Start by selecting an appropriately sized cage that allows ample room for your parakeet to move around and spread its wings, while also ensuring that the cage bars are appropriately spaced to prevent injury or escape. The ideal cage should have a horizontal orientation with a minimum dimension of 24 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 18 inches high, and make sure to place it in a peaceful, well-lit area away from direct sunlight, drafts, and extreme temperature fluctuations. Equip the cage with several perches of varying sizes and materials to encourage foot exercise and prevent pressure sores. Include natural branches with various textures, rope perches, and smooth dowels for variety. Additionally, provide your parakeet with stimulating toys and accessories that cater to its innate curiosity and need for mental engagement, such as hanging toys, bells, ladders, and foraging toys. Rotate these toys frequently to maintain your bird's interest and promote interactive play. Cleanliness is essential to ensure the health and wellbeing of your parakeet. Regularly clean the cage, removing droppings, uneaten food, and other debris daily. Thoroughly scrub and disinfect the cage, perches, and accessories with a pet-safe cleaning solution on a weekly basis, and replace any damaged or worn items promptly. Parakeets, being social creatures, greatly benefit from consistent interaction with their human caregivers. Dedicate time each day to bond with your parakeet through gentle handling, play, and conversation. Familiarize yourself with their body language and signs of contentment or distress, and be attentive to their vocalizations. This will strengthen your bond and encourage positive behaviors, leading to a more rewarding companion relationship. Establishing a routine is crucial in managing your parakeet's overall health. This includes scheduling regular, quiet rest periods in the evenings and maintaining a consistent feeding regimen. Additionally, monitor your parakeet's health by checking for signs of illness, such as changes in appetite, energy levels, or feather condition. Consult with an avian veterinarian for routine health check-ups, vaccinations, and guidance on potential signs of sickness or injury. Owning a parakeet comes with the responsibility of providing the best care possible for your feathered companion. With proper nutrition, regular socialization, diligent hygiene, and a safe, comfortable living environment, your parakeet will flourish and thrive, offering you a rewarding and enriching partnership as you share your lives together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to when did canada and the us become allies??","output":"Canada and the United States have a long history of collaboration dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. However, the relationship only became a formal alliance following World War II. To fully understand when Canada and the US became allies, it is essential to consider significant events in their shared history and various milestones that have solidified their diplomatic relations. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the relationship between Canada and the US was tumultuous marked by conflicts such as the War of 1812. Following the end of this war, the Treaty of Ghent was signed in 1814, which laid the foundation for improved relations between the two nations. After the war, Canada and the US developed mutual interests in terms of trade, commerce, and peaceful coexistence. The Oregon Treaty of 1846, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842, and other subsequent agreements helped facilitate this process. Nevertheless, the two countries did not become formal allies until World War II, a period that significantly transformed their relationship. World War II marked the beginning of a more explicit strategic alliance. While Canada and the United States fought together against the Axis powers, it was not until the end of the war that their partnership was formalized. The true origins of their alliance can be traced back to the signing of the Charter of the United Nations in 1945, making both Canada and the United States founding members. Having collaborated in various international initiatives in the years that followed, they further solidified their alliance in 1949 with the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military alliance intended to counterbalance the power of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Another pivotal moment in their relationship came in 1957 through the signing of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) agreement, a joint defense pact between Canada and the United States, aimed at defending North American airspace. This pact demonstrated their commitment to working together in matters of military importance and continental defense. The collaboration between Canada and the US has only grown stronger in subsequent decades, and their relationship now encompasses political, economic, military, social, and cultural cooperation. This partnership is also reinforced by the vast number of agreements and institutions they share – including trade agreements like the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement (1988) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA, now USMCA) implemented in 1994. In summary, while the roots of cooperation between Canada and the United States can be traced back to the early 19th century, they did not become formal allies until the post-World War II era with the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945. The relationship was further cemented with their joint membership in NATO in 1949 and the establishment of NORAD in 1957. Today, the Canada-US alliance is a strong and multifaceted partnership encompassing various aspects of international affairs, from defense and trade to cultural exchanges and environmental cooperation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Gather the ingredients for the cake - Mix the flour, sugar, egg, and water to make batter - Pour the mixture into a cake pan - Place the cake in the oven to cook - Take the cake out when it is cooked through - Let the cake cool - Serve the cake -   Question: suppose a dense cake is required happens, how will it affect less flour is used.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"Using less flour in the cake recipe will result in a cake with a less dense texture. This is because flour plays a significant role in providing structure to the cake. Reducing the amount of flour will cause the cake to have a lighter and less stable structure. In the process you provided, the second effect mentioned is the mixture of flour, sugar, egg, and water to make the batter. A decrease in the amount of flour used will have an effect on this step. It will result in a thinner, less viscous batter. This change in batter consistency will ultimately influence the final texture of the cake, making it less dense. In conclusion, using less flour will have a \\"less\\" effect on the second effect mentioned, as the batter will be thinner and result in a less dense cake."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer: The Royalists advanced as far as Redbridge, Southampton, in March 1644 but were prevented from taking the town.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"The Royalists, led by King Charles I, failed to take Redbridge, Southampton, in March 1644 during the English Civil War (1642-1651). The war was fought by the Royalists, who supported King Charles I, and the Parliamentarians, who favored a more prominent role for the parliament in governing the nation, led by Oliver Cromwell. The English Civil War was a long and bloody conflict that was both politically and religiously driven. In 1644, the Royalists and the Parliamentarians were fighting for control over England, and the tide of the war was constantly shifting. In late 1643, King Charles I launched a campaign to regain control of the Southern and Western regions of England, which would ensure he had direct access to the important trading ports. The King's plan was to surround the Parliamentarian strongholds in between the Royalist-controlled territories. The campaign began with the Royalist force led by Prince Maurice, the King's nephew, moving to retake the South-Eastern port town of Redbridge. Redbridge was a strategic location, as it contained an important bridge that provided access to the Southampton port. In March 1644, the Royalists approached Redbridge, expecting to find an opportunity to take the town easily. However, the Parliamentarians, who were well-aware of the strategic importance of Redbridge, had fortified the town with a strong garrison. Under the command of Captain Richard Norton, they prepared themselves to defend the town against a much larger and better-equipped Royalist force. As the Royalist forces approached, Norton ordered his men to create barricades by felling trees and piling earth across the approach routes to Redbridge. They set up guard posts at key points to monitor the Royalist's movements and strengthen their defenses. As the Royalists got closer, they were met with a barrage of gunfire from the barricaded Parliamentarians. Realizing that Redbridge was far more prepared for battle than previously assumed, the Royalist forces hesitated to mount a full-scale assault on the town. They opted for a more cautious approach, trying to analyze the strength and disposition of the defender's position. Meanwhile, the defenders continued to harass and repel the Royalist force's attempts to encircle the town. Despite several skirmishes and probing attacks, the Royalists were unable to break through the staunch defenses of Redbridge. Eventually, their attempts to capture the town proved futile, and Prince Maurice decided to withdraw his forces and focus on other targets. The failure to take Redbridge hindered King Charles I's plan to reestablish control over Southern England, and it was seen as a significant setback for the Royalists. In conclusion, the Royalists failed to take Redbridge, Southampton, in March 1644, due to the strong Parliamentarian defense and the determination of Captain Richard Norton and his men to protect the town. This event was part of the larger and tumultuous English Civil War, demonstrating the strategic importance of even small towns and the impact they could have on the overall outcome of the conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What is named after a fruit?\\"  Context: \\"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Kiwi - Kiwi is a fruit and also the name of a flightless bird species native to New Zealand. In the given context, kiwi is mentioned as an exception among the Palaeognathae with regard to possessing a penis. This is a case in which both a bird and a fruit share the same name."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A: Answer:","output":"A: Gills The part of a fish that helps them breathe is called gills. Fish possess a specialized respiratory system that is different from those of terrestrial animals. Gills play a crucial role in extracting dissolved oxygen from the surrounding water and expelling waste gases such as carbon dioxide from the fish's body. Below is a detailed explanation of how gills function and the role they play in the respiration process in fish. Gills are located on both sides of a fish's body, right behind the head and beneath the operculum, a bony flap that covers and protects the delicate gill tissues. Each side generally contains four gill arches, which support the gill filaments. These filaments consist of thousands of tiny, thin-walled structures called lamellae, which significantly increase the surface area available for gas exchange. The process of respiration begins when a fish opens its mouth and takes in water. This water then flows over the gills, where the dissolved oxygen it contains diffuses into the fish's bloodstream through the walls of the lamellae. Simultaneously, waste carbon dioxide diffuses out of the fish's bloodstream and into the water, which is then expelled as the fish closes its mouth and forces the water out through the gill slits. Several factors contribute to the efficiency of this gas exchange in gills, one of which is the countercurrent exchange mechanism. In this process, the flow of water over the gills occurs in the opposite direction of blood flow within the gill lamellae. This enables fish to extract a greater percentage of dissolved oxygen from the water than if the two fluids were to flow in the same direction. The countercurrent exchange system helps fish to breathe more efficiently even in low-oxygen environments. Moreover, the thinness of the gill lamellae walls allows for efficient gas exchange. The walls of the lamellae are only a few cell layers thick, which speeds up the rate at which oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse through them. In summary, the gills are the specialized respiratory structures in fish that help them breathe underwater. They are located behind the head and beneath the operculum, and are composed of gill arches, filaments, and lamellae that facilitate efficient gas exchange. Water passes over the gills and provides dissolved oxygen while removing waste carbon dioxide, allowing fish to survive and thrive in their aquatic environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They were just married and were very excited to spend some special time together. But something sad happened during their trip. Michaela was found hurt and she couldn't be saved. Everybody in Mauritius and back home was very shocked and sad about what happened to Michaela. Many people from Mauritius and Michaela's home country wanted to find out who had done this to her and make sure they are punished. A lot of work has been done since then to find the person who hurt Michaela but nobody has been found yet. Even after six whole years, John, who is now a brave and strong man, didn't give up hope. He knew he needed to do something about it. So, he planned a trip back to Mauritius, the island where he lost his dear wife. This time, he went not for fun, but to make sure that everybody still remembers what happened to Michaela and to keep trying to find who did this to her. John met many important people in Mauritius, including their leader, the prime minister! They talked about Michaela and how important it was to keep looking for the person who hurt her. The prime minister was very kind and understanding. He promised that they would keep working hard on the case to make sure justice is served. John didn't only meet important people during his visit, but also many good-hearted people who lived in Mauritius. They showed him support, love, and kindness. They wanted him to know that they, too, were very sad about what happened to Michaela, and they still remembered her even after all these years. These new friendships gave John hope that someday, they would find the person responsible and make sure they are punished for their actions. So, boys and girls, this story is all about hope, friendship, and never giving up. Even when things seem impossible and many years have passed, we must always remember to have hope, to keep on trying, and to cherish the kindness of people we meet along the way. Just like John, we can keep moving forward, making new friendships, fighting for justice, and finding hope in the darkest of times.

Question: Title: Should've bought Ying-Yang. Product review: The cd was just okay. I'm from Chicago and I love house music but this was kinda lame. A lot of the songs sound alike but the bass is booming! I'm a dancer and I can only use about 3 of the 12 tracks. I'm glad it didn't cost a lot. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"The review provided for the \\"Ying-Yang\\" CD product can be seen as one that depicts the product in an overall unflattering light. While there are a few positive aspects mentioned, the reviewer expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with various facets of the product. Let's break down the specific points that contribute to this unflattering portrayal. 1. The reviewer begins by stating that the CD is \\"just okay,\\" which implies that it is not particularly impressive or worth getting excited about. This lukewarm sentiment sets the tone for the rest of the review, as the reviewer shares more critical opinions about the product. 2. As someone from Chicago who loves house music, the reviewer would be considered part of the target audience for this product. Their dissatisfaction with the album, therefore, carries more weight than it would if it came from someone who was not a fan of the genre. 3. The reviewer finds the CD \\"kinda lame\\" and comments that \\"a lot of the songs sound alike.\\" These remarks point to a perceived lack of originality, creativity, and diversity in the tracks. This is a major aspect that contributes to the overall unflattering portrayal of the product. 4. Although the bass is described as \\"booming,\\" this positive attribute is not enough to outweigh the other negative factors mentioned. It can be viewed as a silver lining, but it does not completely redeem the album in the eyes of the reviewer. 5. The fact that the reviewer can only use three out of twelve tracks for dancing further highlights their disappointment. This suggests that only a small portion of the product meets their needs and expectations, which is certainly not flattering. 6. Lastly, the reviewer is glad the CD did not cost a lot, implying that it may not have been worth the investment if it were more expensive. This statement reinforces the idea that the quality and enjoyment factor of the product might not be up to par. In conclusion, this product review largely depicts the Ying-Yang CD in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses various points of dissatisfaction and disappointment, which far outweigh the limited positive comments mentioned. As a result, potential buyers may be discouraged by this portrayal and might not consider purchasing this CD—an outcome that is not flattering for the product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Johnny Depp earned two nominations, as best musical or comedy actor for \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"The Tourist.\\"      Along with Eisenberg, Firth and Wahlberg, best dramatic actor contenders are James Franco for the survival story \\"127 Hours\\" and Ryan Gosling for the marital tale \\"Blue Valentine.\\"      Nominees for best dramatic actress are Halle Berry for the multiple-personality drama \\"Frankie and Alice,\\" Nicole Kidman for the grieving-parent tale \\"Rabbit Hole,\\" Jennifer Lawrence for the Ozarks crime yarn \\"Winter's Bone,\\" Natalie Portman for \\"Black Swan\\" and Michelle Williams for \\"Blue Valentine.\\"      Along with Fincher and Russell, directing nominees are Darren Aronofsky for \\"Black Swan,\\" Tom Hooper for \\"The King's Speech\\" and Christopher Nolan for \\"Inception.\\"      Nolan's sci-fi hit also earned nominations for screenplay and musical score, but its cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio, was snubbed for acting slots.

But the Globes have provided murky forecasts in recent times. In the last six years, only a single recipient of one of the Globe best-film prizes has gone on to win best picture at the Oscars _ 2008's \\"Slumdog Millionaire.\\"      That came after a stretch of eight-straight years when a Globe winner in either the dramatic or musical-comedy category went on to claim the best-picture Oscar.      Like the Globes, the Oscars will feature 10 best-picture nominees, but in a single category, after academy overseers doubled the number of contenders so a broader range of films could compete.      With two acclaimed dramas _ \\"The King's Speech\\" and \\"The Social Network\\" _ considered front-runners this time, there are prospects of another divergent year between the Globes and the Oscars, whose nominations come out Jan. 25, nine days after the Globes are presented.      \\"The Social Network\\" already has snagged two key prizes as both Los Angeles and New York film critics groups picked it as the year's best movie. The National Board of Review, a group of film historians, educators and students, also picked \\"The Social Network\\" as best of the year.      The Globes and Oscars typically line up better on acting winners. Last year, \\"Avatar\\" won best drama at the Globes and \\"The Hurt Locker\\" took best picture at the Oscars. But all four Oscar acting recipients _ Sandra Bullock for \\"The Blind Side,\\" Jeff Bridges for \\"Crazy Heart,\\" Mo'Nique for \\"Precious\\" and Christoph Waltz for \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" _ also won prizes at the Globes first.      Clear favorites have emerged this season for best actor (Firth in \\"The King's Speech\\") and supporting actor (Bale in \\"The Fighter\\").      Bening for \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" and Portman for \\"Black Swan\\" could wind up in a two-woman race for best actress at the Oscars, while the supporting-actress category is up for grabs among prospects that include Adams and Leo for \\"The Fighter,\\" Bonham Carter for \\"The King's Speech\\" and 14-year-old newcomer Hailee Steinfeld for \\"True Grit.\\"      No matter how the two awards shows line up on winners, the stars generally can count on a good time at the Globes, a more laid-back, dinner-and-drinks affair than the stately Oscars.      The Globes are presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 85 critics and reporters for overseas outlets.      Robert De Niro, an eight-time Globe nominee who won a best-actor prize there for \\"Raging Bull,\\" will receive the group's Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement.

The Obamas arrive at Martha's Vineyard on Sunday. The first family, along with Obama's sister Maya Soetoro-Ng and the first dog Bo, arrived on the Massachusetts island Sunday. The Obamas are staying at a secluded 28-acre private estate. The No. 1 priority on Obama's vacation agenda is \\"To get a little break,\\" White House spokesman Bill Burton said Monday. \\"He certainly appreciates the hospitality of the folks who are here. But his desire here is to relax and spend time with the family.\\" The president waved to the crowd that had gathered to watch him tee off, and a little boy was heard yelling, \\"Hi,","output":"Mr. President!\\" as Obama smiled and gave a friendly nod in response. After greeting onlookers, he turned his attention back to his family, who were enjoying the beautiful Martha's Vineyard weather and the picturesque surroundings. Malia and Sasha, taking a break from their school responsibilities, were seen playing with their cousin and laughing heartily, while Michelle engaged in conversation with her sister-in-law Maya. Even Bo, the first dog, appeared to be thoroughly enjoying his time on the island, sniffing around the lush greenery and wagging his tail contentedly. The secluded estate provided the tranquility that the Obamas sought, allowing them the opportunity to connect with nature and engage in some of their favorite leisure activities. Bike rides along the charming island paths, morning jogs through the woods, and quality time spent by the water were all a part of the family's schedule during their stay. Aware of the importance of recuperation, the president did not forget to indulge in self-care, taking moments for mindful reflection and alternating between engrossing fiction novels and enlightening nonfiction reads. Although work was never far from President Obama's mind, the vacation allowed for a much-needed reprieve from the stress and demands of the office. Throughout the course of the week, the president was seen in a more laid-back, casual attire, swapping his usual tailored suits for shorts and polo shirts. He also used the opportunity to catch up with close friends, sharing laughs and reminiscing about their past experiences together. Inevitably, the Obamas' Martha's Vineyard vacation also attracted attention from both the media and island visitors, but even the presence of paparazzi and curious tourists did not seem to intrude greatly on their quality time. Camera lenses might have been documenting their every move, but the family's focus remained on enjoying each other's company and creating lasting memories. As their week away from the hectic world of politics drew to a close, the Obamas prepared to return to the White House, recharged and ready to face the challenges ahead. The family would no doubt cherish the time they spent on Martha's Vineyard, not only for the relief it provided from their day-to-day obligations but also for the setting it offered to strengthen their family bond. The powerful impact of President Obama's vacation demonstrated that even the leader of the free world requires an occasional break to relax and rejuvenate, and his dedication to spending quality time with his family served as an example for many to follow."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Torricelli later realized this and thought, \\"Hmm, if air can push juice into a straw, then maybe we can use it to measure the air's push (or pressure)!\\" So, Torricelli used Galileo's wrong idea about suction pumps to come up with a cool new instrument, called a barometer, that measures how strong the air is pushing.

An official with the Vatican criticized the decision to award the Nobel prize for medicine to British doctor Robert G.

Ignazio Carrasco de Paula, president of the Pontifical Academy for Life, said giving the award to Edwards was \\"completely inappropriate,\\" according to the news agency. He said Edwards' work had created a market for human eggs and created problems of embryos being frozen, the news agency said.

Which person learned less about carbon dioxide clouds?  Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead!

Mine was junk. Is this product review negative?","output":"Yes, this product review can be considered negative for several reasons. Let's analyze each part of the review to understand why it has been classified as negative: 1. Title: \\"cheap junk\\" The title itself is a clear indicator that the reviewer is not satisfied with the product. The word \\"cheap\\" often implies a lower quality, while \\"junk\\" means something that is useless or worthless. This combination of words already sets a negative tone for the entire review. 2. \\"This is the type of product where you either get lucky and it works correctly, or you don't an it's completely useless.\\" In this first sentence, the reviewer describes the product as unreliable and that its functionality solely depends on luck. The fact that the reviewer sees this as a game of chance suggests that there are too many inconsistencies in the product's performance, which is not favorable for the buyer or user. 3. \\"Mine was junk.\\" This statement clarifies the reviewer's personal experience with the product, in which they were evidently unlucky and found the product to be \\"junk.\\" This further emphasizes their dissatisfaction and the overall negative impression of the product. 4. The lack of positive comments The review, as a whole, does not express any positive points or compliments about the product. This is another reinforcing factor, highlighting the negative nature of the review. In conclusion, this product review can undoubtedly be deemed negative due to the choice of words and phrases that express dissatisfaction and disappointment. The reviewer not only finds the product to be of poor quality but also perceives it as unreliable—two major factors that contribute to a negative perception of any product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the USA, if you travel inland from Oregon, or Washington, which state do you enter?","output":"If you travel inland from Oregon or Washington in the United States, you will enter the state of Idaho. Idaho is located to the east of both Oregon and Washington and serves as a natural geographic transition zone as you move away from the Pacific coast. Oregon, Washington, and Idaho are all part of the Pacific Northwest region in the United States, which is known for its diverse ecosystems, including lush forests, rugged coastline, and arid deserts. The Pacific Northwest is celebrated for its natural beauty, outdoor recreation opportunities, and relatively mild climate. Oregon is situated to the south of Washington and shares a 206-mile (332 km) border with Idaho. The Snake River, which originates in Wyoming and flows westward through Idaho, forms a major section of the border between Oregon and Idaho. As you move inland from Oregon's beautiful coastline, you will pass through diverse terrain, including the Cascade Range, a volcanic mountain range that stretches from British Columbia through Washington, Oregon, and into Northern California. Washington, located to the north of Oregon, shares a 480-mile (772 km) border with Idaho. Like Oregon, Washington also transitions through a variety of ecosystems as you move eastward from its scenic Pacific coastline, such as the temperate rainforests of the Olympic Peninsula, the high peaks of the Cascade Range, and the drier, semi-arid Columbia Plateau. Upon entering Idaho, you will find a state that is predominantly mountainous, with diverse geology and ecosystems owing to its situation along the Continental Divide. Idaho is home to a variety of landscapes, from the fertile agricultural fields of the Snake River Plain in the southern part of the state to the dense forests and mountain ranges in the north. Some notable features include Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in North America, and a portion of the iconic Yellowstone National Park. In summary, if you travel inland from Oregon or Washington in the United States, you will enter the state of Idaho, which provides a varied and striking natural landscape in the Pacific Northwest region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This was awful for Stan, just awful. He had loved Sheila for a long time, fought for her heart, believed in their love until finally she had come around. They were about to kiss for the first time and then this: yellow gumballs. Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila.

Question: What is the answer for the question: Who did Joe Denton give a ride to? from the following article ?  Joe Denton, a corrupt ex-cop, is released from jail. Six years earlier, while on the mob's payroll, Denton attacked district attorney Phil Coakley, earning him the enmity of the police and the nickname \\"slash cop\\". After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink.  His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey.  At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse. Denton smoothly thanks her for her work and leaves the house, where he encounters Vassey's sadistic son, Junior. Junior threatens to kill Denton, enraged that Vassey would see him while avoiding his own son.

First, let's put together all the n's (like if you have apples, you just add apples together!): 38*n - 9*n - 20*n = 38 apples - 9 apples - 20 apples = (38 - 9 - 20) apples = 9 apples So now we have 9*n.

So, let's move -180 to the other side. To do that, we add 180 to both sides: 9*n = 180 Now we have to find out what n is. It's like asking, \\"there are 9 buckets and in total, they have 180 apples, so how many apples are in each bucket?\\" To find that out, we just divide the total apples (180) by the number of buckets (9): n = 180 ÷ 9 n = 20 So, n is 20! That means each bucket has 20 apples. Good job, kiddo!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person Black Francis told he was keen to record again? from the following article ?  While the Pixies' 1991 album Trompe le Monde was being recorded, Thompson had discussions with the album's producer, Gil Norton, about a possible solo record. He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a cover album. However, by the time Thompson visited a recording studio again in 1992, he had \\"plenty of tunes and musical scraps.\\"He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, The Beach Boys' \\"Hang On to Your Ego\\". Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs, with Santiago featuring on lead guitar and Nick Vincent on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name \\"Frank Black\\" (inverting his old persona \\"Black Francis\\") and released the results as Frank Black in March 1993. Frank Black was characterized by a focus on UFOs and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in \\"I Heard Ramona Sing\\", a song about the Ramones. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde. Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with Trompe le Monde, \\"but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did.\\"The following year, Black released his second solo record, a 22-song double album entitled Teenager of the Year. Teenager included the song \\"Headache\\" (sample ), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as \\"irresistible pop\\". The production of Teenager of the Year was markedly different from Frank Black; in the previous album, MIDI templates were used when writing songs, but in Teenager, Black showed individual parts to band members, the core of which included drummer Vincent and Lyle Workman on lead guitar. Feldman noted that Thompson's songwriting became \\"a lot more spontaneous\\" while recording the... The answer to this question is:","output":"Gil.

Q:Information:  - TK Records was an American independent record label founded by record distributor Henry Stone and Steve Alaimo in 1972. and based in Hialeah, Florida. The record label went bankrupt in 1981.  - Henry Stone ( June 3 , 1921 -- August 7 , 2014 ) , born Henry David Epstein , was an American record company executive and producer whose career spanned the era from R&B in the early 1950s through the disco boom of the 1970s to the 2010s . He was best known as co-owner and president of TK Records , but reportedly set up over 100 record labels , and was responsible for over 100 million record sales across the world . He was described as \`\` an acute businessman who always made sure that contracts and publishing agreements were written in his favor . ''  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise.  - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Steve Alaimo (born December 6, 1939) is an American singer who was a teen idol in the early 1960s. He later became record producer and label owner, but he is perhaps best known for hosting and co-producing Dick Clark's \\"Where the Action Is\\" in the late 1960s. He had nine singles to chart in the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 without once reaching the Top 40 in his career, the most by any artist.  - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.    'henry stone' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'occupation'?

Sentence: Emperor and Galilean has six acts.","output":"The sentence \\"Emperor and Galilean has six acts\\" is false. According to the provided text, the play \\"Emperor and Galilean\\" by Henrik Ibsen is split into two parts, with each part consisting of five acts. This structure denotes that the entirety of the play comprises ten acts in total, not six. Established on the context relayed in the text, the piece is indeed a significant and lengthy contribution to Ibsen's literary career, as it was expressly mentioned as his longest play.  It also vital to acknowledge that in the world of playwriting the structural design of the content often carries symbolic resonance to the overall narrative. By crafting the structure in this way, Ibsen may have sought to produce a perfect balance between two relative parts of the story, each carrying its own set of five acts.  This structure of ten acts shared between two parts is not common in the field of playwriting, where traditionally, plays consist of three or five acts.

Tornadoes have been documented in every U.S. state (not including the non-state territories of Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico) at least once since 1950, although some regions and states are hit by tornadoes far more than others. For example, the average number of tornadoes to hit the states of Alaska, Rhode Island, and Vermont is less than one, while the state of Oklahoma receives an average of 52 tornadoes per year, and the state of Texas is hit with 126 tornadoes in an average year. The state with the most tornadoes per unit area is Florida, though most are weak tornadoes of EF0 or EF1 intensity. A number of Florida's tornadoes occur along the edge of hurricanes that strike the state. The state with the highest number of strong tornadoes per unit area is Oklahoma. States such as Oklahoma and Kansas have much lower population densities than Florida, so tornadoes may go unreported. are there any states that don't have tornadoes?","output":"As mentioned earlier, tornadoes have been documented in every U.S. state at least once since 1950. However, some states experience them much less frequently than others. States such as Alaska, Rhode Island, and Vermont have an average of less than one tornado per year, making them the least tornado-prone states in the country. In Alaska's case, the cold climate makes the formation of tornadoes extremely rare. It is important to note that even in these states with very low tornado frequency, the possibility of a tornado occurring still exists, albeit at much lower likelihood than in more tornado-prone areas. Tornadoes occur more frequently in some regions than others due to differing atmospheric and geographical conditions. The most tornado-prone region in the United States is an area known as \\"Tornado Alley,\\" which includes parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Colorado, and even extending into parts of Iowa and Missouri. This region has the highest frequency of tornadoes due to the unique combination of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, cool, dry air from the Rocky Mountains and Canada, and strong upper-level winds, which create an environment conducive to the formation of powerful thunderstorms and tornadoes. In summary, while there are no U.S. states completely devoid of tornadoes, some states like Alaska, Rhode Island, and Vermont experience tornadoes very infrequently. However, it is essential to remain vigilant and be prepared for severe weather, as tornadoes can still occur even in those states with the lowest frequencies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bob's parents were in their early 60's. He sent them to the doctor's for a routine check up. Dan, his dad, had very high cholesterol, while Mary, his mom , had normal levels in her blood.  Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, it can be concluded that Dan, Bob's father, had more plaques that could potentially block blood flow. This is because Dan had very high cholesterol levels, while Mary, Bob's mother, had normal cholesterol levels in her blood. Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades, and it is a significant factor in the development of atherosclerosis.

Throughout the night, Oleg runs into many unsavory people, including a homeless man, a drug dealer, and an abusive pimp named Lester (David Warshofsky) and his prostitute, Divina (Idalis DeLeon). After saving Divina from Lester, she decides to help Oleg, which is how he winds up at the same diner that Joey and Nicky are at. Joey is there to talk to Frankie Perello (Arthur J. Nascarella), the Italian mob boss, about Oleg and to tell him that the gun Oleg used wasn't from the shootout. Nicky and Oleg stash the gun in the diner bathroom and when Oleg tries to flee, he is caught by the police and sent back into his stepfather's custody. When Anzor takes Oleg out for ice cream to get him to tell him where the gun is, Oleg eventually winds up in the apartment with two other children of a married couple, Dez (Bruce Altman) and Edele (Elizabeth Mitchell), who turn out to be serial killers who prey on...

Write a title for this article: An entire generation of NBA players learned this the hard way after Michael Jordan retired from the league in 1999: In few realms does the \\"tough act to follow\\" idiom ring more true than the noisy, hyper-scrutinized and testosterone-laden world of sports. Successors are examined, criticized and endlessly compared to the demigods who came before them. It's a trap, but one that can't be avoided. Steve Ballmer, however, is poised to experience the opposite effect. If and when — despite Donald Sterling's intention to sue the NBA for a 1 billion — he is eventually allowed to buy the Los Angeles Clippers for the whopping price tag of 2 billion, the former Microsoft CEO will be hailed as the sporting world's knight in shining armor, here to rescue a hamstrung franchise and outraged public from the ogre that is Sterling. The Clippers are our damsel in distress. Sterling is the tyrant holding her — and the sensibilities of decent Americans everywhere — hostage. That's after the qualities that made him reviled by NBA fans for decades were finally exposed to the general public thanks to a leaked recording of him making a string of racist comments. So Ballmer isn't just another billionaire throwing down big bucks for a new hobby. Heck, if he plays this thing right he'll become the most loved man in Sports America. Jordan was the giant who made hundreds of future NBA players seem small by comparison; Sterling, by contrast, is the mental midget who will make any subsequent Clippers owner look like a saint. But Ballmer, the man worth an estimated 20 billion, is especially primed to succeed Sterling, the most-hated man in America, and be welcomed like a frosty glass of lemonade on the stickiest summer day. Sure, Ballmer was never known during his 14-year run at Microsoft as the world's most innovative CEO; one need only track Microsoft's stock price and second-fiddle tech status for proof of that. But, Sterling's cartoon villain status aside, Ballmer does have two significant things going for him that could instantly skyrocket him to the sports world's upper echelon of idolatry. First, for all of Ballmer's shortcomings as an innovator and strategist, two things he never lacked as Microsoft's CEO were personality and enthusiasm. I mean, just look at the guy. The passion! The sweat-stained dress-shirt! Heck, Ballmer looks like he could pull triple-duty as owner, halftime show and hustling reserve off the bench (further proof). Talk about efficiency. But in all seriousness — sports are ultimately a spectacle and fans eat up the antics of over-enthusiastic, well-intentioned franchise owners. Ballmer stands to join Mark Cuban right at the top of the NBA list. Second, starring Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and one of the league's deepest rosters, the Clippers are already a title contender. Ballmer stands a real chance of shepherding the Clippers to their first NBA title within a year or two of taking over the team. As much as sports fans love personality, they love championships more. The paperwork still has to be finalized but all indications are that Ballmer will in the near future be officially introduced as owner of the Los Angles Clippers. Is he over-paying for the team? Maybe — the reported 2 billion price tag will set an NBA record by a factor of four after the Milwaukee Bucks were sold for a then-record 550 million just last month. Any way you slice it, 2 billion is a massive sum. But love, adoration and sports-hero status? You can't put a price on that — especially when you're Steve Ballmer. With 18 billion left over.","output":"Title: \\"Steve Ballmer: The Knight in Shining Armor Set to Rescue the Clippers and Charm NBA Fans\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Eyeglasses are a good option for correcting astigmatism. They help to correct the irregular curve of your cornea and allow your retina to focus properly. Your optometrist will determine your glasses prescription so you can buy glasses to correct the astigmatism. Go to an eyeglasses store and try on glasses in person. Make sure the glasses feel comfortable when they sit on your nose and that they complement, rather than overwhelm, your face. You should feel confident when you wear them. If you want to buy eyeglasses online, you will need your prescription. Use a virtual try-on tool to see how the glasses will look on your face before you order them. Some eyeglass companies will offer to send you free samples of their frames so you can find the right one for you. Spray an eyeglass cleaner on the lenses and wipe them down with a smooth, dry cloth. Clean your glasses once a day, or several times a day, so your vision is not obscured by dust or dirt when you wear them.  Keep your glasses in good condition by getting the screws in the arms tightened when needed. Your glasses should always sit flush against the sides of your face, with the arms on the glasses straight and even. Store your eyeglasses in a hard shell case to protect them and keep them in good repair. To correct astigmatism, you will need special toric contact lenses, rather than standard contact lenses. They are a good option if you don’t like wearing glasses all the time and you are comfortable putting contact lenses in your eye. Your optometrist may recommend contact lenses if you play a lot of sports or are very active and do not want to have to worry about wearing eyeglasses. Children 12 years and older can wear contact lenses. However, they may need the help of a parent to put them in. Wash your hands and then remove the contact from the case. Place it on your index finger. Pull your upper and lower eyelids away from your eye with the other hand. Carefully place the contact on your eye. Release your eyelid and blink to keep the contact in place. If you have trouble putting in the contact lenses, speak to your optometrist for guidance. It may take some practice to get the hang of it. Use a hard shell case to store the contact lenses and keep them in specialized cleaning solution. Look for cleaning solution made specifically for contact lenses at a medical supply store or online.   Replace the cleaning solution every time you use the lenses so they stay clean. Get a new hard shell case every 3 months to ensure the lenses do not get dirty.","output":"This article explains how to choose and take care of eyeglasses or special toric contact lenses for correcting astigmatism, and provides tips on maintaining their good condition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

D) in the past wives and husbands lived separately.","output":"B) In the past there was a clear division of role in the family. Analyzing the given passage, it depicts the reminiscence of old times when the roles of men and women in marital life were starkly divided. A line from the passage, \\"In the old days,\\" as one wife said. \\"The husband was the husband and the wife was the wife.\\" indicates how gender roles were defined and distinct in past times. Men were typically seen as the breadwinners, making them primarily responsible for providing for the family, while women were envisaged as homemakers, making them responsible for house chores, child-rearing, cooking, cleaning, etc.  However, the passage also sheds light on the transformative journey of these roles. It shows how the marital dynamics have evolved over time and how men are willingly sharing household work and responsibilities, hence bridging the gap created by the traditional division of labor. For instance, some men assist their wives in preparing meals, cleaning the house, taking care of the children, doing dishes, etc. Furthermore, the statement \\"The wives wouldn't stand for it nowadays. Husbands help with the children now. They stay more, as well as have more interest, at home.\\" also reflects how society's perception of gender roles has greatly changed. Wives demand and expect their husbands to contribute more to family chores, and the latter conform to these expectations.  So, the wife’s words in the beginning of the passage could best mean that there used to be a clear partition of roles in the family, segregating responsibilities of men and women which is less stringent today, hence option B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is an email Dear Tom,   Enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to  discuss listing other index points at the Socal border. I think the market  requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with  respect to transportation constraints. The market has clearly seen a  divergence in the summer spreads between PG&E and Socal interconnects. The  marginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summer has  proven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting  daily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas  during these months. Because of this, supply being transported from the  Southwest supply basins can only find a home going into PG&E. This places  downward pressure on PG&E Topock gas and upward pressure on Socal Topock  gas. Remember, Socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to  the border via EPNG and TW, but because of the limited capacity of Socal's  interconnects. Demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity. There is also a divergence between Ehrenberg and Topock because of  liquidity. Topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport  contracts on EPNG and downstream buying patterns of certain Socal markets. The market is more diversified at Topock than Ehrenberg. The overwhelming  demand pressure on Socal gets exposed at Topock. Although Ehrenberg is the  marginal point for gas into Socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream  capacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at  Socal Topock than at Ehrenberg. The Socal Ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf  of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter. Ehrenberg  simply gets placed at \\"market prices\\" because of varying objectives. One  transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller  buyers on Socal may not approach this transporter for supplies. This  illiquidity has led to a spread existing between Topock and Ehrenberg. Picture  the market, San Juan gas is trading well below the Permian and Waha  basins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west. Because  of the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on  EPNG and TW wants to fill their contracts with San Juan gas first. These  molecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnect. Likewise,  all Buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery  interconnect (Topock). The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on  the SJ east leg of EPNG. This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas  going into Plains North and allows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on  the EPNG south mainline. While the Socal market peaks in the summer, so does  the EOC demand. Permian west (Keystone West meter)  cannot satisfy both the  EOC demand and the Socal demand. So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG  Waha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south  mainline. This tells the entire story. When demand exceeds all available  historical supply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meet Ehrenberg  demand, you have a paradigm shift. This eliminates any correlation that may  have existed between the supply basins and the market area. When Keystone  West reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the  max rate transport rate then dies a fast death. There is simply no available  capacity at the Keystone West meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate  transport on EPNG and ship it to Socal. If you asked the market what the  maximum interconnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not  know. This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are  above historical levels. It is like Al Gore blaming \\"big oil companies\\" for  the high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity. There  simply isn't the capacity to meet demand. The supply exists, but there isn't  enough refining capacity available to meet demand. Fundamentals rule the  market in all cases. I would like to propose the following index points for the Southern  California border. The market would  be better served with supply being  included in these index points. One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG  Ehrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Three, KRS/Wheeler Ridge. The market  will be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in  the future. We will then address the different interconnects and propose an  index for the Socal citygate as well. Call me on Monday to discuss the Enron Online download.

News article: Maria Sharapova’s romance with Grigor Dimitrov plays out at Wimbledon WIMBLEDON — The hunk with the alleged black heart, Grigor Dimitrov, was playing out on Court 3 Thursday, and Maria Sharapova was sitting in the front row behind a baseline, in the rain, attentively observing her fella. She leaned forward and screamed, “C’mon!” on the big points, as if they were her very own. This was no small commitment. Under normal circumstances, Sharapova would be long gone from the All-England Club, headed back to the States, after she was eliminated a day earlier in a second-round upset. But Sharapova is in this romance to win it, focused on the man at hand, taking love one day at a time and not looking too far ahead in the matchmaking brackets. For what it’s worth, at least from a tennis point of view, Dimitrov has potential. The 29th seed is a comer. His first serve is fearsome, topping out Thursday at 138 mph. His sweeping, one-handed backhand is erratic, but refreshing. Unfortunately, he demonstrated little of his girlfriend’s mental toughness in his suspended, five-set, second-round match with Grega Zemlja of Slovenia. PHOTOS: COURT OF APPEALS: THE HOTTEST TENNIS PLAYERS ON THE PLANET Dimitrov frittered away six break points in the fifth game of the fourth set, when he might have made this a much shorter day. He saved two match points. Then as play dragged on in the drizzle, Dimitrov quickly packed his bags and left the court serving at 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-3, 4-6, 8-9 when the two men were given the option to continue. He slipped often behind the baseline, an ode of sorts to Sharapova. (EDITOR'S NOTE: Dimitrov lost 11-9 in the fifth set as the match was completed Friday) Sharapova walked out of the show court and declined comment, except to Dimitrov, who hopefully received a good lecture on body language and internal strength. If Dimitrov loses this one, Sharapova should break up with him on the grounds of irreconcilable wimpiness. History tells us that tennis love matches are tenuous at best, most likely to endure only when one member of the pair is retired (Roger and Mirka Federer) or if both members are of similar ranking. While Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf are a good fit, Martina Hingis was far too good (according to the computer) for her reported dating partners Radek Stepanek, Magnus Norman, Julian Alonso and Ivo Heuberger. This would suggest that Dimitrov needs to hurry his climb on the tour if this romance is to succeed. RELATED: BONDY: SLIPPERY FALL FOR SHARAPOVA Dimitrov is just 22 years old, which casts both Sharapova, 26, and Serena Williams, 31, as cougars during their recent catfight. While all three in this triangle have tried desperately to change topics once the tournament started, Sharapova and Dimitrov have strolled hand-in-hand this week in Wimbledon Village, doing nothing to discourage voyeurs and photographers. That doesn’t mean Dimitrov wants to talk about any of this. “I definitely won’t comment is the first thing,” he said, after his first-round match. “Second thing is I’m here and I just want to talk about my tennis.” As long as Dimitrov hangs in this tournament, however, the nasty remarks will not disappear. Williams reportedly dated Dimitrov briefly last year. Soon after they parted, and before she began seeing her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, Williams was ready to quit on men. RELATED: BONDY: NO FRIENDS, NO PROBLEM FOR SHARAPOVA “I’ve given up on dating,” she said in May of 2012. “The last relationship was just too much of a heartbreak for me. I have to remove myself from that atmosphere for about the next decade or so.” This month, Williams was quoted in a Rolling Stone magazine article, presumably about Sharapova and Dimitrov, saying, “If she wants to be with the guy with a black heart, go for it.” Sharapova fired back at Williams in her pre-Wimbledon interview with an equally transparent jab at Williams and Mouratoglou, “Maybe she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend that was married and is getting a divorce and has kids.” Even without these famous, feuding girlfriends, Dimitrov is a good tennis story. He is the first Bulgarian man to crack the top 30, to reach the third round of a Grand Slam event and to earn 1 million in prize money. Then there’s the twist: Dmitrov’s parents, both athletes, sent him as a motivated teenager to train at Mouratoglou’s Tennis Academy. It’s not a good idea to ask Mouratoglou about Dimitrov’s progress, at the moment. While Sharapova watched Dimitrov’s stalemate on Court 3, Mouratoglou saw Williams dismantle Caroline Garcia, 6-3, 6-2, on the more prestigious Court 1. In Mouratoglou’s case, as coach, it is his job to watch and critique Williams. Sharapova is a volunteer. If Dimitrov doesn’t get his backhand going, she’s free to leave.

They are observing the speed of the particles in the gases to see how fast they are moving. Gas A has particles moving very quickly, but Gas B has particles that are hardly moving at all.  But I can use this background: We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed.  What is an answer for this question: Which gas is at a lower temperature?","output":"Based on the given information and the principles of the kinetic-molecular theory, Gas B is at a lower temperature. The kinetic-molecular theory suggests that the speed of gas particles is directly related to the temperature. When the temperature is higher, the gas particles move faster due to the increased kinetic energy. Conversely, when the temperature is lower, the particles move slower due to reduced kinetic energy. In the situation you described, Gas A has particles moving very quickly, which indicates a higher temperature. On the other hand, Gas B has particles that are hardly moving at all, demonstrating a lower temperature. It is important to note that the average speed of the particles, rather than the speed of individual particles, is being considered. Some particles in Gas B may be moving quickly, but on average, the particles in Gas B are moving slower than those in Gas A. In summary, the slower movement of particles in Gas B compared to Gas A is indicative of a lower temperature. This conclusion is supported by the foundational principles of the kinetic-molecular theory, which posits a direct relationship between the average speed of gas particles and temperature. The higher the temperature, the faster the gas molecules move; the lower the temperature, the slower they move. Therefore, Gas B is at a lower temperature than Gas A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Here is an article: In a year of voter anger, anti-incumbency, distrust of government and disgust with corporate America, no political race better encapsulates all the conflicting currents buffeting candidates and citizens than the campaign for governor of California. The contrast between the two nominees -- Democrat Edmund G. \\"Jerry\\" Brown Jr. and Republican Meg Whitman -- could hardly be sharper. He is the lifelong politician steeped in the ways of government. She is an outsider promising to put government on a diet and bring a fresh perspective to the capital's dysfunctional culture. That is the metaphor for political year 2010 and one that, with the economy still in a fragile recovery, serves to underscore why Democrats are very much on the defensive in races for the House, Senate and governor across the country. Scratch below the surface, however, and the choices for voters become more complex. \\"In theory it's the worst of both worlds,\\" Bill Whalen, a political analyst at Stanford's Hoover Institution, said of the choice for California voters. \\"A career politician versus a CEO. Neither entity is held in very high esteem these days.\\" Tuesday's elections were a reminder that, while this is a tough year for Democrats and incumbents, there can be surprises ahead. Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln's victory in the Democratic runoff proved that, given the right conditions and the right opponent, a scrappy incumbent can change the equation and survive. Whether she can survive in November remains an open question. The Nevada Republican Senate race, in which tea party favorite Sharron Angle defeated the establishment's candidate, was a reminder that antiestablishment politics may not always produce the strongest candidate for a general election. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D) still is in trouble in his bid for reelection, but he is happier with the very conservative Angle as his opponent than he would have been with the alternatives. That's why California becomes so intriguing. On the surface, it's advantage Whitman. But of course, this is California, a state that has tilted toward the Democrats for more than a decade, a state where President Obama is significantly more popular than he is nationally. California strategists on both sides anticipate a close race until November. There are multiple contrasts between Brown and Whitman, outsider versus insider being just the most obvious. There is new versus old; experience versus inexperience; corporate versus government; big spending conservative (she spent more than 70 million of her own money in the primary) versus parsimonious liberal (he eschewed the governor's mansion when he was in office for a spare apartment). And, of course, there is male versus female. In fact, both Brown and Whitman carry baggage that could weigh them down as they seek to lead the nation's most populous -- and in many ways most troubled -- state. Brown is the mercurial permanent politician, twice a governor at an early age, a failed presidential candidate on several occasions, a former mayor of Oakland with a credible tenure and the current attorney general. Though he has been in and out of office throughout his adult life, Brown has often positioned himself as the opponent of the political establishment. In his own words he has \\"an outsider's mind with an insider's perspective.\\" Whitman is the successful former CEO of eBay who also happens to have ties to Goldman Sachs, the investment banking firm that was charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Until she got interested in politics, she rarely even bothered to vote. She also represents a political party that continues to suffer from image problems with a majority of the American people.

(Associated Press)      FILE - This March 26, 1947, file photo shows Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover calling the communist party of the United States a \\"Fifth Column\\" whose \\"goal is the overthrow of... (Associated Press)      Invasion of Alaska? Yes. It seemed like a real possibility in 1950.      \\"The military believes that it would be an airborne invasion involving bombing and the dropping of paratroopers,\\" one FBI memo said. The most likely targets were thought to be Nome, Fairbanks, Anchorage and Seward.      So FBI director J. Edgar Hoover teamed up on a highly classified project, code-named \\"Washtub,\\" with the newly created Air Force Office of Special Investigations, headed by Hoover protege and former FBI official Joseph F. Carroll.      The secret plan was to have citizen-agents in key locations in Alaska ready to hide from the invaders of what was then only a U.S. territory. The citizen-agents would find their way to survival caches of food, cold-weather gear, message-coding material and radios. In hiding they would transmit word of enemy movements.      This was not civil defense of the sort that became common later in the Cold War as Americans built their own bomb shelters. This was an extraordinary enlistment of civilians as intelligence operatives on U.S. soil.      This account of the \\"Washtub\\" project is based on hundreds of pages of formerly secret documents. The heavily censored records were provided to The Associated Press by the Government Attic, a website that publishes government documents it obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.      The Russians never invaded, of course.      So the covert cadre of \\"stay-behind agents,\\" as they were known, was never activated to collect and report wartime information from backwoods bunkers. It was an assignment that federal officials acknowledged (to each other, if not to the new agents) was highly dangerous, given that the Soviet Union's military doctrine called for the elimination of local resistance in occupied territory.      To compensate for expected casualties, a reserve pool of agents was to be held outside of Alaska and inserted by air later as short-term replacements. This assignment was seen as an easier sell to potential recruits because \\"some agents might not be too enthusiastic about being left behind in enemy-occupied areas for an indefinite period of time,\\" one planning document noted dryly.      \\"Washtub\\" was not, however, a washout.      It operated from 1951-59, according to Deborah Kidwell, official historian of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, or OSI.      \\"While war with the Soviet Union did not come to Alaska, OSI trained 89 SBA (stay-behind agents), and the survival caches served peacetime purposes for many years to come,\\" she wrote in an OSI magazine last year.      With the benefit of hindsight, it would be easy to dismiss \\"Washtub\\" as a harebrained scheme born of paranoia. In fact it reflected genuine worry about Soviet intentions and a sense of U.S. vulnerability in a turbulent post-World War II period.      As the plan was being shaped in 1950, Soviet-backed North Korea invaded South Korea, triggering a war on the peninsula that some in the Pentagon saw as a deliberate move by Moscow to distract Washington before invading Europe. The previous summer the Soviets stunned the world by exploding their first atomic bomb. Also in 1949, the U.S. locked arms with Western Europe to form the NATO alliance, and Mao Zedong's revolutionaries declared victory in China, adding to American fear that communism was on the march.      \\"Washtub\\" was known inside the government by several other codenames, including Corpuscle, Stigmatic and Catboat, according to an official Air Force history of the OSI, which called it one of OSI's \\"most extensive and long-running Cold War projects.\\" The FBI had its own code word for the project: STAGE.      \\"Washtub\\" had two phases.      The first and more urgent was the stay-behind agent program. The second was a parallel effort to create a standby pool of civilian operatives in Alaska trained to clandestinely arrange for the evacuation of downed military air crews in danger of being captured by Soviet forces. This \\"evasion and escape\\" plan was coordinated with the CIA.      Among those listed as a stay-behind agent was Dyton Abb Gilliland of Cooper Landing, a community on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage. A well-known bush pilot, Gilliland died in a plane crash on Montague Island in Prince William Sound in May 1955 at age 45. FBI records say he spent 12 days in Washington D.C., in June-July 1951 undergoing a range of specialized training, including in the use of parachutes.      The agents also got extensive training in coding and decoding messages, but this apparently did not always go well. Learning these techniques was \\"an almost impossible task for backwoodsmen to master in 15 hours of training,\\" one document said. Details in the document were blacked out.      Many agent names in the OSI and FBI documents also were removed before being declassified.      None of the indigenous population was included. The program founders believed that agents from the \\"Eskimo, Indian and Aleut groups in the Territory should be avoided in view of their propensities to drink to excess and their fundamental indifference to constituted governments and political philosophies. It is pointed out that their prime concern is with survival and their allegiance would easily shift to any power in control.\\"      Recruiters pitched patriotism and were to offer retainer fees of up to 3,000 a year (nearly 30,000 in 2014 dollars). That sum was to be doubled \\"after an invasion has commenced,\\" according to one planning document. The records do not say how much was actually paid during the course of the program.      At least some recruits were fingerprinted and all were secretly screened by the FBI for signs of disloyalty.      The FBI linked one candidate, a resident of Stony River, to a list of names in a 1943 bureau file on \\"Communist Party activities, Alaska\\" that tracked U.S. subscribers to a magazine called \\"Soviet Russia Today.\\"      Another candidate was flagged — falsely, it turned out — as a likely communist sympathizer based on an FBI informant's tip about membership in the \\"Tom Paine Club, Communist Party, Spokane, Washington.\\"      One was described in a May 1952 OSI memo to the FBI office in Anchorage as the postmaster in Kiana, Alaska; another was manager of a hotel in Valdez. One agent candidate worked for a tin-mining company at Lost River on the Seward Peninsula, one of the higher-priority areas for placing \\"Washtub\\" stay-behind agents.      The FBI tapped its local contacts, including federal judges, the head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage, an Anchorage physician and others for names of reliable Alaskans to be approached.      \\"Washtub' was crafted in painstaking detail. But just as the first trained agents were to be put in place in September 1951, Hoover pulled out, leaving it in OSI's hands, even though one month earlier his top lieutenants had advised him the FBI was \\"in these programs neck deep,\\" with an \\"obvious and inescapable\\" duty to proceed.      Hoover worried that when the shooting in Alaska started the FBI would be \\"left holding the bag.\\"      \\"If a crisis arose we would be in the midst of another 'Pearl Harbor' and get part of the blame,\\" Hoover wrote in the margin of a Sept. 6, 1951, memo from an aide, to whom Hoover added one final order: \\"Get out at once.\\"      Three years later, Hoover was pulled back in, briefly.      In October 1954, an envelope and a typewritten letter containing a coded message were turned over to the FBI by a woman in Anchorage. It had been misaddressed by the anonymous sender in Fairbanks. Espionage was suspected, triggering flurries of FBI internal memos. Hoover was informed that bureau code breakers were urgently trying to decipher the message.      They never broke the code but eventually declared the crisis over. The mystery message, they determined, was not from an enemy spy. It was a \\"practice message\\" sent errantly by one of the \\"Washtub\\" agents.      ___      Follow Robert Burns on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/robertburnsAP ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In the early Cold War years, the U.S. government recruited and trained fishermen, bush pilots, trappers and other private citizens across Alaska for a covert network, code-named \\"Washtub\\", to provide wartime intelligence in the event of a Russian invasion.

The mention of the file-swapping software firm Kazaa and its ongoing legal case in Australia place the subject matter in the realm of technology and its relationship with the law. Kazaa is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing platform that allows users to exchange music files, among other digital content, over the internet. The P2P technology, while innovative and transformative in the way data is shared, raised concerns and ignited debates over copyright infringement and digital piracy.  In the early 2000s, file-sharing platforms like Kazaa, Napster, and LimeWire were at the center of a heated controversy. Music industry representatives argued that these platforms facilitated the illegal distribution of copyrighted material, resulting in substantial revenue losses for artists, producers, and record labels. On the other hand, proponents of file-sharing maintained that this new technology provided users with the freedom to access and share content, challenging the traditional profit-driven model of the music and entertainment industries. In this particular case, Kazaa faced a legal battle in Australia, with the firm's lawyers arguing in its defense. The case highlights the challenges of adapting existing copyright laws to the evolving digital landscape and addressing the complex ethical considerations that come with new technologies. While these platforms may have contributed to a culture of digital piracy, they also paved the way for innovative content distribution models like streaming services, which have since become the new normal. Furthermore, the Kazaa case presents an insightful examination of the role of technology companies in shaping and mitigating the effects of their products on society and various industries. The legal battles and controversies surrounding file-sharing platforms prompted technology companies to engage more proactively with intellectual property rights holders, leading to the development of more sustainable business models like Spotify, Apple Music, and Netflix, which provide legal access to vast libraries of media content for a fee. In addition to its impact on the music industry, the Kazaa case highlights the broader implications of technology advancements for law, regulation, and public policy. As innovations continue to disrupt traditional industries and challenge existing legal frameworks, governments and regulatory bodies are faced with the formidable task of striking a delicate balance between fostering innovation and safeguarding the rights and interests of various stakeholders. In summary, the topic of Kazaa's legal battle in Australia over music piracy relates to Science/Tech. The case serves as an important example of the challenges brought about by the rapid advancements in technology, particularly regarding intellectual property rights, and the need to adapt and evolve legal frameworks to accommodate these changes while protecting the interests of creators and other stakeholders in the digital era."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Problem:CLAIM : The following post is HYPOTHETICAL. POST : Backstory to this, my girlfriend of two years broke up with me, and in the beginning the only explanation she gave me was that we just drifted apart, and that alone would be completely fine. I didn't accept that answer, and after asking around it turned out that she in fact liked someone else at the same time, and had started dating him less than a month after we broke up. After confronting her about why she lied when breaking up with me, she told me it had only been a \\"facter,\\" and she only started liking him after we broke up, and the main really was that she just stopped loving me. I accepted that answer and moved on. So a couple months go by, and today while talking to a friend about her he tells me that the entire reason she broke up with me was because of the other guy, and she lied to me about pretty much everything else about why she broke up with me. Would I be the asshole to reveal to her friend how much she didn't like him and shit talked him?

Police in Cleveland, said Sunday that a 3-year-old boy picked up an unattended gun inside... (Associated Press)      Chief Calvin Williams said investigators are trying to determine where the gun in Sunday afternoon's shooting came from and how it was left within reach of a child.      Full details about the shooting on the city's east side weren't released, but Williams said at least one adult was home when it happened.      \\"A 3-year-old cannot be held accountable for a tragedy like this,\\" said Williams. He said someone had to have supplied the weapon or \\"knew the weapons were there and didn't do anything to safeguard them, so people will be held accountable for this tragedy.\\"      Police say the older child picked up an unattended gun and shot the 1-year-old.

The person responsible for bringing the gun into a house with young children and leaving it within reach of a small boy may face charges, he told a group of reporters gathered in front of the East 63rd Street house where the boy was shot Sunday afternoon.      Police are unsure who brought the gun into the house and why it was left within reach of a small boy, but Williams said an American preoccupation with guns is the underlying problem      \\"The fascination with handguns, not just in the city, but in the country, has to stop,\\" he said. \\"We need to take a long look at what we're doing on the state, local and national level to keep these guns out of our communities.\\"      Williams spoke briefly about the incident after a crime scene investigation team swept the scene and interviewed witnesses. He answered only a handful of questions before he left.      A preliminary investigation shows that a 3-year-old boy picked up an unattended firearm and it went off, hitting a 1-year-old boy in the head, he said.      The boy was taken to a nearby hospital and later pronounced dead.      Police are still trying to piece together the events leading up to the shooting, Williams said, but he told reporters at least one adult was home when it happened.      \\"There had to have been adults that either supplied the weapon, (loaded) the weapon, or that knew the weapon was there and didn't do anything to safeguard it,\\" he said.      Neighbors said a mother lives in the house with three small boys, but it is unclear if the shooter is related to the victim.      The victim's mother could be heard screaming from the back porch after officers told her that her son was dead.      Several other children were inside the house when the shooting took place, Williams said.      People who live in the East Side neighborhood said the families there mostly keep to themselves.      Next-door neighbor Larry Simpson said he hung a TV in the living room of the victim's mother.      \\"They were friendly with us,\\" he said, saying he spoke with them occasionally when they were sitting on their front porch.      He called the shooting a senseless tragedy. ||||| CLEVELAND - The family of a 1-year-old boy shot to death by a 3-year-old playmate is speaking out about the tragedy.      The child's aunt said 1-year-old Braylon Robinson was playing on the floor with two other children, ages one and three, who were described as the children of a family friend.      Investigators said they believe the boy was shot by a 3-year-old child boy.      Shonda Robinson, Braylon's aunt, said her sister heard the gun go off, but was on the couch facing the other direction when the 3-year-old apparently found the weapon.      A handgun was found near the 3-year-old. Neither of the other children sustained injuries.      Robinson says the family was unaware that any weapons were in the home and suspect it may have belonged to the child's father.      Describing the emotional loss the family is facing, Robinson said, \\"We can never get that back and his mother can never get that back—that's her only child and he's gone.\\"      Robinson added, \\"Somebody should be held accountable.\\"      \\"It’s a sad day for Cleveland,\\" Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said outside the home, located in the 3700 block of East 63rd Street. \\"A 1-year-old child lost his life.\\"      Williams said the gun was unattended and police are investigating where the gun came from and how the child got ahold of it.      \\"A 3-year-old can't be held accountable for a tragedy like this. There have to be adults that either supplied the weapons, had charge of the weapons or knew the weapons were there and didn't do anything to safeguard them,\\" Williams said.      The victim, identified by the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's office as Braylon Robinson, died while being taken to the hospital.      Williams said the incident calls for the community to look at ways to curb gun-related deaths, not just in Cleveland, but in the country.      \\"This fascination we have with handguns, not just in the city, but in this country has to stop. This is a senseless loss of life in this city again,\\" Williams said. \\"It’s directly related to guns. We need to really take a hard look at the things that we’re doing out there on the state, local, and national level to get some of these guns out of our community.\\"      The two relatives of the deceased child were released to their mother.

Write an article based on this summary: – The Cleveland man accused of shooting an elderly man Sunday and posting video of the murder on Facebook is armed, dangerous, and could be out of Ohio by now, police say. An aggravated murder warrant was issued for Steve Stephens late Sunday and police have asked people in Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, and Michigan to be on the alert, CBS reports. Police, who initially said Stephens broadcast the murder of 74-year-old Robert Godwin on Facebook Live, now say he posted the video after the killing. In the video, Stephens appears to target the elderly passerby at random. In another video, the 37-year-old claims to have killed more than a dozen other people, reports Cleveland 19. Police describe Stephens as a 6-foot-1, 244-pound black male with a full beard and say he is driving a white Ford Fusion sedan that may have the temporary Ohio tag E363630. In his videos, Stephens, who works for an agency that provides youth counselling services, says he snapped because of problems with partner Joy Lane and other family members. At a Sunday evening press conference, Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson and Police Chief Calvin Williams called the killing \\"senseless\\" and urged Stephens to turn himself before he harms anybody else, the Cleveland Dispatch reports. Williams said police hadn't found any evidence to support Stephens' claim to have carried out more killings. Article:","output":"Cleveland Manhunt for Suspect in Facebook Live Video Murder The city of Cleveland, Ohio, is experiencing a state of heightened alert as authorities and local communities work together to detect the whereabouts of Steve Stephens, the primary suspect in the brutal murder of a 74-year-old man. The horrific event has generated feelings of shock and terror beyond the city’s borders, due to the fact that Stephens recorded and posted a video of the crime on Facebook, sharing it on a popular social media platform for the world to see. A warrant was issued for Steve Stephens' arrest late Sunday, shortly after he was accused of shooting Robert Godwin, Sr., as the elderly man walked on a sidewalk. Although Stephens allegedly chose Godwin, seemingly at random, he potentially is linked to more heinous crimes. During one of his video posts, the 37-year-old suspect claimed that he has killed more than a dozen other individuals. Cleveland Police have urged people in neighboring states, including Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, and Michigan, to remain vigilant and on the lookout for the suspect, who is believed to be heavily armed and a significant risk to public safety. Authorities have issued a detailed description of Stephens, who is 6-foot-1, 244 pounds, with a full beard. The suspect, who reportedly claimed to work for a counseling agency that provides support to troubled youths, was seen driving a white Ford Fusion sedan with a temporary Ohio plate, now thought to be on the run. In an effort to understand the motives behind these disturbing events, investigators have looked closely at the content of Stephens' various video posts. In the recordings, he speaks at length about his motives, citing the problems he experienced in his relationship with his partner, Joy Lane, among other familial issues. This has led many to speculate that personal turmoil may have driven him to commit this horrifying act. However, Cleveland police have not disclosed whether they believe these factors played a role in Godwin's senseless killing. Community leaders, including Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson and Police Chief Calvin Williams, have appealed to residents to remain resilient within the face of these terrifying events. They have also called upon Stephens to peacefully turn himself in before inflicting any further harm. As Williams stated during a press conference, \\"There is no need for any further bloodshed in this incident tonight.\\" Both Facebook and the social media community are also grappling with the implications of these disturbing crimes. Although Facebook has removed Stephens' video of the attack, it remains a chilling reminder of the darker potentialities of social media – transforming it from a harmless pastime to a platform for delivering messages of terror. As of now, police have not yet found any evidence to support Stephens' claims of other killings, but this investigation remains open, and authorities continue to work tirelessly to apprehend the suspect and provide answers and a sense of closure to the families affected by this tragedy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They were boyfriend and girlfriend and lived in a faraway land called Portugal. One day, they heard about a little girl named Maddie McCann who was lost. People were very sad and worried about Maddie, so they offered a big prize of £2.5 million (that's lots and lots of money!) to anyone who could give information to help find her. Danilo and Aurora wanted this money very, very much. So, they tried to tell a story that they knew something about Maddie, even though they really didn't know anything. This was not a nice thing to do because it made people believe that they could help find Maddie when they couldn't. When the people who offered the money found out that Danilo and Aurora weren't telling the truth, they got very upset. They called the police, who came and arrested Danilo and Aurora. This means that the police took them to a place where they couldn't leave, because they were in big trouble for doing something wrong. The funny thing is, this wasn't the first time that Danilo and Aurora got in trouble for trying to get the money about Maddie. They did the same thing in 2007, but they were let go that time. Now, Danilo and Aurora are waiting to see what will happen to them for trying to trick people and get money that they didn't deserve.

Second question: If athletes keep getting better why has no one matched Bruce Lee? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"Firstly, no these two questions aren't the same thing. They are different but related, as they both talk about Bruce Lee, who was an amazing martial artist. Now, let's answer each question one by one: 1. If you want to become lean and muscular like Bruce Lee, it's like building a sandcastle. You can't do it all at once, but gradually, bit by bit. You'll have to do exercises like Bruce Lee did, like jumping, running, push-ups and many others. You'll also have to eat healthy, just like how we choose the best pieces to build our sandcastle. This means eating lots of fruits, vegetables, and proteins, and less junk food. But remember, it's not just about looking like Bruce Lee, but also being strong and healthy from the inside, like a tough, sturdy sandcastle. 2. About athletes getting better but not matching Bruce Lee - it's like asking why, if artists keep getting better, why has no one painted another 'Mona Lisa'. Each person is unique, like a one-of-a-kind snowflake or a rare gemstone. Bruce Lee was special because he combined his physical strength, speed, and martial art skills in a way that few other people have been able to. He also had a powerful mind and believed in constant learning. Just like each artist has a unique style or each snowflake has a different pattern, each athlete has their own special strengths.

Choose from options. \\"Which of the following statements is true\\" Select from: (i). biofuel releases CO2 but is better than oil (ii). biofuel is without flaws (iii). biofuel can single-handedly end CO2 production (iv). biofuel is perfect for the environment","output":"(i). biofuel releases CO2 but is better than oil Biofuel does release CO2 when it is burned for energy, just like any other fuel. However, it is considered better than oil in terms of emissions because the plants that are used to produce biofuels also absorb CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow, partially offsetting the emissions. This creates a closed carbon cycle, unlike fossil fuels, which release additional CO2 into the atmosphere that was previously trapped underground. Nevertheless, it should be noted that biofuels are not a perfect solution to reducing emissions as they may lead to other environmental issues such as deforestation and increased water use. Other options are incorrect because: (ii). biofuel is without flaws: As mentioned earlier, biofuels do have some environmental drawbacks, aside from CO2 emissions, such as deforestation and water consumption. (iii). biofuel can single-handedly end CO2 production: Biofuels can help reduce CO2 emissions, but they cannot completely eliminate them. A combination of various renewable energy sources would be required to significantly reduce carbon emissions worldwide. (iv). biofuel is perfect for the environment: Although biofuels have some advantages, they are not ideal for the environment due to their associated environmental impacts such as deforestation and water consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Yes, the answer to both questions would be the same as they are asking about alternative options for shortening in a pie crust. Here is a detailed response to the shared inquiry: There are several alternatives that you can use to substitute shortening in a pie crust. Choosing the right substitute depends on your taste preferences, dietary restrictions, and the specific requirements of the recipe. Some popular shortening substitutes include: 1. Butter: Butter is a common and versatile alternative to shortening. It adds a rich, flaky texture to the pie crust, and lends a subtle, pleasing flavor. When using butter, make sure it is cold, and cut it into small pieces when incorporating it into the flour mixture. It has a slightly lower melting point than shortening, so you may need to take extra care when handling the dough to ensure it stays cold. For every 1 cup of shortening, you can use 1 cup of butter. 2. Lard: Lard is a traditional fat used in pie crusts and offers a similar consistency to shortening. It is derived from pork fat and has a neutral flavor, making it an appropriate choice for both sweet and savory pies. It also provides the flakiness characteristic of pie crusts. Lard can be found in the refrigerated section of your grocery store or at a local butcher. To substitute lard for shortening, use the same amount of lard as you would shortening. 3. Coconut oil: Coconut oil is an excellent shortening substitute for vegans or those avoiding dairy. It has a high melting point, similar to shortening, which gives a flaky texture to the pie crust. When using coconut oil, opt for the refined variety, which has a neutral flavor that won’t overpower your pie. Use it in a solid-state, as it is relatively heat sensitive and may become too soft if melted. Substitute an equal amount of coconut oil for shortening. 4. Vegetable oil: Vegetable oil can be used as an alternative to shortening in pie crusts, but it can affect the texture. It may make the crust less flaky, but it still works well for a more tender crust. To use vegetable oil, substitute 1 cup of shortening with about ¾ cup of vegetable oil.  5. Margarine: Margarine is another option for those looking to avoid dairy products. It is made from vegetable oils and has a similar consistency to shortening. Opt for a high-quality, non-hydrogenated, and cold margarine for the best results. To substitute shortening with margarine, use the same amount as you would for shortening. In conclusion, the answer to both questions is the same, with multiple options available to substitute shortening in a pie crust. The choice depends on your specific requirements and taste preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Other entities already present will assist in such ways as stability of orbit and extra energy beaming into the atmosphere for leveling upwards the cellular memories Add punctuation","output":"Other entities already present will assist in various ways, such as contributing to the stability of orbit and providing extra energy by beaming it into the atmosphere. This process will help in leveling upwards the cellular memories, which can improve overall functionality and efficiency. The process begins with these entities ensuring that the orbit remains stable to maintain the optimum conditions required for beaming the energy. Various factors, such as gravitational forces, solar winds, and space debris, can potentially affect the stability of orbit. As such, the entities must take appropriate precautions and measures to negate these potential threats. Once the stability of orbit is secured, the entities proceed with beaming extra energy into the atmosphere. This energy could be derived from various sources, including clean and sustainable options like solar, wind, and nuclear fusion. By harnessing this energy and carefully channeling it into the atmosphere, the objective of leveling upward cellular memories can be achieved. Cellular memories refer to the information and experiences that cells store, which allow them to function efficiently, adapt to new environments, and even replicate in some cases. These memories play a critical role in supporting life processes and contribute to the overall health of an organism. By leveling up these cellular memories, improvements in the organism's biological processes may be seen, leading to enhanced growth, reproduction, and wellbeing. The extra energy supplied by the entities can lead to an enhancement in the molecular and cellular functions, as well as an acceleration of healing and regeneration processes. Moreover, this additional energy may spark dormant or underutilized cellular capabilities, leading to an overall improvement in the organism's functioning. In summary, the assistance provided by other entities in terms of maintaining a stable orbit and beaming extra energy into the atmosphere can elevate cellular memories powering various life processes. This can lead to substantial improvements in overall health and wellbeing, and may unlock previously untapped potential within the organism itself."},{"instruction":"Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who has released his most personal album to date? , can you please find it?   Youssou N'Dour: I Bring What I Love is a music-driven film that explores one man's power to inspire global change. The film unfolds at a pivotal moment in the life of Youssou N'Dour—the best-selling African pop artist of all time. N'Dour has long been renowned for bringing people of diverse nations and backgrounds together through his collaborations with such musical superstars as Bono, Paul Simon, and Peter Gabriel. But when he releases his most personal and spiritual album yet, he instead alienates his Muslim fans in Africa. Although he garners accolades in the West, N'Dour must brave controversy and rejection at home as he sets out to win his audience back. Director Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi tracks N'Dour's journey over two years – filming his life in Africa, Europe, and America. He initially releases his album Egypt in the hopes of promoting a more tolerant face of Islam. Yet, when his fellow Senegalese reject the album, and denounce it as blasphemous, he takes this as a challenge to go deeper, to reach out to those who would attack him, and to work even harder to use his songs to unite a divided world.

Summarize this article: There’s good news for the Casanovas of the world – sleeping with numerous women could help to protect men from prostate cancer, according to a new study.      Researchers at the University of Montreal and INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier found that men who had slept with more than 20 women during their lifetime were 28 per cent less likely to develop the disease.      They were also 19 per cent less likely to develop an aggressive type of cancer, compared to those who had had only one female sexual partner.      However, the same did not apply to gay men, according to the Canadian scientists. They found that having more than 20 male partners doubled the risk of prostate cancer and made an aggressive cancer five times more likely. Sleeping with one male partner did not affect the risk.      Video: Prostate cancer on the rise in UK            Meanwhile, men who were virgins were almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer as those who were sexually experienced.      The findings are from the Prostate Cancer & Environment Study in which 3,208 men answered questions about their lifestyle and sex lives.      Of these men, 1,590 were diagnosed with prostate cancer between September 2005 and August 2009, while 1,618 men were part of the control group.      Overall, men with prostate cancer were twice as likely as others to have a relative with cancer, but the study also found a possible link with their number of sexual partners.      Lead researcher Professor Marie-Elise Parent, from the University of Montreal, said: \\"It is possible that having many female sexual partners results in a higher frequency of ejaculations, whose protective effect against prostate cancer has been previously observed in cohort studies.\\"      According to one theory, large numbers of ejaculations may reduce the concentration of cancer-causing substances in prostatic fluid, a constituent of semen.      They may also lead to fewer crystal-like structures in the prostate that have been associated with prostate cancer.      Suggesting why the same did not apply to male partners Professor Parent admitted she could only provide \\"highly speculative\\" explanations.      One explanation she said \\"could be that anal intercourse produces a physical trauma to the prostate\\".      The age at which men first had sexual intercourse, and the number of times they had been infected by a sexually transmitted disease, had no bearing on prostate cancer risk.      A total of 12 per cent of the group reported having had at least one sexually transmitted infection (STI) in their lifetime.      Professor Parent added: \\"We were fortunate to have participants from Montreal who were comfortable talking about their sexuality, no matter what sexual experiences they have had, and this openness would probably not have been the same 20 or 30 years ago.      \\"Indeed, thanks to them, we now know that the number and type of partners must be taken into account to better understand the causes of prostate cancer.\\"      On the question of whether promiscuity might now be recommended in health advice to men, she said: \\"We're not there yet.\\"      The research is published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.  Question: \\"What doe \\"lab-to-fab\\" time mean?\\" Answer: \\"Strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct. \\"Lab-to-fab\\" time refers to the amount of time it takes to move innovations from the research laboratories to the semiconductor fabrication factory.

Summarize: An international team detected the light display around a brown dwarf about 18 light years away in the Lyra constellation. They say the luminous glow looks like the northern lights, but is up to a million times brighter and more red than green in colour. The findings are reported in the journal Nature. Dr Stuart Littlefair, an astronomer from the University of Sheffield, said: \\"This is the first time that we have confirmed we are seeing auroras on brown dwarfs.\\" Charged interaction Shimmering auroras are some of the Earth's most dazzling displays. This luminous glow can also appear around all the planets in our Solar System. They are caused when charged particles from the Sun interact with the atmosphere. But the illuminated brown dwarf, an object which is too small to have become a star but too massive to be a planet, lies further out in the galaxy. Called LSR J1835, it was observed using the Very Large Array radio telescope and the Hale and Keck optical telescopes. The scientists watched the object as it rapidly rotated, and observed how the light varied. \\"The brightness changes are consistent with what you would expect from auroras,\\" said Dr Littlefair. The dwarf's aurora is mainly red in colour because the charged particles are mainly interacting with hydrogen in its atmosphere. On Earth, the greenish glow is caused as the electrons from the Sun hit oxygen atoms. However, scientists are puzzled about how the light show is being generated. The brown dwarf is a sort of failed star itself, and has no other star like the Sun nearby to blast it with charged particles. \\"It is possible material is being stripped off the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons,\\" said Dr Littlefair. Another option is an as-yet-undetected planet or moon around the dwarf is throwing off material to light it up. Some of Jupiter's auroras are produced in this way, as charged particles are emitted from volcanoes on its moon Io. The discovery is also helping scientists to better understand brown dwarfs. There is some debate over whether they are more star-like in their nature, or whether they have planetary attributes. \\"If you are working in brown dwarfs, it matters whether you think of them as small stars or big planets,\\" said Dr Littlefair. \\"We already known from observations of brown dwarfs that they have clouds in the atmosphere. Now we know they also show auroras, it is yet more reason to consider brown dwarfs as scaled-up versions of planets rather than scaled-down version of stars.\\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter.","output":"An international team has detected a luminous glow similar to the Northern Lights, but up to a million times brighter and more red than green, around a brown dwarf approximately 18 light years away in the Lyra constellation.

They share a common past; they grew up amidst the blaring horns and sleepless nights of the city, but their futures look drastically different. Bodo, the older of the two, is a stern and diligent lawyer, upholding justice with grit and determination. Walter, on the other hand, is a free-spirited artist, painting his dreams and ambitions on the canvas of life. Their bond faced a significant strain when Walter accidentally destroyed one of Bodo's crucial cases - oblivious of the consequences, he used it as a prop for his art exhibition. Bodo's disappointment was palpable, and the brothers' once strong ties started unraveling. Life continued for the presently estranged brothers until fate decides to interweave their paths again when they stumble upon a century-old mystery - an unclaimed artifact of great worth found in their late grandparents' attic. Realizing its potential, they set out to unravel the history behind this piece, coerced more by their financial needs than their curiosity. The journey takes them through the labyrinth of their family's forgotten past. They face danger and deceit, threaded with revelations, making them question everything they knew about their family. The brothers, in their quest, slowly understand that the family mystery is not about the artifact but the values, unity, and love that their family held dear. Over time, Bodo starts to appreciate Walter's creative genius, seeing beyond his irresponsibility. Walter, too, realizes the pressure on Bodo, understanding his stern demeanor. They repair their relationship, become a powerful team, and solve the mystery, giving the artifact its deserved place in history. Ultimately, the journey to solve a family mystery becomes a journey of self-realization and reunion for Bodo and Walter. Through trials, tribulations, laughter, and love, they understand that blood ties are not just about being born to the same parents, but respecting their differences and standing together when it matters the most. With this newfound understanding, Bodo and Walter embark on different paths in life, still tied together by the strong bond of brotherhood – a bond sealed not in the bustling city of their childhood but in the silent acknowledgment of their shared history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The helicopter, which they see is from a Norwegian research base, flies in and lands. The Americans watch puzzled as two men that emerge from the helicopter speak frantically in their native language. One of them pulls the pin on a grenade but clumsily throws it behind him. As he frantically tries to find it in the snow, it explodes, killing him and taking the helicopter with it. The pilot (named Matias in the prequel) is shooting his rifle hysterically and talking frantically; no one can understand what he is saying and the man shoots Bennings (Peter Maloney) in his left leg.

During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.  Two neighboring islands Grey island and Sand island both contributed to global warming by their actions. Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless.  Which island burned less fossil fuels? Answer:","output":"Sand Island burned less fossil fuels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose belief is shared that Davenport has become too emotionally close to his command? is inside the article: In 1949, former U.S. Army Air Forces officer Harvey Stovall spots a familiar Toby Jug in the window of a London antique shop and learns that it came from Archbury, an airfield where Stovall served during World War II. Convinced that it is the same jug, he buys it and journeys to the derelict airfield.  Stovall remembers the events of 1942, when the 918th Bomb Group at Archbury had gained a reputation as the 'hard luck group'. After a particularly disastrous mission, group commander Colonel Keith Davenport appears exhausted and demoralized. His defeatist attitude spreads to other senior leaders of the group, including his Air Exec, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately. Ordered to fly another mission the next day, at a dangerously low altitude, Davenport protests to his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations at VIII Bomber Command.

Hugh Glass Born in Pennsylvania to Scots-Irish parents , Glass became an explorer of the watershed of the Upper Missouri River, in present-day Montana, the Dakotas, and the Platte River area of Nebraska. His life story has been adapted into two feature-length films: Man in the Wilderness (1971) and The Revenant (2015). They both portray the survival struggle of Glass, who (in the best historical accounts) crawled and stumbled 200 miles (320 km) to Fort Kiowa, South Dakota after being abandoned without supplies or weapons by fellow explorers and fur traders during General Ashley's expedition of 1823. Is this statement correct \\"what is the revenant based on a true story\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement is correct. The Revenant, a 2015 film directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is based on the true story of Hugh Glass, an American frontiersman, fur trapper, and explorer. The screenplay for the film is primarily inspired by Michael Punke's 2002 novel, \\"The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge,\\" which itself is a fictionalized account of Glass's experiences. Hugh Glass was born in Pennsylvania to Scots-Irish parents and became an explorer of the watershed of the Upper Missouri River, in present-day Montana, the Dakotas, and the Platte River area of Nebraska. He is renowned for his survival story after being brutally attacked by a grizzly bear during General Ashley's expedition of 1823. Glass suffered extensive injuries and was left for dead by his fellow explorers, who also took his supplies and weapons. Remarkably, Glass managed to survive the ordeal by crawling and stumbling 200 miles (320 km) to Fort Kiowa, South Dakota, despite his grievous injuries, lack of supplies, and the constant threat of hostile Native American tribes along the way. This incredible tale of survival, determination, and revenge became the basis for both Man in the Wilderness (1971) and The Revenant (2015). While The Revenant is based on a true story, creative liberties have been taken to dramatize certain events and characters for cinematic purposes. Nonetheless, the film effectively captures the essence of Hugh Glass's harrowing experience and his remarkable perseverance in the face of overwhelming adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The family of Michael Boatwright - who was found unconscious in a Palm Springs motel room four months ago and woke up speaking only Swedish - have revealed themselves after learning of his whereabouts for the first time on Monday. Even though his driver's license says he. was born in Florida and served in the U.S. Navy from 1971 to 1973,. Boatwright has no memory of his life to date and now answers only to. Johan and converses in Swedish to doctors with the help of an. interpreter. Now Boatwright’s sister has revealed that she did not know whether he was alive or dead and that she hasn't seen him for 10 years. Scroll Down for Video. Amnesia: Michael Boatwright awoke to find he had no memory of his past life to date, could not recognize his own reflection and believed he was Swedish. 'I haven’t talked to him in years. He just disappeared,' Michelle Brewer  told The Desert Sun over the phone from her home in Louisiana. She said that she had no way to get in touch with the 61-year-old, even when their mother had died last year, she said. 'He’s always been just a wanderer. Then he’d come back when he needed some money or something from somebody. Then he’d take off again,' she said. Boatwright was overwhelmed by the flood of calls Monday, but wanted to thank those who were helping him piece together his story, hospital spokesman Rich Ramhoff said. Former life; Michael Boatwright served in the U.S. Navy from 1971 to 1973 (left) and was carrying old photographs on him when he was discovered in a Palm Springs motel room in February. His. current persona of Johan Elk, clashes with the Social Security card,. passport and veteran's medical card he was carrying in February and. following mental and physical health exams, Boatwright was diagnosed on. March 13th with transient global amnesia. Doctors. at Desert Regional Medical Center have theorized that his total memory. loss was triggered by some kind of emotional or physical trauma - what. exactly that was though, they admit to drawing a blank on. 'He's. kind of a blank slate,' said Lisa Hunt-Vasquez, the social worker. assigned to track down relatives and help piece his life back together. Searching. on the internet, Hunt-Vasquez has learned so far that Boatwright was a. 3D graphic designer who taught English in Japan for 10 years and then in. China for four. She has discovered on a testimonial on. the website of a TPR English School in Zhuhai, China, that he left his. teaching post one year before his catastrophic memory loss. Baffling: Michael Boatwright is pictured here with two women - one who is believed to be his wife and a little boy thought to be his son. However, every attempt to discover a friend or relative has failed. An address on his U.S. passport for a Japanese woman believed to be his ex-wife was a dead end - as was all the telephone numbers listed on his cellphone. Indeed, the Japanese, Chinese and Swedish consulates have turned up no next-of-kind information. What is known is that Boatwright flew into Palm Springs from Hong Kong on February 24th - which was the last day valid on his Chinese visa. Hunt-Vasquez said that she did not know why he had chosen to fly into California and even contacted local tennis clubs to see if he was scheduled to play - thinking his tennis rackets might be a clue. Upon contacting Dade County Missing Persons Bureau in Florida, she found that Boatwright's parents were deceased and that his first wife divorced him in 1983 - she could not be contacted. It was even thought at one point that Boatwright could have two sisters in Sweden, but again, that has not been confirmed. No Recollection: This is one of the photographs which have failed to jog the memory of Michael Boatwright from his amnesia. For Boatwright, the sheer frustration and confusion of the whole ordeal is maddening. 'When I look at the photos, I see my ex-wife and my son ... my mother and grandmother, but I don't recognize them. I don't know them,' he said. 'Sometimes it makes me really sad and sometimes it just makes me furious about the whole situation.' Indeed, to help Boatwright adjust to his new reality, Hunt-Vasquez has put him in contact with Palm Spring's local Swedish-American community at the Vasa Order of America's Desert Viking lodge in San Jacinto. His friend there, Viola Wyler, told MyDesert.com that despite lucid conversations, Boatwright suffers from detachment from reality. 'All of the events that he talked about, he has never been involved in it; he always feels that he is looking in,' Wyler said to MyDesert.com. Relief: Michael Boatwright uses exercise as the only way to concentrate his mind and not think about his memory loss. From their talks, Wyler surmises that he did indeed live in Sweden in the mid-1980s, but because he has no strong regional accent she thinks that he learned it late in life or has not used it much during his adult life. Even the photographs that he carries do not trigger his memory in any way. Despite the knowledge that he used to be a graphic designer and taught English as a second language, Boatwright has no memory of how to execute the skills he learned during his life. And sadly now, Hunt-Vasquez is worried that he may not be able to stay in the hospital much longer because, despite his amnesia, he is healthy. But, the hospital is also looking for other viable options - 'really try to avoid just him being in the streets.' For Boatwright, though, his daily life is a living hell. 'Walk in my shoes for one day,' he said. 'You'll experience the nightmare of a lifetime.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Michael Boatwright, a 61-year-old man, was found unconscious in a Palm Springs motel room and woke up with no memory of his life, only speaking Swedish.

However, as with other inventions such as the television and the computer, they are a double-edged sword, inviting both supporters and opponents, especially in regard to their use in public places like restaurants and cinemas. One of the strongest arguments in favor of forbidding mobiles in public places is the trouble they cause to other people. For example, although we are often asked to turn off our phones when in a cinema, the film that we are watching is often interrupted by the sound of at least five rings. To make it even worse, some people insist on continuing their conversation, even though hundreds of people can hear what they say, which often drowns out the voice from the film. As a result, many people would welcome a ban on mobile phones in places where they might disturb other people. On the other hand, there are a number of arguments against such a ban. It is difficult to stop people bringing with them their mobile phones in public places, making it almost impossible to call for a ban. Some people would see this as an infringement of their rights, while other people would say they need them in case of an emergency. Despite being asked to silence their phones, some people insist on leaving them on.  It seems to me that a ban on mobile phones would not have any result in the end. People will find a way to escape a ban. Nevertheless, people should be discouraged from using them in public places, unless it is highly necessary. They should be made to know that it is bad manners to use them in certain places or at certain times. Of course, there will always be someone who thinks their call is more important than others' peace and quiet!

ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.

How to refinish wood with a faux whitewash technique  Go thrift shopping.  Never whitewash wood that is in good condition. It will ruin your existing paint job or finish.","output":"Step 1: Find a suitable piece of wood furniture Search for a piece of wood furniture in the thrift store that has a worn or outdated finish, making it a good candidate for the faux whitewash technique. Step 2: Clean and sand the surface Before beginning the refinishing process, clean the piece of furniture thoroughly to remove any dirt or dust. Then, sand the surface using medium grit sandpaper to create a smooth and even surface. This step is crucial to ensure proper adhesion of the whitewash. Step 3: Gather materials and prepare work area Gather all the necessary materials for the faux whitewash technique, such as paint brushes, a paint tray, white paint, water, and a sealant. Prepare your work area by laying down a drop cloth to protect the floor and ensure proper ventilation. Step 4: Create whitewash mixture Mix equal parts of white paint and water in a paint tray to create the whitewash mixture. The consistency should be relatively thin to allow for easy application and penetration into the wood grain. Step 5: Apply whitewash to wood Using a paintbrush, apply the whitewash mixture to the wood furniture, following the direction of the wood grain. Work in small sections, as the mixture dries quickly. To achieve a more transparent effect, wipe off excess paint with a clean cloth before it dries. Step 6: Allow whitewash to dry Allow the whitewashed wood to dry completely. Depending on the humidity, it may take several hours or overnight. Step 7: Seal the whitewash Once the whitewashed surface is dry, apply a sealant over the surface to protect the whitewash and provide a durable finish. You can use a clear varnish or a water-based polyurethane for this purpose. Step 8: Reassemble the furniture After the sealant has dried, reassemble any parts of the furniture you may have removed during the refinishing process. In conclusion, the steps taken after the given paragraph involve finding a suitable piece of wood furniture, cleaning and sanding its surface, preparing the whitewash mixture, applying it to the wood, allowing it to dry, sealing the whitewash, and reassembling the furniture. This will give the piece a fresh, updated look without damaging the wood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jon had spent eight seasons breaking this ground to plant spring's crops and every year it got harder. Sweat beaded on his brow and he felt his cotton shirt stick to his skin under his coat. Jon took off his soft-brimmed hat and wiped his forehead. He examined the hat as he let his breath return. The hat had kept the burning sun and beating rain off his head for as long as Jon owned the farm. He wore it every day. It had been a gift given to him on the day he married Alasandra but he could not remember who gave it to him. Jon put it back on his head and pushed the tiller deep into the stubborn earth. Daven ran over the hill and down the cart path leading to their small cobblestone house. The boy had only left a short while ago and he held no sack with the bread and cheese his mother had told him to buy. Jon furrowed his brow. The boy continued to run and soon the wind carried his cry to his father's ears. \\"Papa! A carriage is coming! Two horses!\\" Jon's furrowed brow remained. Surely the boy meant a cart from a neighboring farm. No carriage made it out this far. \\"It's from the city! A soldier drives it!\\" Jon felt ice water flow over him. He turned to the house. \\"Sandra! Get the musket out of the pantry!\\" Jon saw his wife's face appear at one foggy window. Jon gestured wildly at her. \\"Get it!\\" They were too late.

Which path will be marched over less frequently?  Ricky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations.  Hint: In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication).  Over time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8] A:","output":"Path B will be marched over less frequently."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

Article: The low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise, low traffic installations. They are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight. The high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building’s electrical system. There are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground. Now answer this question: What else contributes to a higher demand from the electrical system?","output":"Imagine you have two toys, one is a small car that you can pull up a string, and the other is a toy that you can push up with your hand using water from a water gun. These toys can be like the two types of elevators, traction (the car on a string) and hydraulic (the water gun). The hydraulic elevator, the one with the water gun, uses a special pump to push the elevator up, just like you use the water gun to push the toy. But to do this, it needs a lot of energy, like when you have to squeeze the water gun really hard. This uses more electricity, which can be like the energy your flashlight uses when you turn it on - the more you need, the quicker your batteries run out. When the hydraulic elevator starts moving, it needs even more electricity, similar to when you first start pushing the water in your water gun. This creates a higher demand on the building's electrical system, like how your flashlight batteries would need more power if you wanted it to shine brighter. So, besides the high current draw of the pump when starting up, what else contributes to a higher demand from the electrical system is the constant need for more electricity to keep the hydraulic elevator working and pushing it upwards with the pump, similar to you using a water gun to lift up your toy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As she delves deeper into the clues and evidence, Annie faces professional and personal challenges that remind her of her own past. With several plot twists and suspects, she discovers the startling hidden truth that forces her to question her morals, loyalties, and identity. Overview: Annie Richardson is a skilled, intelligent, and beautiful District Attorney known for her unyielding determination to bring justice to those affected by crimes. A recent string of connected murders makes headlines in Annie's city, and she is assigned to oversee the case. Little does she know that this case will confront her with more than just a professional challenge as the investigation process unravels. The film begins with Annie taking charge of the investigation as new leads emerge. A mysterious informant provides her with information that causes her to suspect a well-known and powerful business tycoon, Victor Hallman, of authorizing the murders. Annie's boss and colleagues warn her about the political implications of targeting someone as influential as Victor, fearing it would jeopardize their careers. But Annie, driven by her commitment to justice and the law, proceeds to gather enough evidence to convict Victor and those involved. As she moves deeper into the case, strange connections to her own past start to surface - links that she'd been trying to bury for years. Annie's personal life gets entangled with her professional work when Victor attempts to blackmail her using the information from her past. As the pressure mounts, she starts to question whether her long-held beliefs in the justice system make her biased against Victor. Her relationships with her friends, family, and co-workers start to crumble as the truth gets increasingly twisted. One final piece of unexpected evidence reveals the truth: Victor is indeed a suspect, but these grisly murders are the work of multiple suspects. The true mastermind behind all this is a criminal organization that Annie's estranged father was once connected to. Annie's identity, motive, and desire for justice are all put into question as she delves deeper into her father's dark past. The final act of the movie sees Annie battling between her duty as a DA and her loyalty to her family name. She grapples with her moral compass, trying to make sense of what's right and wrong in the murky world of politics, crime, and law enforcement. In the end, Annie unearths the truth about her father's involvement with the organization and confronts the mastermind. Annie finally prosecutes everyone involved in the crime, including Victor, but the cost is losing her family legacy. She also rebuilds her relationships, learns to confront her past, and continues her quest for justice with newfound strength and wisdom. The Unveiling of Truth is a gripping thriller that explores the depth of human emotions, struggles, and the power of truth. It serves as a powerful reminder of the impact our past can have on our present and future, and the importance of staying true to oneself despite relentless outside pressures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: What became France's main rival on the imperial stage? is inside the article: Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain., can you guess it ? A:","output":"The main rival to France on the imperial stage was England, which later became known as Britain after 1707. This rivalry intensified during the Nine Years' War where both countries, previously allies, found themselves in the conflict with France, Spain, and the Anglo-Dutch alliance. The war left England as a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, reflecting it as France's main competitor.  This rivalrous relationship continued throughout the 18th century when Britain rose to be the world's leading colonial authority and France being its principal challenger. The situation further escalated when Charles II of Spain passed away in 1700 and left his resources and colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, who was a grandson of the French King. Unification of France, Spain, and their colonies was unacceptable for England and other European powers, leading to the War of the Spanish Succession, where England sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France.  As a result, important territories like Newfoundland, Acadia, Gibraltar, and Menorca were gained by Britain from France and Spain. Gibraltar's strategic location allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entrance and exit point to the Mediterranean, strengthening Britain's hold further. The right to the asiento, which granted British permission to trade slaves in Spanish America, also added to Britain's influence. Thus, in the context of imperial power struggles, Britain emerged as France's main rival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A coach containing Thomas Renfield (Peter MacNicol), a solicitor from London, and two Transylvanian natives, rocks up a mountanous path. Renfield says he's feeling queasy and one of the helpful natives leans out the window to tell the driver to slow down. Just as he does so, he catches a glimpse of the setting sun and yells for the driver to go faster. The carriage rocks and jerks its way to the closest town.When they arrive, a townsperson opens the door of the carriage, and Renfield tumbles out headfirst. The driver throws his luggage down after him, saying he will go no further tonight. Renfield is forced to walk to his appointment at Dracula's castle, disregarding the townspeople's warnings about vampires as a silly superstition.By the time Renfield arrives, it is dark. He tries to knock at the door, but the knocker crumbles away in his hand. Just then, the doors swing open of their own accord. When Renfield steps in, the doors swing shut again and he turns around in surprise. Behind him, at the top of a long staircase, Count Dracula (Leslie Nielsen) makes his appearance. He stands still at the top of the stairs as shadow creeps forward across the wall in a predatory stance. Dracula scolds it in a foreign tongue and it retreats. Renfield, startled, turns around and is relieved to see the count. Dracula starts to introduce himself and trips on some bat guano, tumbling down the steps. He gets up at Renfield's feet, unharmed. He leads Renfield up the staircase, while his shadow limps across the wall behind him.As they walk up the stairs Dracula passes without incident through a giant spiderweb that is in the way.

The cancelation is the second one for the show, which was dropped from Egyptian satellite channel CBC last October before resuming in February on the Saudi channel MBC Misr. Youssef said the team behind his show—which drew about 8.3 million viewers in Egypt, according to the polling agency Baseera—believes it’s better to call it quits than to carry on the program in another format or another country and risk harming its integrity.

Lecter was introduced in the 1981 thriller novel Red Dragon as a forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. The novel and its sequel, The Silence of the Lambs, feature Lecter as one of the primary antagonists after the two serial killers in both novels. In the third novel, Hannibal, Lecter becomes a protagonist. Context: Red Dragon firmly states that Lecter does not fit any known psychological profile. In The Silence of the Lambs, Lecter's keeper, Dr. Frederick Chilton, claims that Lecter is a \\"pure sociopath\\" (\\"pure psychopath\\" in the film adaptation). In the novel Red Dragon, protagonist Will Graham says that Lecter has no conscience and tortured animals as a child, but does not exhibit any other of the criteria traditionally associated with psychopathy; Graham explains that psychiatrists refer to Lecter as a sociopath because \\"they don't know what else to call him\\". In the film adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs, protagonist Clarice Starling says of Lecter, \\"They don't have a name for what he is.\\" In the novel The Silence of the Lambs, Barney Matthews, an orderly at the facility where Lecter is imprisoned, claims that the only thing Lecter fears is boredom.  Lecter's pathology is explored in greater detail in Hannibal and Hannibal Rising, which explains that he was traumatized as a child in Lithuania in 1944 when he witnessed the murder and cannibalism of his beloved sister, Mischa, by a group of deserting Lithuanian Hilfswillige, one of whom claimed that Lecter unwillingly ate his sister as well.  All media in which Lecter appears portray him as intellectually brilliant, cultured and sophisticated, with refined tastes in art, music and cuisine. He is frequently depicted preparing gourmet meals from his victims' flesh, the most famous example being his admission that he once ate a census taker's liver \\"with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\\" (a \\"big Amarone\\" in the novel). He is well-educated in Anatomy, Chemistry and Physics and also speaks several languages, including Italian, German, Russian, Polish, French, Spanish, and, to some extent, Japanese. He is deeply offended by rudeness, and frequently kills people who have bad manners. Prior to his capture and imprisonment, he was a member of Baltimore, Maryland's social elite, and a sitting member of the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra's board of directors.  In The Silence of the Lambs, Lecter is described through Starling's eyes: \\"small, sleek, and in his hands and arms she saw wiry strength like her own\\". The novel also reveals that Lecter's left hand has a condition called mid ray duplication polydactyly, i.e. a duplicated middle finger. In Hannibal, he performs plastic surgery on his own face on several occasions, and removes his extra digit. Lecter's eyes are a shade of maroon, and reflect the light in \\"pinpoints of red\\". He has small white teeth and dark, slicked-back hair with a widow's peak. He also has a keen sense of smell; in The Silence of the Lambs, he is able to identify through a plexiglass window with small holes the brand of perfume that Starling wore the day before. At one point, when Hannibal points out Clarice must have gotten a bruise lately, she suddenly remembers she has a band-aid on her covered leg, so she assumes he must have smelled it. He has an eidetic memory with which he has constructed in his mind an elaborate \\"memory palace\\" with which he relives memories and sensations in rich detail. Question: What was his personality like? Answer:","output":"Dr. Hannibal Lecter's personality is complex and multifaceted. Despite being a highly intelligent and cultured individual, he exhibits traits that make him a very dangerous and unpredictable person. His various characteristics can be discussed in terms of his intellect, sophistication, trauma, morality, and relationships with others. Intellect: Lecter is an exceptionally intelligent individual, possessing an eidetic memory and expertise in various fields, including anatomy, chemistry, physics, and languages. His intellect allows him to manipulate others and outsmart law enforcement officials. He is often several steps ahead of his pursuers and has no difficulty evading capture. Sophistication: Lecter is a connoisseur of art, music, and fine cuisine. He is well-educated and well-traveled, with an appreciation for high culture and refined tastes. This sophistication is often used as a facade to mask his darker, more sinister true nature. Trauma: The traumatic events in Lecter's childhood, particularly witnessing the murder and cannibalism of his sister Mischa, shaped his personality in profound ways. This trauma could be considered the origin of his cannibalistic tendencies and his obsession with violence. Morality: Lecter's moral compass is highly skewed, with an extreme intolerance for rudeness and a willingness to kill those he deems to have displayed bad manners. While he does exhibit a cold and ruthless nature, he also possesses a certain sense of honor, occasionally helping individuals he perceives as innocent or admirable, such as FBI agent Clarice Starling. His twisted sense of morality sets him apart from other serial killers and renders his actions unpredictable. Relationships: Lecter is highly manipulative and persuasive in his interactions with others, often using people as pawns to achieve his goals. Despite this, he is capable of forming genuine connections, as evidenced by his relationship with Clarice Starling.

By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

Nick helped Robert to develop defined abs, by following the workout routine he had designed for  OPT: a). Nick .. b). Robert ..","output":"b). Robert Nick, an experienced fitness coach and personal trainer, decided to help his friend Robert develop defined abs. He started by creating a customized workout routine designed for Robert's body type and fitness goals. Below are the step-by-step actions taken by Nick to ensure that Robert achieves his desired results. Step 1: Understanding Robert's fitness goals and body type Nick began by having a detailed conversation with Robert to learn about his fitness goals, current workout routine, and any challenges or limitations he was facing. He took note of Robert's body type, weight, and body fat percentage to better tailor a workout routine. Step 2: Designing a workout routine for Robert After gathering the necessary information, Nick crafted a workout routine that focused on exercises targeting the core muscles and helping to develop defined abs. He also incorporated a mix of cardiovascular exercises and strength training to promote overall fitness and fat loss. Step 3: Teaching Robert the workout routine Nick taught Robert the proper form and technique for each of the exercises included in the workout routine. They started with basic core exercises such as planks, leg raises, and reverse crunches to build a strong foundation. Gradually, Nick added more advanced exercises like hanging leg raises and Russian twists to challenge Robert and promote further core development. Step 4: Setting a workout schedule and consistency Nick emphasized the importance of consistency and adhering to the workout schedule to achieve desired results. He suggested that Robert perform the ab workout routine at least 3 times a week, while continuing a balance of cardio and strength training on other days. Step 5: Monitoring progress and making adjustments As Robert continued with his customized workout routine, Nick closely monitored his progress through regular check-ins and assessments. He adjusted exercises and intensity levels as needed to ensure that Robert continued to make progress and avoid plateaus. Step 6: Implementing a healthy eating plan Nick also stressed the importance of a healthy diet to complement the workout routine. They worked together to create a nutrition plan that focused on whole, unprocessed foods, lean protein, and plenty of fruits and vegetables, while minimizing processed sugars and unhealthy fats. Proper hydration and adequate rest were also emphasized to support recovery and overall well-being. Step 7: Celebrating milestones and keeping motivation high As Robert started to see progress in his ab definition, Nick celebrated these milestones with him. He consistently encouraged Robert to stay committed to his workout routine and diet plan, reminding him of the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle for long-term success. By following this customized workout routine and focusing on consistent effort, Robert began to see his abs become more defined.

Options: [i] dangerous [ii] storing water [iii] watershed [iv] kalenchoes [v] they bend [vi] rainy [vii] kinetic [viii] strong A:","output":"The best answer to the question, \\"What are rivers?\\" based on the hints provided by the teacher, would be option [iii] watershed.  The teacher mentioned that rivers are typically larger than streams and that watersheds consist of creeks, streams, and rivers. From this information, we can infer that rivers are an essential component of a watershed, which is a geographical region where water from various sources, such as creeks, streams, and rivers, flow towards a common outlet like a lake, sea, or ocean. It is important to note that this definition aligns with the concept of a river, as they consist of flowing water that often originates from a high elevation source, like a mountain or glacier, and moves downhill naturally due to gravity, joining other water bodies in their journey. Furthermore, we can exclude the other options from the list for a variety of reasons: [i] dangerous - Although some rivers may pose risks due to their force or location, this description does not inherently define the nature of a river. [ii] storing water - While rivers do indeed hold water, their main function is to transport water towards other bodies rather than simply storing it. [iv] kalenchoes - Kalenchoes are a type of succulent plant and are entirely unrelated to rivers. [v] they bend - While rivers tend to meander in their course, this characteristic isn't specific or comprehensive enough to define a river accurately. [vi] rainy - Rivers can be affected by rainy weather, but rain is not the sole determinant of a river's existence or function. [vii] kinetic - Although rivers possess kinetic energy due to their movement, the term 'kinetic' on its own doesn't encapsulate the full extent of what rivers are. [viii] strong - Similar to the option 'dangerous,' some rivers may be strong in terms of water volume and flow velocity, but this label does not sufficiently describe a river."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The ESA requires that critical habitat be designated at the time of or within one year of a species being placed on the endangered list.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"The presidential administration that limited the protective status of critical habitat in 1986 was that of President Ronald Reagan. To provide a more detailed and long answer, we need to discuss the background of the critical habitat concept and the changes implemented during Reagan's presidency. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted in 1973 to conserve endangered or threatened species and their ecosystems. Critical habitat is a key aspect of the ESA. It refers to specific geographic areas containing features essential to the conservation of an endangered or threatened species and which may require special management or protection. The ESA requires that critical habitat be designated at the time of, or within one year of, a species being listed as endangered. In the early years of the ESA, critical habitat designation faced some controversies. Despite the clear intention of Congress to ensure that critical habitat would play a central role in the conservation of endangered species, the practical implementation of the ESA had several issues. For instance, the tight deadline for critical habitat designation pressured the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to make hasty decisions, sometimes resulting in insufficient or incorrect data being used. Additionally, the critical habitat designation process often faced criticism from landowners and local governments concerned about property rights and development restrictions. In 1986, during Ronald Reagan's presidency, significant changes were made to the critical habitat rules. Reagan's administration was known for prioritizing economic growth and reducing regulations on businesses, which influenced the alteration of critical habitat regulations. The FWS and the NMFS, under the Reagan administration, developed new regulations which allowed the exclusion of critical habitat areas if the agencies determined that the benefits of excluding such areas outweighed the benefits of specifying them as part of the critical habitat. These changes focused on balancing the economic impact with species conservation, and the regulations required that the agencies conduct an economic impact analysis for every proposed critical habitat designation. These new regulations led to a significant decrease in the number of designated critical habitats during the 1980s. Critics argue that these changes weakened the protective status of critical habitat under the ESA by giving more weight to economic consideration and creating a more lenient approach to protecting habitats for endangered species. While Reagan's administration emphasized the need for balancing economic interests with conservation, it is essential to consider the long-term impacts of such alterations to assure that endangered and threatened species are adequately protected and can recover in the future."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Italian.

Due to the expiration of his contract with Interscope Records, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website.  Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is \\"still churning along\\", and that he had begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in the given scenario supposes that the fuel lines are cleaned out, which seems unrelated to the process of magma transforming into a volcano above the Earth's surface. To evaluate the potential effect of this supposed perturbation on the volcanic process, let us first revisit the steps involved in the formation of a volcano: 1. Magma rises through cracks in the Earth's crust - Magma forms when the Earth's mantle melts due to high pressure and temperature. Magma is less dense than the surrounding solid rock, causing it to rise through cracks in the Earth's crust. 2. The pressure causes plates to move - Tectonic plates are constantly in motion due to the convection currents created by the heated and highly viscous asthenosphere beneath the lithosphere. As a result, forces accumulate along plate boundaries, paving the way for several geological events, including volcanic activities. 3. Magma explodes to the surface - As magma rises, the pressure decreases, and the dissolved gases in magma form bubbles. When the pressure of these gas bubbles exceeds that of the surrounding rock, the magma can burst through the crust, causing a volcanic eruption. 4. The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust - When magma reaches the surface, it is referred to as lava. As the lava cools down over time, it solidifies, forming new crust on the Earth's surface. 5. After several eruptions, the rock builds up, and a volcano forms - Repeated volcanic eruptions cause buildup of molten rock, ash, and other volcanic materials. Over time, this accumulated material constructs a volcanic mountain, also known as a volcano. Now, let us assess the perturbation hypothesis's potential impact on this process. Cleaning out fuel lines is an activity related to mechanical maintenance and has no bearing on geological activities or forces acting under the Earth's surface. It is unrelated to the processes occurring within the Earth's mantle and crust, such as melting, magma generation, tectonic plate movement, or volcanic eruptions. Thus, it can be concluded that the supposed perturbation of cleaning out fuel lines would have no direct or indirect effect on the process of magma transforming into a volcano above the Earth's surface. The two systems (mechanical maintenance and geological activity) operate independently of each other and have no discernable connection or influence on one another."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: After World War II, German museums handed over artwork looted from Jews to the families of prominent Nazis responsible for the theft, often without demanding any proof of ownership, a British restitution group charged on Monday.      “It seems that Bavaria thought restitution meant restitution to the Nazis rather than to their victims,” a statement from the Commission for Looted Art in Europe said.      The deception began as soon as American authorities handed over the restitution task to the Bavarian administration in 1949, according to the report. Thousands of artworks were in question.      Reportedly, German authorities kept some and sold others at deflated prices, including to members of prominent Nazi families such as the widow of Hermann Göring and Henriette von Schirach (nee Hoffmann), the wife of Hitler’s district governor, or “Gauleiter,” in Vienna.      “Von Schirach was condemned at Nuremberg for crimes against humanity for the deportation of 60,000 Austrian Jews,” the London-based organization said.      The group traces the story of how von Schirach came by one small painting, “Picture of a Dutch Square,” by Johannes van der Heyden that originally belonged to a Czech-Jewish couple, the consul general to Vienna, Gottlieb Krause, and his wife, Mathilde. The Krause family fled to the United States in April 1938, putting their possessions in storage.      But the property was later confiscated by the Gestapo and artworks were sold to, among others, the planned “Führermuseum” in Linz, Austria, and to the father of von Schirach, Heinrich Hoffmann, Hitler’s official photographer and an art collector.      After the war, the painting was among the thousands of works to be returned to rightful heirs. But the Bavarian State Galleries sold it back to von Schirach for 300 Deutschmark, and she promptly auctioned it off for 16,000 Deutschmarks to the Xanten Cathedral Association; it was on display in the cathedral until 2011.      Meanwhile, the great-grandson of the Krauses, John Graykowski, has been seeking restitution of the family’s collection in vain.      “While their [the Nazi families] demands were dealt with promptly and efficiently and with little requirement to prove their claims of ownership, the looted families had their claims thrown out or impossible hurdles created to prevent them recovering their artworks. The families are still experiencing the same barriers to recovery of their looted works of art today,” a statement from CLAE said.      In a joint probe, the Munich-based newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and the British NGO Commission for Looted Art in Europe also found that the Bavarian State Galleries and many other such institutions have been sitting on art that was forcibly “purchased” from Jewish collectors under the Nazi regime.      The museums have tried to disguise the origin of the artworks, and even sold some of them without seeking the rightful owners or their heirs, according to the investigation. ||||| \\"Monuments Men\\" redirects here. For the film, see The Monuments Men      The Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program under the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the Allied armies was established in 1943 to help protect cultural property in war areas during and after World War II. The group of approximately 400 service members and civilians worked with military forces to safeguard historic and cultural monuments from war damage, and as the conflict came to a close, to find and return works of art and other items of cultural importance that had been stolen by the Nazis or hidden for safekeeping.      Many of the men and women of the MFAA, also known as Monuments Men, went on to have prolific careers. Largely art historians and museum personnel, they had formative roles in the growth of many of the United States’ greatest cultural institutions, including the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the New York City Ballet, as well as in museums and other institutions in Europe.      Formation [ edit ]      Even before the U.S. entered World War II, art professionals and organizations such as the American Defense Harvard Group and the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) were working to identify and protect European art and monuments in harm’s way or in danger of Nazi plundering. The groups sought a national organization affiliated with the military which would have the same goal. Francis Henry Taylor, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, took their concerns to Washington, D.C. Their efforts ultimately led to the establishment by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the \\"American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas\\" on June 23, 1943.      What began as a brain trust of the art world’s finest during the war became a group of 345 men and women from 13 countries that comprised the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section unit. They spent 1945 seeking out more than 1,000 troves containing an estimated 5 million pieces of artwork and cultural items stolen from wealthy Jews, museums, universities, and religious institutions. And for six years after the surrender, a smaller group of about 60 Monuments Men continued scouring Europe as art detectives.[1]      Commonly referred to as the Roberts Commission after its chairman, Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts, the group was charged with promoting the preservation of cultural properties in war areas, including the European, Mediterranean, and Far Eastern Theaters of Operations, providing that this mission did not interfere with military operations. Headquartered at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., the Commission drew up lists of and reports on European cultural treasures and provided them to military units, in hopes that these monuments would be protected whenever possible.      The Commission helped establish the MFAA branch within the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the Allied armies, led by Major L. Bancel LaFarge. After the war, the Roberts Commission helped the MFAA and Allied Forces return Nazi-confiscated artworks to rightful owners. It also promoted public awareness of looted cultural works. The group was dissolved in June 1946, when the State Department took over its duties and functions.      General Dwight D. Eisenhower facilitated the work of the MFAA by forbidding looting, destruction, and billeting in structures of cultural significance. He also repeatedly ordered his forces to assist the MFAA as much as possible. This was the first time in history an army attempted to fight a war and at the same time reduce damage to cultural monuments and property.      \\"Prior to this war, no army had thought of protecting the monuments of the country in which and with which it was at war, and there were no precedents to follow.... All this was changed by a general order issued by Supreme Commander-in-Chief [General Eisenhower] just before he left Algiers, an order accompanied by a personal letter to all Commanders...the good name of the Army depended in great measure on the respect which it showed to the art heritage of the modern world.\\"[2]      —Lt. Col. Sir Leonard Woolley, Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Officer      War operations [ edit ]      As Allied Forces made their way through Europe, liberating Nazi-occupied territories, Monuments Men were present in very small numbers at the front lines. Lacking handbooks, resources, or supervision, this initial handful of officers relied on their museum training and overall resourcefulness to perform their tasks. There was no established precedent for what they confronted. They worked in the field under the Operations Branch of SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, Europe, commanded by Eisenhower), and were actively involved in battle preparations. In preparing to take Florence, which was used by the Nazis as a supply distribution center due to its central location in Italy, Allied troops relied on aerial photographs provided by the MFAA which were marked with monuments of cultural importance so that pilots could avoid damaging such sites during bombings.      When damage to monuments did occur, MFAA personnel worked to assess damage and buy time for the eventual restoration work that would follow. Monuments officer Deane Keller had a prominent role in saving the Campo Santo in Pisa after a mortar round started a fire that melted the lead roof, which then bled down the iconic 14th century fresco-covered walls. Keller led a team of Italian and American troops and restorers in recovering the remaining fragments of the frescoes and in building a temporary roof to protect the structure from further damage. Restoration of the frescoes continues even today.      Countless other monuments, churches, and works of art were saved or protected by the dedicated personnel of the MFAA section. Frequently entering liberated towns and cities ahead of ground troops, Monuments Men worked quickly to assess damage and make temporary repairs before moving on with Allied Armies as they conquered Nazi territory.      Art repositories [ edit ]      American and allied forces in Europe discovered hidden caches of priceless treasures. Many were the product of looting by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Others had been legitimately evacuated from museums for safekeeping. Monuments Men oversaw the safeguarding, cataloguing, removal and packing of all works from all these repositories.      In Italy, museum officials had sent their holdings to various countryside locations such as the Tuscan villa of Montegufoni, which housed some of the Florentine collections. As Allied forces advanced through Italy, the German army retreated north, stealing paintings and sculptures from these repositories as they fled. As German forces neared the Austrian border, they were forced to store most of their loot in various hiding places, such as a castle at Sand in Taufers and a jail cell in San Leonardo.      Beginning in late March 1945, Allied forces began discovering these hidden repositories in what would become the \\"greatest treasure hunt in history\\". In Germany alone, U.S. forces found about 1,500 repositories of art and cultural objects looted from institutions and individuals across Europe, as well as German and Austrian museum collections that had been evacuated for safekeeping. Soviet forces also made discoveries, such as treasures from the extraordinary Dresden Transport Museum.      Some of the repositories discovered by Monuments Men in Germany, Austria, and Italy were:      Restitutions [ edit ]      In early May 1945, Lt. Col. Geoffrey Webb, British MFAA chief at Eisenhower’s headquarters, proposed that U.S forces quickly prepare buildings in Germany so that they might receive large shipments of artworks and other cultural property found in the numerous repositories. Eisenhower directed his subordinates to immediately begin preparing such buildings, ordering that art objects were to be handled only by MFAA personnel. Suitable locations with little damage and adequate storage space were difficult to find.      By July 1945, U.S. forces had established two central collecting points within the U.S. Zone in Germany: Munich and Wiesbaden. Secondary collecting points were also established in various German towns, including: Bad Wildungen, Heilbronn, Marburg, Nuremberg, and Oberammergau. One of the more critical of these secondary collecting points was at Offenbach, where officials processed millions of Nazi-looted books, archives, manuscripts, Jewish objects such as Torah scrolls, and property seized from Masonic lodges.      In summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at Wiesbaden. When his superiors ordered that he send to the U.S. 202 German-owned paintings in his custody, Farmer and 35 others who were in charge of the Wiesbaden collection point gathered to draw up what has become known as the Wiesbaden manifesto on 7 November 1945, declaring \\"We wish to state that, from our own knowledge, no historical grievance will rankle so long or be the cause of so much justified bitterness as the removal for any reason of a part of the heritage of any nation even if that heritage may be interpreted as a prize of war.\\" Among the co-signers was Lt. Charles Percy Parkhurst of the U.S. Navy.[3][4]      Once an object arrived at a collecting point, it was recorded, photographed, studied, and sometimes conserved so that it could be returned to its country of origin as soon as possible. Some objects were easily identifiable and could be quickly returned, such as the Veit Stoss Altar of Veit Stoss from St. Mary's Basilica in Kraków, which had been discovered in the Nuremberg Castle. Others, such as unmarked paintings or library collections, were much more difficult to process. Among the facilities were:      Munich Central Collecting Point (MCP): Monuments officer Lt. Craig Hugh Smyth established the MCP in July 1945. He converted the former Führerbau , which housed Hitler’s office, into a functional art depot complete with photography studios and conservation labs. This facility primarily housed art stolen by the ERR from private collections and Hitler’s collection found at Altaussee.      , which housed Hitler’s office, into a functional art depot complete with photography studios and conservation labs. This facility primarily housed art stolen by the ERR from private collections and Hitler’s collection found at Altaussee. Wiesbaden Collecting Point (WCP): Monuments officer Capt. Walter Farmer helped establish this facility in July 1945. Art from the Berlin museums and other items found in the mines at Merkers were processed here. Museum collections stored at Siegen and Grasleben also were sent to Wiesbaden.      Offenbach Collecting Point (OCP), also known as the Offenbach Archival Depot: Established in July 1945 in the I.G. Farben building on the Main River just outside Frankfurt, Offenbach primarily served as an archival depot. Because the OCP housed the largest collection of Jewish cultural property in the world, including the entire holdings of the Rothschild Library in Frankfurt and cultural objects from Masonic lodges, restitutions were complicated. Identification of the millions of books, religious objects and other materials was tedious. Many of the owners had become victims of the Holocaust leaving no one alive to pursue claims. The facility was closed in 1948 and its remaining unclaimed items were transferred to Wiesbaden.      Occupation of Japan [ edit ]      As the war neared its end in Japan in 1945, George Stout and fellow Monuments Man Major Laurence Sickman recommended creating an MFAA division there. Consequently, the Arts and Monuments Division of the Civil Information and Education Section of GHQ of the Supreme Command of the Allied Powers in Tokyo was established. Stout was the Chief of the Division from about August 1945 until the middle of 1946.[5]      Langdon Warner, archaeologist and curator of Oriental art at Harvard’s Fogg Museum, advised the MFAA Section in Japan from April to September 1946. Other members who served in Tokyo’s Arts and Monuments Division include Howard Hollis, Lt. Col. Harold Gould Henderson, Lt. Sherman Lee, and Lt. Patrick Lennox Tierney.[5][6][7]      MFAA personnel [ edit ]      The American museum establishment led the efforts to create the MFAA section. Included in this group were current museum directors, curators and art historians, as well as those who aspired to join their ranks. Upon returning home from service overseas, these men and women led the creation or improvement of some of the leading cultural institutions in the United States. Many major museums employed one or more MFAA officers before or after the war, including the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Toledo Museum of Art, and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.      Many other Monuments Men were professors at esteemed universities such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, New York University, Williams College, and Columbia University, among others. Paul J. Sachs’ famous \\"Museum Course\\" at Harvard educated dozens of future museum personnel in the decades preceding World War II. S. Lane Faison's passion for art history was passed on to hundreds of students and future museum leaders at Williams College in the 1960s and 1970s, some of whom are currently directors at major United States museums.      Other MFAA personnel became founders, presidents, and members of cultural institutions such as the New York City Ballet, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, the American Association of Museums, the American Association of Museum Directors, the Archaeological Institute of America, the Society of Architectural Historians, the American Society of Landscape Architects, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as respected artists, architects, musicians, and archivists.      Two monuments officers were killed in Europe, both near the front lines of the Allied advance into Germany: Captain Walter Huchthausen, an American scholar and architect attached to the U.S. 9th Army, was killed in April 1945 by small arms fire somewhere north of Essen and east of Aachen, Germany;[8] and Major Ronald Edmond Balfour, a British scholar attached to the Canadian First Army, was killed in March 1945 by an explosion in Cleves, Germany.[9]      Monuments Men Congressional Gold Medal, presented 9 June 2014.

Entrusted with returning about 10,600 artworks to the original owners after the Monuments Men left Germany, Bavaria’s State Paintings Collections instead gave away or sold property looted from Jews to Germans—including to some prominent Nazis, the London-based Commission for Looted Art in Europe (Clae) has revealed. Claims by the heirs of the original Jewish owners and requests for information are still frequently stonewalled, says Anne Webber of Clae.            Clae uncovered this history, first reported by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, while investigating a painting of a Dutch square by Jan van der Heyden, currently in the possession of the cathedral in Xanten, a small town in North Rhine-Westphalia. It once belonged to the Jewish Kraus family, who fled Vienna in 1938. Their possessions were seized and sold to benefit the Nazi regime.            Dutch Square was purchased by Heinrich Hoffmann, Hitler’s personal photographer, whose daughter Henriette married Baldur von Schirach, the Reich Youth Leader. After the war, Hoffmann’s collection was seized by the Allies, along with those of other prominent Nazis, and entered the custody of the Monuments Men. The Monuments Men passed responsibility for restituting the thousands of artworks still in their care to the Bavarian state when they left Germany.            But instead of restituting them to the original Jewish owners, the Bavarian State Paintings Collections returned them to the Nazis who had immorally acquired them, or sold them to other buyers. Henriette von Schirach bought back Dutch Square, along with dozens more artworks, furniture and carpets. Other members of the family successfully reclaimed artworks from Hoffmann’s collection. Emmy Göring, the wife of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, also filed claims, though the Bavarian State Paintings Collections denies researchers access to the archives that would reveal whether she was successful, Webber says.            \\"It is particularly striking that the Hoffmann family was getting virtually everything back that it claimed with minimal proof of ownership and this went on for almost two decades,” Webber says. “The burden of proof was much higher for claims from Jewish families—from the victims of these Nazi leaders.\\"            Von Schirach sold Dutch Square a few months after recovering it. It was purchased by the Xanten cathedral community, which has so far rejected a claim by the grandson of the Kraus couple, despite watertight proof of his family’s ownership.            “The family feels that every possible German institution has been denying them justice,” Webber says.            Update: The Bavarian State Paintings Collections rejected accusations that it has hindered restitution of Nazi-looted art, saying it is committed to finding “fair and just solutions” with the heirs of those who were robbed, in accordance with the international Washington Principles. In a statement issued on 28 June, the museum authority said it will continue to strive to be “as transparent as possible” in its investigation of art seized from leading Nazis and said it has already published a report on the Göring collection, including information on property returned to family members. The State Paintings Collections rejected the accusation it denies the heirs of Jewish collectors access to its archives, saying researchers are permitted entry “on request and after making an appointment”.             ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A long time ago, there was a big war called World War II.

Paul Klee (German: [paUl 'kle:]; 18 December 1879 - 29 June 1940) was a Swiss German artist. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory (Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre), published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture. In 1919, Klee applied for a teaching post at the Academy of Art in Stuttgart. This attempt failed but he had a major success in securing a three-year contract (with a minimum annual income) with dealer Hans Goltz, whose influential gallery gave Klee major exposure, and some commercial success. A retrospective of over 300 works in 1920 was also notable.  Klee taught at the Bauhaus from January 1921 to April 1931. He was a \\"Form\\" master in the bookbinding, stained glass, and mural painting workshops and was provided with two studios. In 1922, Kandinsky joined the staff and resumed his friendship with Klee. Later that year the first Bauhaus exhibition and festival was held, for which Klee created several of the advertising materials. Klee welcomed that there were many conflicting theories and opinions within the Bauhaus: \\"I also approve of these forces competing one with the other if the result is achievement.\\"  Klee was also a member of Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four), with Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Alexej von Jawlensky; formed in 1923, they lectured and exhibited together in the USA in 1925. That same year, Klee had his first exhibits in Paris, and he became a hit with the French Surrealists. Klee visited Egypt in 1928, which impressed him less than Tunisia. In 1929, the first major monograph on Klee's work was published, written by Will Grohmann.  Klee also taught at the Dusseldorf Academy from 1931 to 1933, and was singled out by a Nazi newspaper, \\"Then that great fellow Klee comes onto the scene, already famed as a Bauhaus teacher in Dessau. He tells everyone he's a thoroughbred Arab, but he's a typical Galician Jew.\\" His home was searched by the Gestapo and he was fired from his job. His self-portrait Struck from the List (1933) commemorates the sad occasion. In 1933-4, Klee had shows in London and Paris, and finally met Pablo Picasso, whom he greatly admired. The Klee family emigrated to Switzerland in late 1933.  Klee was at the peak of his creative output. His Ad Parnassum (1932) is considered his masterpiece and the best example of his pointillist style; it is also one of his largest, most finely worked paintings. He produced nearly 500 works in 1933 during his last year in Germany. However, in 1933, Klee began experiencing the symptoms of what was diagnosed as scleroderma after his death. The progression of his fatal disease, which made swallowing very difficult, can be followed through the art he created in his last years. His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures. In the later 1930s, his health recovered somewhat and he was encouraged by a visit from Kandinsky and Picasso. Klee's simpler and larger designs enabled him to keep up his output in his final years, and in 1939 he created over 1,200 works, a career high for one year. He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color. His varied color palettes, some with bright colors and others sober, perhaps reflected his alternating moods of optimism and pessimism. Back in Germany in 1937, seventeen of Klee's pictures were included in an exhibition of \\"Degenerate art\\" and 102 of his works in public collections were seized by the Nazis.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The US company iRobot made a new kind of sub-marine  , called the Seaglider, last week.     The robotic submarine was developed by researchers at the University of Washington. It is about 1.8 meters long and weighs about 52 kilograms. It moves through water at a speed of up to 20-25 kilometers a day and can stay at sea for up to six months before needing a battery recharged. This special character results from its special propulsion system  . Unlike a traditional submarine, the Seaglider does not have a propeller  . It has an air tank that is emptied and filled to adjust   depth, as well as a pair of wings that help to guide and lead the submarine.     A traditional submarine, on the other hand, \\"puts water inside tanks to make it heavier, or it will expel   the water to make it lighter,\\" explained Frederick, a professor at the University of Washington.     Each time the Seaglider comes to the surface, it sends the data which it collects to its controllers by satellite. Operators can also send the submarine new information. For example, they can change its course in their office through giving the computer orders.     Seagliders are already being used for scientific research, such as environmental studies. iRobot also hopes to sell the submarine to the military  . At 100,000 each, the Seaglider is a cheap way to keep an eye on the ocean.     \\"These things can go out there and monitor   large areas of ocean because they're very persistent.

A 'vězenkyně' means a 'female prisoner' in Czech. The verb 'zorganizovala' refers to the past tense of 'organized' for a female subject. 'Rozruch' is a noun in Czech language that stands for 'riot' or 'disturbance' in English. So the phrase 'Vězenkyně zorganizovala rozruch' translates into 'The female prisoner organized a riot'. The conjunction 'aby' in Czech is used to describe a purpose or an aim, akin to 'to' or 'so as to' in English. Following this conjunction is 'si opatřila bezpečnostní kartu.' Here, 'si opatřila' is a past tense reflexive verb referring to a female subject that means 'got for herself' or 'procured for herself.' 'Bezpečnostní karta' translates to 'security card,' which possibly refers to a card granting certain access or privilege within the prison. So when you put it all together, the sentence 'Vězenkyně zorganizovala rozruch, aby si opatřila bezpečnostní kartu' in English means 'The female prisoner organized a riot to get herself a security card'. This English sentence implies that the female prisoner incited a riot in order to create a situation in which she could obtain a security card."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands.  Which parcel of land didn't have an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers? Answer:","output":"Based on the description provided, it can be inferred that Bill's parcel of land, which is covered with grasslands, is less likely to have an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers.  Grasslands generally have a better balance of water retention and drainage due to the vegetation and root structures, which help to prevent water from pooling on the surface or percolating too rapidly through soil layers. The roots of grasses create channels that facilitate water infiltration, while also binding the soil particles together, which increases stability and reduces erosion. On the other hand, forested land, like Tom's parcel, can potentially hold excess water due to the presence of trees with deeper root systems and a thick layer of organic matter on the forest floor. This can lead to slower water infiltration and increased water retention, which may cause water to percolate downward more slowly through the soil layers. However, it is important to note that various factors, such as the type of soil, slope of the land, and the specific plant species present, can influence the water dynamics on both parcels of land."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Paragraph:    For several years the arsenal , which was owned by the federal government , served as a simple arms depot and was staffed with only a handful of soldiers . But in November 1860 , with the American Civil War on the horizon , a company of the Second United States Artillery , consisting of sixty @-@ five men , was transferred to Little Rock under the command of Captain James Totten . On January 15 , 1861 , the state legislature decided to hold a referendum to determine if a state convention should be held to consider the issue of secession and to elect delegates to such a convention . It was planned for February 18 ; however , events at the arsenal , would not wait . On January 28 , then Governor Henry Massey Rector informed Captain Totten that he and his soldiers would be \\" permitted to remain in the possession of the Federal officers until the State , by authority of the people , shall have determined to sever their connection with the General Government , \\" Totten responded to this by telling the Governor that his orders came from the United States Government and began a desperate but ultimately futile dispatch of letters and telegrams asking for reinforcements , although rumors were widely spread that they were already coming . The first telegraph wire to span between Little Rock and Memphis had recently been completed . Local attorney John M Harrel was asked to compose the first telegraph dispatched from Arkansas 's capital . In his message , Harrel reported unconfirmed rumors that more federal troops had been sent to reinforce the Little Rock Arsenal .   The United States troops at the outposts of the western frontier of the state and in the Indian nation have all been recalled from winter quarters to reinforce the garrison at Fort Smith . The garrison at Fort Smith had been previously transferred to the United States Arsenal in this city ( Little Rock ) . The arsenal is one of the richest depositories of military stores in the United States and is supposed to be the ultimate destination of the tropps [ sic ] ordered from the frontier .   -John M Harrel Telegram , January 31 , 1861   The item was intended simply as a piece of news , but telegraph lines quickly spread the news throughout the state , fueling procession sentiment . The rumor was interpreted by some Arkansans as a call from the governor to assemble to help expel the federal troops from the arsenal . By February 5 , six militia units , consisting of 1 @,@ 000 men , with a guarantee that the numbers could be increased to 5 @,@ 000 if the situations deemed it necessary , had assembled in Little Rock . Governor Rector vehemently denied ordering the troops to assemble or giving any order at all in connection with the troops . Faced with the fact that the military had assembled believing they were following his orders and the consensus of the citizens of Little Rock against any armed conflict between the civilian army and federal troops , Governor Rector was forced to take control of the situation . On February 6 , he sent a formal demand for surrender of the arsenal to Captain Totten ,   This movement is prompted by the feeling that pervades the citizens of this State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be under the control of the State authorities , in order to their security . This movement , although not authorized by me , has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty , as the executive of this Sate , to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command . I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities , to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next .   Perhaps because Abraham Lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as President , Captain Totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops . He agreed to surrender the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three provisions :   The governor would take possession of the arsenal in the name of the United States .   The soldiers would be allowed safe passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property besides munitions of war .   The soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under orders , not as conquered and surrendering soldiers .   On the morning of February 8 , 1861 , Rector and Totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials . That afternoon , the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with Governor Rector at its head . All of the federal troops had left at this point , except Totten who had stayed behind to listen to the Governor 's speech and to hand the arsenal over in person .   The Little Rock Arsenal was classified in 1860 as an \\" arsenal of deposit , \\" meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis . Thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs , nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the Arsenal fell into State hands . Most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the Arkansas Military Board .   Inside the Little Rock Arsenal after its seizure in February , 1861 , the Confederates inventoried some 10 @,@ 247 weapons , 250 @,@ 000 musket cartridges , and 520 @,@ 000 percussion caps , as well as the four bronze cannon of Totten 's battery . Long arms in the Arsenal 's inventory consisted of :   M1822 .69 cal ( flintlock ) 5 @,@ 625   M1822 .69 cal ( percussion @-@ converted ) 53   M1842 .69 cal smoothbore ( percussion ) 357   M1855 .58 cal rifle @-@ muskets 900   M1817 common rifles 125   M1841 rifle ( \\" Mississippi Rifle \\" ) 54   M1847 musketoon 2   Hall 's carbines 267   Hall 's rifles ( flintlock ) 2 @,@ 864   Total 10 @,@ 247   Of this number , approximately 9600 weapons were serviceable , or ready @-@ for @-@ issue . Note there were only 1 @,@ 364 percussion weapons available . Disposition of the weapons found in the Arsenal is somewhat sketchy , but from various records it can be surmised that the 5th , 6th , 7th , and 8th Arkansas Infantry Regiments , mustered in June , 1861 , were issued M1816 / M1822 .69 caliber flintlocks . The 9th and 10th Arkansas , four companies of Kelly 's 9th Arkansas Battalion , and the 3rd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment were issued flintlock Hall 's Rifles . The units comprising the infantry force of Van Dorn 's Army of the West were the 1st and 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles were also armed with M1822 flintlocks from the Little Rock Arsenal . By the time the 11th and 12th Arkansas Infantry Regiments mustered in at Little Rock , the supply of arms had been almost completely exhausted , and only old \\" junker \\" weapons were left .   Most of the equipment , arms , and machinery at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to east of the Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn in April and May 1862 , and accountability for it is lost at that point . By all appearances , the equipment was sent down the river to Napoleon , Arkansas , and from there to Jackson Mississippi , where it was probably destroyed during the Vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863 .   Major General Thomas C. Hindman , sent to command the district of Arkansas in May , 1862 , found the state nearly destitute of military material . Hindman established another armory at Arkadelphia , and revived the Little Rock Arsenal as a collection point and depot for armaments and ammunition manufacture for small arms . Hindman recorded :   \\" Machinery was made for manufacturing percussion caps and small arms , and both were turned out in small quantity , but of excellent quality . Lead mines were opened and worked , and a chemical laboratory was established and successfully operated in aid of the Ordnance Department and in the manufacture of calomel , castor oil , spirits of nitre , the various tinctures of iron , and other valuable medicines . Most of these works were located at or near Arkadelphia on the Ouachita River , 75 miles south from Little Rock . The tools , machinery , and the material were gathered piecemeal or else made by hand labor . Nothing of this sort had been before attempted on Government account in Arkansas to my knowledge , except for the manufacture of small arms , the machinery for which was taken away by General Van Dorn and there was neither capital nor sufficient enterprise among the citizens to engage in such undertakings � A further supply , along with lead and caps , was procured from the citizens of Little Rock and vicinity by donation , purchases , and impressments .   This ammunition , and that which I brought with me , was rapidly prepared for use at the Laboratory established at the Little Rock Arsenal for that purpose . As illustrating as the pitiful scarcity of material in the country , the fact may be stated that it was found necessary to use public documents of the State Library for cartridge paper . Gunsmiths were employed or conscripted , tools purchased or impressed , and the repair of the damaged guns I brought with me and about an equal number found at Little Rock commenced at once . But , after inspecting the work and observing the spirit of the men I decided that a garrison 500 strong could hold out against Fitch and that I would lead the remainder - about 1500 - to Gen 'l Rust as soon as shotguns and rifles could be obtained from Little Rock instead of pikes and lances , with which most of them were armed . Two days elapsed before the change could be effected . \\"   The Confederate ordnance establishment at Little Rock was reactivated in August , 1862 . Looking around for a suitable person to head this activity , General Hindman turned to the Confederate Navy and borrowed Lieutenant John W. Dunnington . Lt. Dunnington was the commander of the gunboat C.S.S. Ponchartrain , which had been brought to Little Rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad . Dunnington was selected to head the ordnance works at Little Rock , and although he continued to draw his pay from the Confederate Navy Department , he was placed in charge of all Confederate ordnance activities ( which included artillery functions ) there with the rank of lieutenant colonel .   Lt. Col. Dunnington 's \\" Returns for the month of August , 1862 , at Little Rock Arsenal , C.S.A. , \\" are found in Vol . 149 , Chapter IV of the \\" Captured Rebel Ordnance Records , \\" and are most enlightening as to the scope of Confederate ordnance activities at Little Rock during this crucial time . According to Dunnington , \\" When I assumed command at this Post , all material had been removed to Arkadelphia . There were no persons employed . No shops were open for repair of arms or for fabricating ammunition . Material , tools , etc . , had to be procured as well as the employment of laborers . Work commenced the last part of the month . \\"   The military force at Little Rock under Dunnington 's command consisted of four officers : himself , Major John B. Lockman , Captain C.C. Green , and 2nd Lt. W.W. Murphy . In addition to these , he had 20 enlisted men and a civilian force composed of a foreman , 2 clerks , 3 gunsmiths for repairing small arms , a laboratorian , 26 laborers in the ammunition laboratory , and a carpenter for making packing boxes .   During the month of August , 1862 , the following work was performed : \\" Fabricated : one pair of musket bullet moulds ; 10 @,@ 000 buck & ball shot cartridges ; repaired : 750 muskets , shotguns , and rifles ; received and repaired : ordnance stores and ordnances ; performed : guard , office , and police duties ; inspected : Posts at Camden and Arkadelphia . \\"   Lt. Col. Dunnington continued to build up his works at Little Rock until November 1862 , when Captain Sanford C. Faulkner ( composer of The Arkansas Traveler ) was placed in charge of the Arsenal . Dunnington presumably returned to his naval duties and the Ponchartrain .   A \\" Summary of the Work Done for November , 1862 , Little Rock Arsenal \\" shows : Fabrication :   75 @,@ 000 buck & ball cartridges - percussion   14 @,@ 000 buck & ball cartridges - flint   275 paper fuzes   117 rounds , 6 @-@ pounder canister shot   130 rounds , 6 @-@ pounder ball shot   96 ammunition packing boxes   Repaired :   2 @,@ 236 shotguns and rifles ( repaired mostly for troops in service )   23 pistols ( repaired mostly for troops in service )   Received & Issued :   752 packages of ordnance and ordnance stores received and mostly issued to troops in service .   Repaired and painted :   4 gun carriages   Performed :   Guard , office , and police duties .   Perhaps the most illuminating points of the above \\" Summary of Work \\" and those for following months are that the standard ammunition made was . \\" buck & ball \\" , indicating that the .69 caliber smoothbores and shotguns remained the predominant caliber weapon in use , and of this , nearly one sixth or more of all small arms ammunition was still for flintlock weapons , indicating that no less than a sixth of the Confederate troops in this vicinity were still armed with obsolete flintlock weapons .   The \\" Summaries of Work done at Little Rock Arsenal , C.S.A. \\" continue at about the same pace and scale from August 1862 until August 1863 . Appended to the \\" Summary \\" for August , 1863 is the ominous notation , \\" During the last week in the month , nearly all stores at the Arsenal have been packed and sent to Arkadelphia , in obedience to orders from Chief of Ordnance , District of Arkansas . \\" This then marks the beginning of the evacuation of ordnance activities from Little Rock , with the city being surrendered to the advancing Federal troops of Frederick Steele 's Arkansas Expedition on September 11 , 1863 .   In 1864 , after Little Rock fell to the Union Army and the arsenal had been recaptured , General Fredrick Steele marched 8 @,@ 500 troops from the arsenal beginning the Camden Expedition .   The arsenal was briefly seized once more by Joseph Brooks loyalists during the Brooks @-@ Baxter War of 1874 .   Question: what is the suitable title of the passage ?

Question:   If Milo increases the number of crests of his wave, what happens to the frequency of his wave increases or decreases?    Text:  Wave frequency can be measured by counting the number of crests or compressions that pass the point in 1 second or other time period. The higher the number is, the greater is the frequency of the wave. The answer to this question is:","output":"If Milo increases the number of crests of his wave, the frequency of his wave will increase.  This conclusion can be drawn from the information provided in the text, which states that \\"wave frequency can be measured by counting the number of crests or compressions that pass the point in 1 second or other time period.\\" Additionally, the text mentions, \\"the higher the number is, the greater is the frequency of the wave.\\" When Milo increases the number of crests in his wave, he is essentially packing more oscillations into the same time period. This increase in the number of crests will correlate with a higher frequency, as the wave would be completing more cycles per unit of time. In the context of waves, a crest is the highest point or the peak of the wave, where the opposite is a trough, the lowest point. The relationship between the number of crests (or cycles) and frequency can be quantitatively expressed through the formula: Frequency (f) = Number of crests (N) / Time period (T) In this formula, the frequency is directly proportional to the number of crests and inversely proportional to the time period. As the number of crests increases, the frequency will also increase, keeping the time period constant. An increased frequency represents a more rapidly oscillating wave and may have different characteristics than a wave with a lower frequency, such as higher energy and a shorter wavelength. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the text and the fundamental understanding of wave frequency, by increasing the number of crests of his wave, Milo will effectively increase the frequency of his wave."},{"instruction":"Q:I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

OPTIONS:  1). no  2). yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and Question 2 are indeed asking the same thing, both seeking advice on how to improve digestion. In order to provide a detailed and long answer for the topic of improving digestion, I'll combine the responses to both questions. Improving your digestion is essential for better overall health, as it allows your body to extract the necessary nutrients from the food you eat more efficiently. There are several ways to improve digestion, and here are some of the most effective methods: 1. Eat a balanced and varied diet: Consuming a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats can help improve your digestion. These foods provide the essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients your body needs for optimal digestive function. 2. Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water throughout the day helps your body break down and digest food more efficiently. Aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water per day, and more if you're active. 3. Consume fiber: Eating a fiber-rich diet can help prevent constipation and maintain regular bowel movements. Fiber can be found in whole-grain products, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. 4. Incorporate probiotics: Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that promote a healthy balance of gut flora. They can be found in foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi, or taken as supplements. 5. Eat mindfully: Chew your food thoroughly and eat at a moderate pace. This allows your body to break down the food more easily and can prevent overeating. 6. Limit processed foods and added sugars: These foods can negatively affect digestion and may contribute to an imbalance of gut bacteria. Opting for whole, unprocessed foods can lead to better digestive health. 7. Manage stress: High stress levels can negatively impact digestion. Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga to help reduce stress. 8. Engage in regular physical activity: Exercise helps stimulate the natural contractions of your intestinal muscles, promoting regular bowel movements. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. 9. Avoid eating late at night: Eating a large meal close to bedtime can lead to indigestion and affect sleep quality. Try to finish eating at least 2-3 hours before going to bed. 10. Pay attention to food sensitivities and allergies: If you suspect certain foods are contributing to digestive issues, it may be helpful to keep a food diary to identify potential triggers. Speak with a healthcare professional if you believe you may have a food intolerance or allergy. In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing, and improving digestion can be achieved through various methods such as eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, managing stress, and engaging in regular exercise. By implementing these practices, you can experience better digestive health and overall well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book. The real Mark David Chapman is currently incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, he has not spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title \\"Chapter 27\\" suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, to the point of attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.  According to the British music magazine Mojo, the title was also inspired by Chapter 27 of Robert Rosen's book Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon (2000). Rosen's book explores the numerological meaning of the number 27, \\"the triple 9\\", a number of profound importance to John Lennon. Lennon was deeply interested in numerology, particularly Cheiro's Book of Numbers, along with nine and all its multiples. It was Chapman's goal, according to Rosen, to write Chapter 27 \\"in Lennon's blood\\".  Like Chapman, Schaefer is a fan of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, and said he began the script to try to understand \\"how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered me, because Lennon and Salinger have always made me feel so much better, and so much less alone.\\"","output":"This text is about the 2007 biographical drama film, Chapter 27, which portrays the events leading up to the murder of John Lennon by Mark David Chapman.

He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would zone B see less or more organisms than zone A? Answer:","output":"Zone B would see more organisms than Zone A. Justification: A \\"dead zone\\" is a term often used to describe an area in a body of water where the oxygen concentration is so low that animal life can't survive. This can be due to factors like excessive nutrient pollution from human activities (like agriculture), which leads to excessive growth of algae, and upon their death and decomposition, oxygen is used up. As such, Zone A, which is described as a dead zone, would have significantly reduced or even zero biodiversity because of the lack of oxygen.  On the other hand, Zone B, located near a national park and not declared as a dead zone, is likely to have a healthier ecosystem, more conducive to a variety of life forms. The national park's proximity might influence better conservation measures, reducing pollution levels and thereby supporting more biodiversity. Therefore, Zone B would likely see more organisms than Zone A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: Without hesitating , Hasan took his squadron into the harbour , burned it and the arsenal , plundered the Umayyad ships anchored there , and returned to Ifriqiya . Sentence 2: Hasan took his squadron into the port without hesitation , burned it and the arsenal , plundered the Umayyad ships anchored there , and returned to Ifriqiya . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"Yes, the two sentences essentially convey the same information. Both describe the same sequence of events involving a character named Hasan, who courageously undertook a certain course of action related to a harbor or port (the term varies, but the context remains the same). The activities they report are identical in both instances: Hasan unhesitatingly led his squadron into the harbor or port, set it and its arsenal on fire, looted the Umayyad ships lying at anchor there, and then made his way back to Ifriqiya. In the first sentence, the phrase \\"Without hesitating\\" functions as an adverbial phrase at the beginning of the sentence, providing context as to how Hasan undertook his actions – that is, without any pause for thought or reluctance. The rest of the sentence then follows chronologically – the destruction of the harbor and arsenal, the plundering of the ships, and the return journey to Ifriqiya. In the second version, \\"without hesitation\\" functions similarly but is placed in a different position in the sentence, making it closely associated with the verb \\"took.\\" Yet, the semantics remain the same – there is no hesitation on Hasan's part as he takes his squadron into the port, initiating his destructive and plundering actions, before finally returning to Ifriqiya.  The minor variations in phraseology and order of words don't alter the intrinsic meaning of the events being narrated, and so we can conclude that the two sentences accurately convey the same information. It's important to note that while they use somewhat different constructions and slightly different vocabulary (harbour versus port), these changes are simply stylistic and hold no significant impact on the overall message or information being conveyed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we draw the following conclusion? The Kite Runner was written by Khaled Hosseini.","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can draw the conclusion that The Kite Runner was written by Khaled Hosseini. Khaled Hosseini is indeed named as the author of The Kite Runner in the context given. He is also noted as the writer of another book, A Thousand Splendid Suns, further emphasizing his status as a renowned author. Your inference is accurate, suggesting your comprehension of the text is on point. To elaborate a bit, Khaled Hosseini is a prominent Afghan-born American novelist and physician. He garnered fame and recognition with his debut novel, 'The Kite Runner'. This book was published in 2003 and has since gained international acclaim, becoming a bestseller in the United States and many countries worldwide. The Kite Runner is a heartbreaking story of friendship, betrayal, and redemption set in Afghanistan against the backdrop of political turmoil, from the fall of the monarchy through the Taliban era. The raw display of human emotions blended with the socio-political landscape of Afghanistan gave the book its unique edge, leading to its massive success globally. This very success is what enabled Khaled Hosseini to be recognized as a highly popular author in 2008, as mentioned in the shared information. Moreover, in the statement, he is ranked the most popular fiction writer in 2008 after Stieg Larsson, which speaks volumes about his prominence in the world of literature.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): Options: - Fans of macaroni and cheese.   - Overweight or obese.   - not enough information   - University researchers. === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"Overweight or obese."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: The US has warned its coalition partners in Syria to focus exclusively on the fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) and not regime forces. Article:","output":"Title: US Coalition Partners in Syria Urged to Keep Focus on Battling Islamic State Introduction In a statement addressing the ongoing conflict in Syria, the US government has called for its coalition partners in the region to concentrate solely on the battle against the so-called Islamic State (IS), amid concerns that some partners may be directing their forces towards regime forces. The United States has been leading a coalition of nations in Syria aimed at countering the threat posed by the Islamic State terrorist organization. Nevertheless, the latest US warning highlights the increased complexity of the Syrian conflict, where multiple factions vie for control and influence. The Urgency of the Fight Against the Islamic State The US-led coalition has made significant advances in recent years, retaking vast portions of territory that had previously been under the control of the Islamic State. Despite these successes, there remains considerable work to be done in eliminating the remaining pockets of IS fighters and dismantling their infrastructure, particularly in eastern Syria. The group has also displayed a remarkable ability to adapt and regroup, which indicates the fight against the IS is far from over. It is in this context that the US has issued its warning, urging coalition partners to remain focused and dedicated to the task of defeating the Islamic State. The danger of allowing the group to regroup and regain power makes this an urgent priority for regional and international actors. Possible Diversion of Coalition Forces One of the key concerns of the US warning is that coalition partners may be diverting their forces and resources from the fight against the Islamic State towards Syrian regime forces. The conflict in Syria has drawn in multiple players with various interests, making for a convoluted web of alliances and rivalries. Some of the coalition partners have long-standing animosities with the Syrian regime, which is backed by Russia and Iran, and may be tempted to prioritize fighting against regime forces over the IS. However, jeopardizing the successful suppression of the Islamic State could have grave consequences not only in Syria, but also in terms of global security. Allowing the group to regain strength would not only enable them to continue wreaking havoc in the region, but it could also provide a platform for the planning and execution of international terrorist attacks. The Importance of Unity Among Coalition Partners In light of these challenges, the United States has emphasized the importance of maintaining unity among its coalition partners in Syria. Rather than allowing disparate interests to splinter the coalition's focus, it is crucial that partner countries remain steadfast in their commitment to the shared goal of eradicating the Islamic State. An united coalition that focuses exclusively on battling the IS can benefit from the pooling of resources, intelligence, and military expertise. This unity is essential to the ultimate goal of defeating the jihadists and ensuring that the group does not reemerge as a major threat in the future. Conclusion The warning issued by the US reflects the complicated and shifting dynamics of the Syrian conflict. As the fight against the Islamic State continues, it is crucial that coalition partners heed the US call and prioritize the defeat of the terrorist organization in order to maintain progress and ensure regional and global security. While the various factions involved in the Syrian war may have differing agendas and priorities, the need to defeat the Islamic State remains a shared and pressing responsibility for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I will then choose an appropriate ending that aligns with the context and flows smoothly from the opening sentence. Based on the given sentence, we know: 1. There are two men involved in this scene. 2. They are speaking to one another. 3. One of them walks away at some point. Using this context, let's imagine a possible story progression: Step 1: Identify the subject of their conversation. The men could be discussing a multitude of topics, such as business, a personal issue, or even a casual chat about the weather. Step 2: Describe the tone and atmosphere of their interaction. Their conversation could be tense and dramatic, lighthearted and jovial, or neutral and matter-of-fact. Step 3: Determine the reason for one man walking away. This could depend on what they were discussing and the outcome of their conversation. The man could be walking away due to frustration or disagreement, a sense of resolution, or simply because he needs to continue on with his day. Considering these steps, let's choose a subject, tone, and reason: Subject: Business Tone: Tense and dramatic Reason: Frustration and disagreement Now, let's write the ending paragraph: \\"The men fervently discussed a recent business deal, their voices rising with the tension as each one tried to impress his viewpoint upon the other. Sweat formed on their foreheads, a clear testament to the seriousness of their disagreement.

The question of Archulus's son arises in the context of rumors surrounding the authorship of this famous work. Lee and Capote, despite their lifelong friendship, encountered rumors about the authorship of To Kill a Mockingbird based on Capote's comments on the dust jacket of the first edition. His words were taken by some to suggest that he had heavily edited or even written the book himself. Further fuel was added to the controversy when Capote's biological father, Archulus Persons, was quoted by a Tuscaloosa newspaper in 2003 as stating that his son had written \\"almost all\\" of the novel. However, substantial evidence exists to debunk the claim that Capote had a significant role in the creation of To Kill a Mockingbird. For example, in 2006, a Capote letter was donated to the literary heritage museum in Monroeville, the hometown of both Lee and Capote. In this particular letter from 1959, Capote mentioned that Lee was in the process of writing a book slated for publication. This timeline supports the notion that Lee, not Capote, was the primary author. Moreover, there are numerous documented correspondences between Lee and her editor, Tay Hohoff, at Lippincott, disproving the assertion that Capote played a significant authorial role. Lee's older sister, Alice Lee, also refuted the rumor, dismissing it as \\"the biggest lie ever told.\\"  Despite the shared history and connection between Harper Lee and Truman Capote, it is clear from the available evidence that Archulus's son, Truman Capote, wasn't the true author or heavily involved in editing Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.

By James Rush and Becky Barrow PUBLISHED: 02:07 EST, 15 October 2013 | UPDATED: 03:36 EST, 16 October 2013 Move: Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts is set to leave the company to become senior vice president of Apple Burberry's chief executive announced she was quitting yesterday, reducing the number of women in charge of FTSE 100 firms to just two. Angela Ahrendts revealed she plans to leave the British firm next year to move to the technology giant Apple. Her shock departure wiped nearly £536million off Burberry’s value. Mrs Ahrendts, 53, has transformed the brand over her  tenure, and is credited with  ‘de-chavving’ its image after its famous check became popular with minor celebrities and football fans. paid chief executive of any","output":"FTSE 100 company last year, earning an impressive £16.9 million in salary, bonuses, and share options. This staggering figure not only highlights her remarkable achievements in turning Burberry into a global luxury fashion powerhouse but also raises questions about the ongoing gender pay gap and the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions within top-tier corporations. It is undoubtedly a significant loss for the British company as they attempt to navigate the highly competitive fashion industry without the guidance and visionary leadership of Mrs. Ahrendts. As she prepares to join Apple as Senior Vice President, there is much speculation about the impact her considerable experience and expertise will have on the company's future direction, particularly in relation to its expansion into the world of luxury and fashion products. With the increasing convergence of technology and fashion, Apple has been making strides in both areas and, under her leadership, the tech giant is very likely to cement its position as a major player on the global stage. At the same time, many are questioning how Burberry will fare in the post-Ahrendts era and whether they will be able to maintain their recently gained prestige and growth. In a broader context, the departure of Angela Ahrendts from the small list of female FTSE 100 CEOs prompts renewed discussion about the underrepresentation of women in the upper echelons of the business world. As one of only three female CEOs within the FTSE 100 at the time, her departure highlights the alarming gender imbalance that still plagues corporate boardrooms and raises questions about why so few women occupy these positions of power and influence. It also underscores the pressing need for organizations to address the underlying reasons for this disparity, including fostering more inclusive work cultures and implementing policies and practices that encourage and support the advancement of female talent. With Angela Ahrendts moving on to Apple, the challenge of redressing the gender imbalance within the FTSE 100 largely falls on the shoulders of the remaining female CEOs, Moya Greene of Royal Mail and Alison Cooper of Imperial Brands. It remains to be seen whether more companies will follow their lead and appoint women to top leadership positions, recognizing the valuable contributions they can make to the success of businesses in an increasingly diverse and dynamic global marketplace. In conclusion, the announcement of Angela Ahrendts leaving Burberry to take up her role at Apple has caused shockwaves both within the fashion industry and the corporate world. Her considerable accomplishments at the British company are undeniable, and her departure raises questions about what the future holds for both Burberry and Apple. More broadly, this development shines a spotlight on the ongoing gender imbalance in corporate leadership, underscoring the need for greater gender diversity in an increasingly complex and competitive global business landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Its economy has been mired in recession for years. The public is fed up with austerity. Investors want big premiums to lend to a government deep in debt, with no ability to devalue its currency.      Greece? Try Puerto Rico, the U.S. commonwealth whose long-simmering debt crisis—its 72 billion debt equals nearly 70% of its economic output, far more than any U.S. state—is about to come to a boil.      The... ||||| Violent crime is surging, schools are closing and physicians are leaving in droves – but on the mainland, there is little awareness of the island’s struggles      Viewed during a drive along the northeast region of Puerto Rico, the Caribbean landscape, usually a festival of lush greenery, is dotted with trees withering from a month-long drought. Dust blown from the Sahara in northern Africa has dulled the bright sun with a haze that shrouds everything in uncharacteristic gray.            The darkening skies mirror the bleak outlook of an island that US law calls a unincorporated territory and others call one of the world’s last colonies. Puerto Rico is floundering under 73bn in debt and a rapidly deteriorating ability to pay.      The unemployment rate is hovering at 14%. There has been a surge in violent crime. A health care crisis has seen doctors leave the island at a rate approaching 500 per year and the government is discussing an 11% cut to Medicare and Medicaid services in 2016. There has been a wave of school closures. No wonder, then, that upwards of 200,000 people have left in the last 10 years.            “What I see is a generalized feeling of stagnation,” said Universidad del Este politics professor Manuel Almeida, who struggles with how long he can afford to continue living on the island of his birth with his wife and child. “We don’t know where we’re going.”            More bad news seems to come every day to Puerto Rico, but in the US the drama is hardly acknowledged outside of the business press. This week government bonds fell to a seven-week low after David Chafey, chairman of the Puerto Rico-owned Government Development Bank, resigned for personal reasons, creating a power vacuum as concerns mount over whether the island’s electric power authority will be able to make a 1 July bond payment.            The current debt crisis is largely assumed to have resulted from years of irresponsible borrowing by the Puerto Rican government, as if it were a consumer using one credit card to pay off another. But the US government deserves a considerable share of the blame. The Jones Act that gave Puerto Ricans US citizenship in 1917 in effect made Puerto Rico a US dependent. Puerto Rico’s government cannot make trade agreements with other countries. No trading ships can dock in its ports without flying the American flag.            The island’s economy began to falter with the recessions caused by the oil crisis of the 1970s. In response, the tax code was amended and US businesses were allowed to eliminate taxes on profits made in Puerto Rico. But in 1996 a 10-year phase-out of the tax break began. Its end signaled the beginning of a 2006 recession that island economists are now calling a depression.            The government had already begun borrowing in the 1970s and unemployment grew as multinationals left the island to pursue lower wages after the implementation of North America Free Trade Agreement in the early 1990s, and a construction bubble driven by infrastructure spending in the early 2000s collapsed. The borrowing accelerated, and now the ratio of debt to Gross Domestic Product – the broadest measure of a country’s economy – is a little over 100%, making it unsustainable.            Wall Street firms have also played a part in exacerbating the crisis. Recent credit downgrades allowed Wall Street to demand hundreds of millions more in short-term lending fees, credit-default-swap termination fees, and higher interest rates. Between 2006 and 2013, Puerto Rico raised 62bn in bonds, generating 1.4bn in fees for Wall Street banks and lawyers, according to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal. The island has more municipal debt per capita than any US state.            Puerto Rico’s territorial status has helped trigger the crisis in the sense that its bonds are triple-tax exempt, the case in all municipal bonds issued by US territories. This attracted hedge funds and the more sinister vulture fund speculators that specialize in high-risk bonds for a big payoff in the end.            But since Puerto Rico, as a territory, cannot declare bankruptcy, vulture funds, which own about 24% of the debt, have taken a hard line on any attempt by the government to restructure the debt.            “As the European Central Bank began bailing out Greece and other troubled economies, the vulture funds began to move to Puerto Rico,” said Hereiberto Martínez Otero, economic adviser to two House representatives. He said that their insistence on repayment in full is dubious considering they knew the bonds were high risk when they made the investment.            A proposal by Puerto Rico’s Fundación Francisco Carvajal suggests that the Federal Reserve Act can allow the Fed to buy up many of these bonds in a way that would not be considered a bailout per se. “It would be a much-needed injection of liquidity. If they gave 85bn to AIG, why not 4bn to Puerto Rico?” said Juan Aponte, who helped author the just-published report. Still, default is imminent by the fall, University of Puerto Rico economist Argeo Quiñones Pérez insists. “This is going to wind up in federal court,” he said.            Even in the best-case scenario, debt restructuring will most likely require further painful austerity, something already carried out through the recent passage of an 11.5% sales tax, higher than any state in the union, and further cuts in government jobs. “We have already seen that these austerity policies have had a worsening effect on peripheral economies,” said Martínez.            Meanwhile, Puerto Rico’s middle-class experiment seems to be dying a slow, painful death, with depopulation and disinvestment leading to greater inequality and a vacuum for further privatization. A bustling café called Latte Que Latte in San Juan’s business district was started by local entrepreneurs who wanted to find a way to stay on the island by creating a niche business that serves artisanal coffee and pastries to millennials who, for the moment, feel compelled not to flee their homeland.            Yet one of the café workers, 57-year-old Jesús Santana, can trace his own history of circular migration, back and forth to the mainland, as a constant through generations. “I’ve been back and forth to the mainland three times already,” he said. “What’s different now is people who are leaving have no choice. People have lost their homes and cars. I feel terrible about my friends having to leave, but I want to stay, and for the moment, I still can.”       ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Puerto Rico is struggling with a 73 billion debt crisis and rapidly deteriorating ability to pay.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Carbon dioxide passes through stomata in the leaves - Water is absorbed through roots - Chloroplast cells in leaves contain chlorophyll - Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight - Energy splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen gets released into atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide used to create glucose - Glucose is food for plants.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The air is pollution free happens, how will it affect MORE sugar and oxygen being produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis here suggests that if the air is pollution-free, it may lead to more sugar and oxygen being produced through the process of photosynthesis. To evaluate this hypothesis, let's first review the steps of photosynthesis and then analyze how pollution-free air might impact those steps. As detailed in the process, photosynthesis occurs in plants mainly through the following series of steps: 1. Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through stomata, which are small openings on the leaf's surface. 2. Water is absorbed by the plant's roots and transported to the leaves. 3. Chloroplast cells in the leaves contain a pigment called chlorophyll, which allows the plant to absorb sunlight as a source of energy. 4. The energy from sunlight is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. 5. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of this process. 6. The absorbed carbon dioxide and the separated hydrogen are used to produce glucose, a form of sugar which serves as food for the plant. Now, let's consider the scenario of pollution-free air and how it could potentially impact the process of photosynthesis, thereby leading to increased production of sugar and oxygen. Air pollution typically includes particulate matter, ground-level ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and other harmful chemicals. When these pollutants are removed from the atmosphere, it can be hypothesized that there may be direct and indirect effects on the photosynthesis process. Direct Effects: 1. The primary direct effect of pollution-free air on photosynthesis is the possible increase in the availability of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an essential component for the formation of glucose during photosynthesis, and higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in a pollution-free environment could potentially accelerate the rate of photosynthesis, resulting in increased production of glucose and oxygen. 2. Improved air quality can increase sunlight penetration, as pollutants and particulate matter can scatter and absorb sunlight. In a pollution-free environment, there would be an increase in the sunlight reaching the leaf's surface, thus providing more energy for the photosynthetic process. An increase in the available energy consequently leads to an increase in sugar and oxygen production. Indirect Effects: 1. Clean air results in healthier and less stressed plants, which can enhance their growth and development. As a result, plants can focus more on the process of photosynthesis, contributing to increased sugar and oxygen production. 2. Pollution-free air can contribute to overall climate stability and reduce other detrimental environmental factors that might negatively impact plant growth. This, in turn, supports healthier plant development and can indirectly lead to increased photosynthetic rates. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation hypothesis holds merit as pollution-free air impacts both direct and indirect aspects of the photosynthesis process. The direct effects include the increased availability of carbon dioxide and better sunlight penetration, while the indirect effects involve overall healthier plants and a more favorable environment for growth. These factors collectively contribute to the increased production of sugar and oxygen through the process of photosynthesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: What is the name of the man Kitty has an affair with? Movie title: The Painted Veil Movie plot: On a brief trip back to London, earnest, bookish bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vivacious and vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts (\\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates. Kitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \\"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty. She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with a young Chinese woman in relative opulence. Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours.

Aubrey Lane, 32, claims her seatmate, whose identity has not been released, continually harassed her on an overnight flight from Phoenix to New York in June 2017, eventually following her into the lavatory and assaulting her.      Ryanair racist incident: man apologises and claims he is not racist Read more      In a new federal lawsuit, Lane and another passenger allege airline staff failed in their duty to protect her and others when they served her alleged attacker as many as six alcoholic drinks and disregarded warnings about the man’s behaviour.      “Knowing the clear dangers of intoxication and the sexual assault threats especially on red-eye flights, American Airlines offered no protection to Aubrey Lane, nor provided any of the enhanced common carrier duties,” read the complaint, which was filed in federal court in New York on Wednesday.      Sign up for the new US morning briefing      The airline has promised to “thoroughly review” Lane’s claim, having previously dismissed it as a “nuisance” and offered her 5,000.      In court papers, another passenger, referred to as 12C for her seat number, in the same row as Lane in 12A and the alleged attacker in 12B, said: “I started hearing him say how pretty she was, how lucky her husband was to have such a ‘bangin’ wife’ and how ‘what happens on vacation stays on vacation’.      “He began to move closer to her, grab her face and kiss her, which she would push him off and say that ‘couldn’t happen’. He then began to tell her he was in love with her, to which she retorted: ‘That’s impossible! You can’t fall in love with someone in one night!’ Which followed a shouting match of: ‘Yes you fucking can!’ ‘No fucking way!’, etc. This drew a lot of attention, but when I alerted the flight attendant as he walked by, he shrugged and said: ‘Well they are drinking …’ and walked away.”      According to the lawsuit, Lane had one drink.      Speaking to the Dallas Morning News in March, Lane said that several hours into the flight, she got up to use the bathroom and was followed there and raped. In the lawsuit, she claimed she was sexually assaulted.      Lane told the newspaper that after immediately reporting the alleged incident to airline staff, she was simply moved to another seat. When the plane touched down at New York’s JFK international airport, she said, her alleged assailant was allowed to leave, even as she was greeted by police and transported to a hospital nearby.      “I was feeling overwhelmed … all of a sudden, I was thrown in a middle seat, bawling. On top of being sad and hurt and scared, I was also embarrassed,” Lane said.      American Airlines is headquartered outside Dallas. In a statement, it said: “We want all of our customers to have a safe, positive travel experience with us and we are deeply troubled by any allegation of misconduct onboard our aircraft or at any of our facilities.      “If our crews discover or are told about any alleged illegal misconduct that may occur on the aircraft, law enforcement is contacted and will meet the aircraft upon arrival.”      According to FBI figures cited in the lawsuit against American, in 2014, 38 cases of in-flight sexual assault were reported in the US. In 2017, there were 63 such cases. Previous reporting has spotlighted a lack of relevant training for airline employees. ||||| No comprehensive statistics are kept on on-board sexual assaults. But a 2017 survey by the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA of nearly 2,000 members found that 1 in 5 had received a report of passenger-on-passenger sexual assault while working a flight.      Most said they had no knowledge of written guidance or training on how to handle such reports, according to the union.      Sexual misconduct aboard aircraft — whether crude verbal harassment, unwanted touching, or worse — is a problem that has persisted for years, directed toward both passengers and a predominantly female flight attendant workforce. Known instances of rape aboard aircraft are exceedingly rare, with several industry insiders and attorneys who have been closely tracking the issue for the past few years unaware of other publicly reported cases.      Scattered media reports have documented individual cases of sexual misconduct, but there’s been little in the way of coordinated action by the industry and regulators to measure or tackle the issue.      Victims of sexual abuse on planes speaking out could push the airline industry closer to a reckoning it has long avoided, experts said, as cases of sexual misconduct dominate headlines in Hollywood, Washington, D.C., New York and elsewhere in the #MeToo era.            ‘Nuisance claim’      Nine months later, Lane’s case is still in the hands of the FBI with little visible sign of progress. The agency did not return a request for comment.      Lane offered to meet with American to discuss what happened, her attorneys said. But the airline declined, in part due to the ongoing FBI investigation, according to the December letter. Lane has retained legal counsel and is planning to sue the Fort Worth-based carrier.      American described Lane’s allegations as a “nuisance claim” in a December letter that offered her 5,000 after her attorneys brought her allegation to the airline.      American spokesman Ross Feinstein declined to comment specifically on Lane’s case, citing the ongoing FBI investigation. He said the carrier regularly works with law enforcement agencies when a crime is reported on its aircraft.      “We want all of our customers to feel safe on our aircraft,” he said. “We care deeply when we hear of these types of cases ... our team offers investigative support as needed to federal, state and local law enforcement.”      In a subsequent interview with The News, American said it should have immediately followed up with Lane to assure her the incident was being taken seriously.      \\"We want to apologize that we missed the mark on assuring Ms. Lane how seriously we take her complaint,\\" Feinstein said.            He said the company has put new procedures in place in recent months that call for proactive passenger outreach from the customer relations department after reports of onboard disturbances, including sexual misconduct.            The alcohol factor      Lane was sitting in a window seat she paid 20 to select shortly before departure when her assailant — whose identity she still does not know — sat down next to her and began talking to her almost immediately.      “My first thought was this guy’s drunk. He was super chatty,” she said. “I’ve flown a lot. I’m used to people saying hello. This is the most anyone has sat down and started talking to me.”      She said she could smell the alcohol on his breath, even as he continued to be served drinks during the flight.      Her attorneys say Lane’s assailant never should have been allowed on board in his intoxicated state and shouldn’t have been served more drinks.      Feinstein, the American spokesman, said the carrier does not allow “knowingly” intoxicated passengers to board aircraft, and flight attendants have the discretion to stop serving alcohol to a passenger.      Alcohol has been a recurring theme in recent reports of sexual misconduct on planes. More broadly, it’s a factor in one-third of reported passenger disturbances on aircraft, according to 2016 figures from the International Air Transportation Association.      “American’s ultimate responsibility is the safety of their passengers,” said Lane’s attorney, James McDonough of Downs, McDonough and Cowan law firm in Durango, Colo. “Based on the actions of American Airlines’ flight crew, the safety of Aubrey was not their No. 1 priority.”      Holding airlines liable for harm suffered during a domestic flight typically means proving negligence, said Abe Bohrer, a New York attorney who specializes in flight injury cases. Bohrer is not involved in Lane’s case, but represents two victims in other onboard sexual assault cases.      “Airlines are on notice that these kinds of attacks are taking place,” Bohrer said. “The next thing you have to ask is, what are they doing to prevent them from happening in the future?”      How big is the problem?      It’s not clear how widespread the problem of in-flight sexual misconduct is on U.S. airlines that carry an average of 2.1 million passengers a day. Sara Nelson, head of the largest flight attendants union in the U.S., is worried it might be getting worse.      “It has to do with seats being closer together, more people being packed together in a tight space. You’d think that with more people, it would be more difficult. But it makes it easier for the perpetrator ... there’s less line of sight,” said Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. “There’s fewer flight attendants, all the airlines have cut back staffing. ... That has a real strain in many ways.” |||||","output":"A woman named Aubrey Lane is suing American Airlines as she claims she was raped in the bathroom on one of their flights.

Imagine having -5 apples and you get 2 more apples.  -5 apples + 2 apples = -3 apples So now our equation becomes: 0 = -3*a - 15 Step 2: Now we want to find out how many apples (a) we have. Let's move the -15 to the other side of the equal sign. To do that, we will add 15 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 15 = -3*a - 15 +15 This simplifies to: 15 = -3*a Step 3: Now, we want to find out how many apples (a) we have. To do this, we need to get rid of the -3. Since -3 is multiplied by a, we need to do the opposite, which is divide. We will divide both sides of the equation by -3: 15 / -3 = -3*a / -3 This simplifies to: -5 = a So, our answer is a = -5. That means we have -5 apples!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - bottom floor - shop - kitchen - shelf - refrigerators  I believe the correct choice is \\"shelf\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"Shelf\\" because a pantry is a designated room or area for storing food and keeping it organized, usually in a home or commercial kitchen. The primary storage solution in a pantry is typically a collection of shelves, which can be free-standing, wall-mounted, or built-in, depending on the available space and preferences of the homeowner or establishment. Now, let's analyze the other options: 1. \\"Bottom floor\\": This doesn't make much sense, as the question is specifically asking about food storage within a pantry. Food is not generally stored on the floor, and doing so could be unsanitary and inefficient.   2. \\"Shop\\": A shop refers to a retail business or store where goods are sold to customers. While food items can be found in grocery shops or supermarkets, it doesn't pertain to storage within one's pantry. 3. \\"Kitchen\\": A kitchen is the space where food is prepared and cooked. While a pantry might be located in or connected to a kitchen, the question is asking about the structure within the pantry itself that food is stored on. 4. \\"Refrigerators\\": Refrigerators are appliances used for preserving perishable food items by keeping them cool. However, not all items need to be refrigerated, and the question is specifically about where food is usually stored inside the pantry, which is a separate area from a refrigerator. In conclusion, the correct choice is \\"shelf\\" because it is a primary storage solution within a pantry and effectively organizes various food items to keep them accessible and in their appropriate storage conditions."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

After heavy cannon fire put a stop to Burmese attempts at digging up to the walls, the invaders began building a bridge at Koh Keo in order to access the walls from a new direction. Maha Chakkraphat died during the course of the siege, therefore his son Mahinthrathirat ascended the throne. Frequent Ayutthaya sorties once again prevented the Burmese from finishing the construction. Bayinnaung then sent an Ayutthayan noble he held captive under the guise of a deserter. Not only was the spy allowed into the city but he was also put into a position of power. On the night of 2 August 1569, the spy opened the gates of the city, bringing its downfall. Mahinthrathirat along with his family and the nobility were captured and taken to Pegu. Mahinthrathirat died in the same year on the way.:63 Ayutthaya became a Burmese vassal state, with Mahathammarachathirat as appointed king. The Burmese took several weeks to regroup and rest having taken Ayutthaya, which allowed Lan Xang to rally their forces and plan for prolonged guerrilla warfare.

It referred the case to the Crown Office, which has instructed the police investigation. The Edinburgh West MP has denied any wrongdoing but has withdrawn from the party whip. The BBC understands the initial police inquiries will not involve Ms Thomson, who was the party's business spokeswoman at Westminster. The investigation relates to solicitor Christopher Hales who was struck of last year for professional misconduct. He did work for Ms Thomson and it has now emerged that all 13 of the transactions he was struck off for involved her or M&F Property Solutions, a firm in which she was said to be a partner. After a hearing in May 2014, the Scottish Solicitors' Discipline Tribunal said Mr Hales failed to provide mortgage companies with key information used to prevent fraud and must have been aware that there was a possibility he was facilitating mortgage fraud, whether or not it occurred. In some cases, loans obtained for the properties were greater than the actual purchase price. Official documents from the hearing set out Ms Thomson's role in the mortgage deals. The Law Society said it first raised the case \\"informally\\" with the Crown Office in December last year but then made a formal referral in July 2015. In a statement released on Tuesday evening, Ms Thomson said she would \\"cooperate fully\\" with the police inquiry if she was required to do so.

At 18:22 the SNP issued a statement on behalf of Michelle Thomson MP. It confirmed that she would not represent the party while the police investigate property transactions carried out on her behalf. The statement reads: \\"I am aware of the police investigation and will cooperate fully if required to do so.  I have always acted within the law and look forward to being cleared of any wrong doing.  I have this afternoon decided to withdraw from the party whip whilst an investigation takes place. Once the investigation is concluded I look forward to returning to play a full role in party activities.  I will be making no further comment on this matter.\\" Yet just one minute earlier, at 18:21, a statement issued by Michelle Thomson's personal media adviser made no mention of her stepping down from SNP duties. It reads: \\"I am aware of the police investigation and will cooperate fully if asked to do so.  I have always acted within the law and look forward to being cleared of any suggestion of wrongdoing. I will be making no further comment on this matter.\\" Makes you wonder whether she really did jump or was she pushed? Either way, she is no longer the SNP's business, innovation and skills spokesperson at Westminster. Ms Thomson, a prominent figure in the pro-independence campaign group Business For Scotland ahead of last September's referendum, is reported to have built up a large \\"buy to let\\" property portfolio. She was one of 56 SNP MPs elected to Westminster in the general election in May after winning the seat of Edinburgh West and was appointed the party's spokesperson for business, innovation and skills. Opposition parties have now called for the SNP to reveal how much was known about her business dealings. A Labour spokesperson said: \\"It is now vital that the SNP come clean about this situation, and who knew what, when. \\"The first minister and senior SNP party officials have serious questions to answer. Did Nicola Sturgeon know about these allegations before Michelle Thomson was approved as a SNP candidate for the general election? \\"When did senior SNP officials first become aware of the allegations and did they investigate them? \\"Michelle Thomson was vetted by the SNP and deemed to be an acceptable candidate for an election. Senior cabinet ministers have backed her citing her business dealings. Now she is withdrawing from the party whip, and resigning from the SNP as an investigation takes place.\\" Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: â€Ž\\"Having tried to ignore these serious allegations for 48 hours, the SNP has hit the panic button. \\"The SNP needs to explain very clearly what they knew about Ms Thomson's business dealing and whether they were aware of her connection to these property deals when she was being selected. \\"The SNP promised a new politics at Westminster. It has taken a matter of weeks for their shine to wear off.\\" Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \\"It is important that any allegations that are put forward in this matter are fully and comprehensively answered by Michelle Thomson.\\" A Police Scotland spokesman said: \\"Police Scotland can confirm that as a result of a complaint from the Scottish Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal, it has been instructed by the Crown Office to carry out an initial investigation into alleged irregularities relating to property deals in the year 2010-2011.\\" Lorna Jack, chief executive of the Law Society of Scotland, said: \\"If the Law Society has concerns about any potential criminal matter arising from a SSDT finding, it will refer the matter to the appropriate authorities. \\"In the case of Christopher Hales, we first raised this informally with the Crown Office in December 2014. Our Guarantee Fund sub-committee referred it formally to the Crown Office in July 2015.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"A person named Michelle Thomson is involved in a police investigation about some property deals that happened a few years ago. She didn't do anything wrong herself, but the person who helped her with these deals, Christopher Hales, didn't follow some important rules. Now, Michelle Thomson has decided to step back from her position in her political party while the investigation takes place.

The passing of the Antarctic Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000 tonnes (35,300 short tons) in 2000.

First, we have this math problem: 692 * w - 1424 * w - 1127 * w = 59488.  Now, we need to find the value of \\"w\\" that makes this equation true.  Step 1: Combine all the \\"w\\" terms on the left side of the equation. We have three \\"w\\" terms: 692w, -1424w, and -1127w. If we add all of them together, we get: 692w - 1424w - 1127w = (692 - 1424 - 1127) * w = -1859 * w Now, our equation looks like this: -1859 * w = 59488. Step 2: Solve for \\"w.\\" To find the value of \\"w,\\" we need to get \\"w\\" by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we can divide both sides by -1859, like this: (-1859 * w) / -1859 = 59488 / -1859 This cancels out the -1859 on the left side, leaving just \\"w\\": w = -32 Now we know that the value of w that makes the equation true is -32.

Dion becomes enamored with a feisty saloon-bar singer, Belle, who works for Warren. After a stormy courtship they become lovers. Meanwhile, Bob, the youngest O'Leary son, who helps his mother, is in love with Gretchen, an innocent German girl. They meet in the barn watched by the O'Leary's cow Daisy and plan to marry. Mrs O'Leary approves of the match, but expresses disdain for the loose-living Belle. Dion and Belle bribe the local politicians to set up a saloon on the street where the tramline will pass. Dion makes a deal to support Warren's political career and carve up business in the town. However, Dion's dishonest practices lead to conflict with his brother Jack when one of Dion's cronies is arrested for multiple voting. Dion later decides to support his brother rather than Warren in the election, convinced he can cut out Warren altogether and reign-in Jack's reformist zeal. He is increasingly attracted by the daughter of the corrupt local senator, leading to conflicts with Belle. Bob and Gretchen marry and have a baby.

Set aside time during your childcare for tummy time with the babies. Tummy time encourages babies to explore what is around them.","output":"Promoting physical activity in childcare is essential for the healthy growth and development of children. Beyond providing babies with tummy time, there are several additional approaches and activities that can be implemented in a childcare setting to ensure that all children, including toddlers and preschoolers, are engaged in physical activity. 1. Develop age-appropriate physical activities: Tailor physical activities according to the age and developmental stage of the children. For instance, crawling games and gentle stretches can be introduced for babies, while toddlers can enjoy simple games like duck-duck-goose, dancing, or chasing bubbles. Preschoolers can participate in more structured activities like obstacle courses, relay races, or group games that involve running, jumping, and climbing. 2. Set a daily schedule for physical activities: Incorporate multiple short periods of physical activity throughout the day, such as morning stretches, outdoor playtime, or dance sessions. This not only helps to establish a routine but also ensures that children have consistent opportunities to engage in physical activity. 3. Create a safe and stimulating play environment: Ensure that the childcare environment is equipped with age-appropriate toys and equipment that encourage physical activity. For instance, provide soft mats for babies, climbing structures for toddlers, and balls, hula-hoops, and jump ropes for preschoolers. 4. Encourage outdoor play: Offer opportunities for children to engage in outdoor play, as it provides them with fresh air, space to run, and exposure to nature. Plan various outdoor activities, such as nature walks, gardening, or outdoor games, and ensure the outdoor space is safe and age-appropriate. 5. Incorporate movement into learning experiences: Integrate physical activity into educational and daily life activities. For example, use songs and actions to teach new concepts and encourage children to act out stories or rhymes. 6. Model enthusiasm for physical activity: Demonstrate your enjoyment of physical activity by actively participating in the games and exercises along with the children. Your enthusiasm can be contagious and inspire the children to fully engage in the activities. 7. Provide opportunities for free play: Allow children to have unstructured playtime, during which they can explore their interests and develop their physical skills at their own pace. Free play promotes creativity, problem-solving, and independence. 8. Establish partnerships with parents: Regularly communicate with parents about their child's progress in physical activities, and encourage them to continue promoting physical activity at home. Share ideas, resources, or tips to help parents incorporate physical activities into their child's daily routine. 9. Inclusive physical activity for children with special needs: Adapt activities to cater to the needs of children with disabilities or developmental delays. Work closely with specialized staff, such as occupational therapists or physiotherapists, to ensure that appropriate modifications are made to enable each child to participate fully in physical activities. 10. Monitor progress and adjust activities as needed: Continuously assess the effectiveness of your physical activity program and make necessary adjustments to better meet the needs and interests of the children. Monitor each child's progress and adapt activities accordingly to ensure that all children are actively engaged and experiencing growth in their physical development. In conclusion, promoting physical activity in childcare involves providing a safe and age-appropriate environment, offering a variety of structured and unstructured activities, establishing routines, and fostering a supportive atmosphere. By implementing these practices, childcare providers can effectively encourage physical activity and contribute to the healthy growth and development of the children in their care."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Moving is one of the most stress-producing events a family has to go through. Experts say it can be harder for children. How do you help your child adjust to the changes? The Ricardos moved from their old house to a new home. Same family, same dog-but it was harder for 9-year-old Elena. She hated the room, the house and everything. She hated leaving her friends the most. \\" I was so emotional. I mean, saying goodbye to all my friends.....my very close friends, who was my neighbor, made me so sad,\\" says Elena. For some children, the emotional stress of moving is not much more different from the emotions when someone has died. \\"There's that sense that, 'I've lost my friends, my friends, my base, my school, my teachers-everything I knew that made me feel safe is all gone now. I have to start over,\\" says Dr. Tim Jordan. Starting over is exactly Dr. Tim Jordan's advice. Make new friends, enter the new school and enter the new neighborhood. And here are some other pieces of advice. * Explain clearly to the children why the move is necessary. * Familiarize  the children as much as possible with the new area with maps, photographs or the daily newspaper. * After the move, got the children to join in activities in the place. * Help the children keep in touch with friends from the neighborhood before through telephone, letters, e-mail, and personal visits.

The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list. Q: [[-27, -19, -14, -31], [-24, 1, 4, -44, 29], [0, -4, 31, 31], [28, 43, 43, -31, -7], [2, -14, -48], [43, 12, 20, 47], [10, -39, -44, 8], [-34, -7, 6, 16]] A:","output":"My approach to solve this problem is to iterate over each sublist in the given list. For each sublist, I will then iterate over each element and if an element is odd, I will multiply it to a product variable which will initially be set to 1. If no odd number is found in the sublist, then we return 0 for that sublist. So here we go,    - For the first sublist \`[-27, -19, -14, -31]\`, there are three odd integers (-27, -19, -31). Multiplying them gives -27 * -19 * -31 = 15153.   - For the second sublist \`[-24, 1, 4, -44, 29]\`, there are two odd integers (1, 29). Multiplying them gives 1 * 29 = 29.   - For the third sublist \`[0, -4, 31, 31]\`, there are two odd integers (31, 31). Multiplying them gives 31 * 31 = 961.   - For the fourth sublist \`[28, 43, 43, -31, -7]\`, there are four odd integers (43, 43, -31, -7). Multiplying them gives 43 * 43 * -31 * -7 = 4492121.   - For the fifth sublist \`[2, -14, -48]\`, there are no odd integers. So the result for this list would be 0.   - For the sixth sublist \`[43, 12, 20, 47]\`, there are two odd integers (43, 47). Multiplying them gives 43 * 47 = 2021.   - For the seventh sublist \`[10, -39, -44, 8]\`, there is only one odd integer (-39). So, the result for this list would be -39.   - For the eighth sublist \`[-34, -7, 6, 16]\`, there is only one odd integer (-7). So, the result for this list would also be -7. Therefore, the final list that represents the multiplication of odd numbers in each sublist would be [15153, 29, 961, 4492121, 0, 2021, -39, -7]."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the last sentence in this story. By Shari Miller Time for debate: Nick Clegg is calling for a review of drugs laws after his recent visit to Columbia Nick Clegg is calling for Britain to undertake a major review of drugs laws after seeing first-hand the devastating consequences that rising cocaine demand has wrought upon Columbia. Despite robust legislation against A-class drugs, the deputy prime minister added that cocaine use has tripled in 20 years, while one in five young people have admitted to taking drugs in the last year. His calls for reformation come just a week after he visited Columbia, where he met President Juan Manuel Santos, as well as former paramilitaries, guerillas and human rights representatives. Writing in today's Observer, Clegg said: 'Many people in","output":"Britain are unaware of the destruction our drug habits have brought to countries such as Columbia, the violation of human rights, and the fueling of violent conflicts. There is a great scope for us to learn from international examples, to look at evidence-based approaches, and potentially rethink our strategies.' He presented data on the swift growth of drug use, with particular emphasis on cocaine use among young people, and how this drastically impacts impoverished communities in Columbia. Clegg's comments were met with resistance from some quarters, who argued that the reduction of drug control measures could lead to increased abuse and societal harm. However, he counter-argued that a hardline approach has not succeeded in curbing the issue, conveying that an alternative strategy, focused on rehabilitation and prevention, may be more effective in addressing the drug problem.  During his visit to Columbia, Clegg witnessed how the lucrative drug trade has instigated political instability, violence, and considerable human rights violations. He saw first-hand how the spiraling demand for cocaine fuels guerilla warfare, leading to displacement and suffering for thousands of Columbians.  Inspired by this visit, he urged for a concerted international effort to address the root causes of the drug trade, stressing the urgent need for education, economic opportunities, and a stronger criminal justice system to effectively combat the issue. Overall, this has turned into a call for a major rethink of how Britain, and potentially the world, deals with drug policy. With a focus on harm reduction, treating addiction as a health issue rather than a criminal one, and the adoption of strategies that have proved effective elsewhere, Clegg hopes for a substantial change in direction. He believes that this could finally break the destructive cycle of drug abuse and trafficking that inflicts misery on innocent people, both in consumer countries like Britain and producer countries like Columbia. Closing his opinion piece in The Observer, Clegg wrote, \\"We owe it not just to ourselves, but also to the countless individuals and communities ravaged by the drug trade worldwide, to rigorously debate this issue and strive for a more effective, compassionate approach to drug policy.\\" As the world watches and waits, it is clear that Nick Clegg's visit to Columbia and his subsequent plea for a drug law review have catalyzed an important conversation and have brought an urgent global issue into the spotlight. Now, it remains to be seen whether his call for a comprehensive and enlightened approach to drug policy will herald a transformative shift in attitude and practice, ultimately fostering a safer, more responsible world for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After leaving an underground poker game and dealing with a wealthy client's (Denis O'Hare) hit and run, Michael drives despondently and stops at a remote field, where some horses are standing on a hill. As he climbs the hill to admire them, the car explodes behind him. The story moves back to four days earlier. Michael is 75,000 in debt from a restaurant investment he entered with his brother Timmy, which collapsed when Timmy used the restaurant's funds to fuel his drug habits. Michael, having gone to a loan shark to raise the money, refuses to give up his brother and is held responsible for the debt, given one week to come up with the money. Meanwhile, one of the firm's leading attorneys, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), has a manic episode in the middle of a deposition in Milwaukee involving a class action lawsuit against U-North, an agricultural products conglomerate. Michael arrives in Milwaukee and bails Arthur, who had failed to take his medication, out of jail, but Arthur escapes from their hotel room in the middle of the night.

The decision came in light of defamatory remarks made by the star athlete, which violated the code of conduct. The committee firmly believes in promoting fair play and respectful behavior on and off the field, hence the swift action taken in this situation. Stoitchkov is known for his exceptional skills on the football field and has garnered a massive fan following during his career. Fans and fellow players alike were taken aback by the defamatory comments uttered. Despite his talent and fame, the committee had to act impartially, sending a clear message that no one is exempt from the consequences of such transgressions. Following the announcement of the ban, Stoitchkov publicly apologized for his derogatory remarks and pledged to act more responsibly in the future. While many of his fans appreciated his sincerity, others felt that the four-match ban was too lenient a punishment, given the weight of his words. Despite the public's mixed reaction, the disciplinary committee's decision remains final. It is their hope that this ban serves as a stark reminder to all players that disrespectful and offensive language is not to be tolerated in the world of sports. By upholding this principle, they aim to set a positive example and maintain the integrity of the beautiful game. As Stoitchkov serves his suspension, he will be forced to watch from the sidelines as his team competes without him. During this time, the football star is expected to reflect on his actions and dedicate himself to personal growth. His absence will undoubtedly affect the team's dynamics, but it is also a chance for others to step up and seize the opportunity to showcase their talent. All in all, the four-match ban imposed on Stoitchkov for his defamatory remarks is a significant reminder that the world of sports demands discipline, respect, and fair play.

His legal team includes Kit, who is tasked with traveling to California, and visiting Ramirez in San Quentin State Prison in an attempt to persuade him to confess.

Both sentences refer to a jockey. 2. From Sentence 1, we know that the jockey is on a racetrack and riding a brown horse. 3. Sentence 2 provides new information, stating that the jockey is leading his horse to a water trough. Based on this information, we can determine that it is not possible to tell if the second sentence is true or not, since it provides new information that doesn't contradict Sentence 1, but also isn't confirmed by it.

Question: Information:  - The nave is the central aisle of a basilica church, or the main body of a church (whether aisled or not) between its western wall and its chancel. It is the zone of a church accessible by the laity.  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - Minor basilica (in plural) is a title given to some Roman Catholic church buildings. According to canon law, no church building can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. Presently, the authorising decree is granted by the Pope through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.  - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando is a Roman Catholic diocese in Florida. It was established on June 18, 1968. Prior to that the Central Florida area was part of the Diocese of St. Augustine. Today the diocese encompasses nine counties including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Marion, Lake, Volusia, Brevard, Polk, and Sumter, a total of about . William Borders, the first Bishop of the diocese, claimed in 1969 to Pope Paul VI that the then-active 1917 Code of Canon Law placed newly explored territory under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the port of departure, making the Diocese of Orlando responsible for the moon following the flight of Apollo 11. If true, the total area of the diocese would be , making it the largest Catholic diocese in existence. In 2010, the diocese contained 81 parishes, 10 missions, and 37 schools. St. James Cathedral serves as the seat of the diocese. Within the diocese are two minor basilicas, Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine, a basilica which ministers to Catholic tourists, and St. Paul's in Daytona Beach.  - The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments is the congregation of the Roman Curia that handles most affairs relating to liturgical practices of the Latin Church as distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches and also some technical matters relating to the Sacraments. Its functions were originally exercised by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, set up in January 1588 by Pope Sixtus V.  - A pastor is usually an ordained leader of a Christian congregation. When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \\"Pr\\" (singular) or \\"Ps\\" (plural). A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation.  - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented.  - The Basilica of the National Shrine of Mary , Queen of the Universe is a Latin Rite basilica located in Orlando , Florida at 8300 Vineland Avenue . It was built to service the large number of Catholic tourists who visit the attractions in the Greater Orlando area . While it is a 2,000 seat church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando and provides Mass for the faithful , it has also become a regional tourist attraction . In 2009 , it was designated as the 63rd minor basilica in the United States . Since it is not a parish , no regular sacraments are performed , and no weekly bulletins are distributed . The Shrine consists of the main church , the Rosary Garden , the Mother & Child Outdoor Chapel , the Blessed Sacrament Chapel , the Shrine Museum , and a gift shop .  - The Latin word basilica (derived from Greek  , lit. \\"royal stoa\\", serving as the tribunal chamber of a king) has three distinct applications in modern English. The word was originally used to describe an ancient Roman public building where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. To a large extent these were the town halls of ancient Roman life. The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town, usually adjacent to the main forum. These buildings, an example of which is the Basilica Ulpia, were rectangular, and often had a central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at each of the two ends, adorned with a statue perhaps of the emperor, while the entrances were from the long sides.  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes.

You can add more ginger ale, grape juice, and ice later if desired. For now, start with the smallest suggested amounts. It is easier to add more of a flavor than it would be to subtract it. The white grape juice is a substitute for the vodka in a traditional Wallaby Darned. The ginger ale is a substitute for the champagne. Also note that you will use a greater amount of peach nectar to the drink than you would with a traditional Wallaby Darned. This is to make up for the lack of peach schnapps in this non-alcoholic version. Make sure that you use peach nectar and not peach juice. Turn the blender on, setting it to a high speed. Blend the ingredients for about 30 seconds or until the mixture becomes evenly mixed and smooth. If large chunks of ice float to the top of the mixture, turn the blender off and use a spatula or spoon to push the chunks down toward the blades. Cover the blender before turning it on again.

According to Sun Landong,a meteorologist with the Lanzhou Meteorology Observatory,visibility was less than 100 meters in Minqin, a Gansu county near Inner Mongolia,because of sand. When visibility drops to less than 1 kilometer, it is called a sandstorm. The sandstorm in Minqin blew up dust in neighboring towns, such as Baiyin,Wuwei,Jinchang and Lanzhou,the capital city of Gansu Province Dust-laden winds also swept into Beijing. Brought by northwesterly blowing at more than 20 meters per second, dust first reached the capital's suburbs at 7 a. m.,downtown areas at 9 a. m. The winds,which died down during the night,brought the temperature down to as low as 8 0C below zero and many flights put off their planned time from the city's airport. It is quite rare for sandstorms,which are frequent between March and June,to happen in winter,when the earth is frozen. The sandstorms in Gansu and Inner Mongolia do not necessarily mean there will be more of them in the spring than last year,when they were serious,but Beijing is taking it very seriously. It is reported that Beijing will spend 6 billion yuan( US 725 million) in preventing sandstorms in the capital and has already set up a special team to make sure what causes them.

[+] negative [+] positive Short movie review: thinly-conceived  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The critic is thinking negatively of the movie. When a movie is referred to as \\"thinly-conceived,\\" it typically implies that the plot or characters lack depth, substance, or originality. The use of the word \\"negative\\" in the selection options further confirms the negative perception of the movie by the critic. In this case, the movie review, despite being short, effectively communicates the critic's dissatisfaction with the movie. Key points for such negative reviews might include weak plot development, one-dimensional characters, a lack of creativity, or a story that doesn't adequately engage the audience. These are all elements that can detract significantly from an audience's viewing experience. Negative reviews can serve both as a heads-up to potential viewers looking for quality content and as constructive criticism for the filmmakers, allowing them to learn from the feedback and improve their future productions. However, it is important to remember that ultimately, a movie's worth is subjective, and one critic's opinion may not represent the entire audience. In contrast, a positive review would focus on the strengths of the movie and convey a sense of enjoyment or satisfaction. This could include references to an engaging storyline, well-developed characters, impressive cinematography, or other standout elements that contribute to creating an enjoyable cinematic experience. In summary, the short movie review with the term \\"thinly-conceived\\" reflects a negative perception of the movie by the critic, most likely due to a lack of depth in the plot or characters. This can serve as useful feedback for both potential viewers and the filmmakers themselves."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How to whistle?","output":"Whistling is a skill that takes practice and patience to master. It involves creating a small opening between your lips or teeth, and blowing air through this gap in a way that makes the desired sound. By adjusting the shape and size of the opening, you can control the pitch and tone of the whistle. Follow these steps to learn how to whistle: 1. Wet your lips: Moisten your lips with saliva or water, as this can help create a better seal and allow the air to pass more easily between them. 2. Position your tongue: Place the tip of your tongue lightly against the backside of your lower front teeth. Depending on the type of whistle you want to achieve, lay the rest of your tongue flat or slightly curled against the roof of your mouth. 3. Shape your lips: Gently purse your lips to create a small opening in the center. The shape of your lips is essential, as it will determine the airflow necessary for a successful whistle. A common mistake many beginners make is not leaving enough space for the air to pass through. 4. Blow air gently: Start by exhaling slowly and softly, gradually increasing the force of the air as necessary. Pay attention to the positioning of your lips and tongue as you blow, and be ready to adjust them to find the optimal configuration that results in a whistle. 5. Adjust the pitch and tone: To change the sound of your whistle, experiment with altering the shape and size of the lip opening, as well as the position of your tongue. A smaller lip opening and a higher tongue position will generally result in a higher pitch, whereas a larger lip opening and a lower tongue position will produce a lower pitch. 6. Practice regularly: Like any skill, whistling takes practice. It's important to be patient during the learning process and not get frustrated if you don't achieve the desired sound right away. Set aside some time each day to practice, and eventually, you'll begin to see improvements in your whistling ability. 7. Experiment with different techniques: Once you become comfortable with basic whistling, you can try out various techniques, such as whistling with your teeth or using your fingers to create a louder sound. Additionally, you can practice whistling tunes and melodies to further develop your skill. Remember that everyone's mouth and teeth structure is different, so it may take some experimentation to find the perfect lip and tongue positioning that works for you. Be patient and keep practicing, and soon you'll be able to whistle like a pro."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In reaction to the governments economic policies, Thaksin Shinawatras Thai Rak Thai Party won a landslide victory over Leekpais Democrat Party (Thailand) in the Thai general election, 2001 and took office in February 2001. Although weak export demand held the GDP growth rate to 2.2 percent in the first year of his administration, the first Thaksin Shinawatra government performed well from 2002 to 2004 with growth rates of 5.3, 7.1 and 6.3 percent respectively.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Job offer many years ago. I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence.

Several key details indicate that the writer of the review is exceptionally pleased with their experience at Higher Grounds. Here are the main points: 1. \\"The actual best kept secret in Gilbert\\": This statement indicates that the reviewer believes the place is underrated, essentially a hidden treasure in their city.   2. \\"This place is pretty hidden, but don't let that stop you\\": Although it's not conveniently located or well-known, the reviewer encourages others not to let that detract them from the enjoyable experience they could have. 3. \\"As a barista, I can confidently say that HG has the highest quality specialty coffee in this part of the valley\\": The reviewer further establishes their authority on the subject of coffee quality by stating they are a professional barista.

Passage: The screenplay was written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, and directed by Karyn Kusama. It was based on the animated TV series by Peter Chung, who had a minor role in this film version of his work. In the early stages of production, actress Michelle Rodriguez was considered for the part of Æon. She had previously worked with Kusama in Girlfight. Kusama had originally suggested filming in Brasília, the capital of Brazil, because the 20th-century modern architecture of that city fit with her vision of Bregna. The producers rejected the idea because Brasília lacked the infrastructure and technical expertise to support a major film production. After several cities were scouted, Berlin and Potsdam in Germany were chosen for filming. Berlin had several locations that fit into the organic yet structured world of Æon Flux. The crew gained permission to film in several locations that had never allowed such access before, including the Treptow Crematorium, the Adlershof Trudelturm and Windkanal wind tunnel facility, and the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (\\"House of the World's Cultures\\"). Additional locations included the Bauhaus Archive and a dissection theatre built in 1790 to train veterinarians, part of the Berlin animal shelter. It was used as the Handler space. Filming was temporarily suspended for a month during September 2004 while Theron recovered from a neck injury she sustained during stunt-work on the tenth day of shooting. She was hospitalized in Berlin for five days and required about six weeks of physiotherapy to recover.  Link Information: Berlin (, ) is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population. Its 3,748,148 (2018) inhabitants make it the second most populous city proper of the European Union after London.

Article: Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University. The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, \\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\\" \\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\\" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, \\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated   environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success.

Q: What kind of bonds are there between carbon atoms in saturated fatty acids? A:","output":"In saturated fatty acids, the carbon atoms are bonded together with single covalent bonds. These single bonds result from the sharing of two electrons between each pair of carbon atoms, thus satisfying their valence electron requirements for stable configuration.  Saturated fatty acids have all the possible hydrogen atoms bound to the carbon atoms, making them saturated with hydrogen. The presence of single bonds between the carbon atoms allows these fatty acids to have a more linear or straight structure, which leads to a higher melting point compared to unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds causing bends in their structure. In summary, saturated fatty acids have single covalent bonds between carbon atoms, making them saturated with hydrogen atoms and giving them a linear structure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called \\"a quiet moment,\\"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out.

Make sure you have a sweater in case it gets cold, a good, comfy chair, some dark chocolate (brain power!), a bottle of water, and whatever else you may need. That way, you'll have few interruptions. Research also shows that you should study in more than one place. It sounds a little funny, but your brain makes associations with your environment. So, the more associations it has, the more likely you are to retain the information. Locate all the comfy chairs and study in them all! Although it's inevitable sometimes, cramming isn't the way to go. In fact, taking breaks is good for your brain and will help you retain more. Try to study in 20-50 minute intervals, taking five or ten minutes in between. If you're on top of things, it's best to study over a full week. Several sessions will cement the knowledge in your head and by the end you'll be able to notice how much better you know the content, allowing you to relax and be confident. Easier said than done? Remember - you have all of the answers in your head already! The only challenge is getting them out! Your first instinct is nearly always correct. Don't go back and change answers. If you are really not sure, skip it and come back later.  Always read the questions given on a test. Skimming over them might tell you the opposite of what you need to do. If you're uncertain about the wording of a test question, go and ask the teacher what it means. As long as you don't flat out ask for the answer to a question, just what they meant by the question; they will usually answer. You need sleep in order to stay focused, and without it, you will have a hard time staying on task and may forget what you just learned. That's part of the reason why cramming is so evil! Sleep is wonderful. Sleep deprivation can lead to accidents, dumbs you down, and can actually cause health problems. If you have to choose between one last cramming session and sleep, choose sleep. Summary:","output":"The article discusses the importance of mnemonic devices for retaining information, the role of associations in memory, creating an ideal study environment, studying in multiple locations, avoiding cramming, taking breaks, trusting your instincts during tests, asking teachers for clarification on test questions, and the value of sleep for enhancing focus and retaining knowledge."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer: Sheet, ribbon, forked, and ball are all types of what?","output":"Sheet, ribbon, forked, and ball are all types of lightning, a natural atmospheric electrical discharge phenomenon. Lightning occurs in thunderstorms when there is a build-up of electrical energy in the atmosphere. The types of lightning mentioned can be further explained as follows: 1. Sheet lightning: Sheet lightning is a term used to describe cloud-to-cloud lightning that occurs within a cloud or between adjacent clouds. In sheet lightning, the lightning bolts are concealed within the clouds, which often results in a diffuse and bright illumination across vast expanses of the sky. This widespread illumination gives the appearance of a sheet-like layer, hence the term \\"sheet lightning.\\" As the lightning occurs within clouds, it is less dangerous than ground strikes and is considered an impressive visual phenomenon. 2. Ribbon lightning: Ribbon lightning is a type of cloud-to-ground lightning discharge that appears to split into distinct, elongated, and parallel segments. This form of lightning occurs when a strong wind blows the discharge channel sideways, causing it to be stretched into a ribbon-like appearance. As the lightning bolt moves, the course of the discharge might be influenced by the wind, forming multiple parallel \\"ribbons\\" that represent sequential return strokes. Ribbon lightning is considered an interesting phenomenon due to its unique and mesmerizing patterns. 3. Forked lightning: Forked lightning refers to cloud-to-ground or intra-cloud lightning discharges characterized by a branching or forking pattern. These types of lightning strikes have one or more channels that deviate from the main discharge path, resembling a tree or a series of veins. With multiple branches extending from the central channel, forked lightning is one of the most commonly recognized types of lightning and is often depicted in images and illustrations. 4. Ball lightning: Ball lightning is a rare and unexplained atmospheric electrical phenomenon that appears as a glowing, spherical object during thunderstorms. Ranging in size from a golf ball to several meters in diameter, ball lightning usually lasts for a few seconds and can be various colors such as yellow, orange, or blue. It has been reported to move erratically, hover, and even pass through walls and windows without causing damage. Theories on the cause of ball lightning include misperceptions of ordinary lightning, electrical discharges from the ground, and chemical reactions, but no definitive explanation has been widely accepted. In summary, sheet, ribbon, forked, and ball lightning are different types of lightning phenomena that showcase the incredible diversity of electrical discharges in the atmosphere. Each type is unique in its appearance, formation process, and visual impact, and they have intrigued researchers and weather enthusiasts for centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: A drug manufacturer would have to go to the FDA if it wanted to make a billboard for a new product, but only if that product was what? Context: The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.

Context: I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What is a way to heat a building?\\" with the following options:  - sound  - Movement of an air mass  - burning coal  - static electricity  - In the winter  - potential energy  - by indirect light  - geothermal energy Answer:","output":"One effective way to heat a building, given the facts presented, is through the use of geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is a clean, renewable source of energy that utilizes the Earth's natural heat stored beneath its surface. This heat is often in the form of hot water or steam, and can be accessed through drilling operations or harnessed through naturally occurring geothermal hot springs. To heat a building with geothermal energy, a geothermal heat pump is typically installed. This system functions by transferring heat between the building and the ground it is built on. During the heating process, the heat pump extracts warmth from the ground and increases its temperature before distributing it throughout the building. In the cooling process, the system works in reverse by transferring excess heat from the building back into the ground. Geothermal heat pumps are efficient and environmentally friendly heating and cooling systems, as they generate significantly less greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel-based heating methods such as burning coal. Additionally, geothermal heating systems require minimal maintenance and have a long lifespan, making them an attractive and sustainable solution for heating buildings. While other options listed, such as burning coal, could also provide heat for a building, it is important to consider the environmental and health implications associated with such methods. Burning coal releases harmful pollutants into the air and contributes to climate change, making it a more detrimental option for heating purposes. On the other hand, methods like sound, static electricity, and potential energy are not practical or efficient ways to heat a building. In conclusion, geothermal energy is a viable, efficient, and environmentally friendly option for heating a building, given the facts that energy is used for heating a building by a heating system, and geothermal energy is used for heating and cooling systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some describe Van Sant's film as a masterful portrayal of physical and moral degradation, using the image of Cobain to haunting and effective ends. The film's design is viewed as poignantly manipulative, stirring the viewer's emotions and thoughts in unique ways.  The movie is characterized by a somber and disoriented mood, creating an unsettling and raw depiction of drug-induced collapse. This harrowing and accurate picture of death resulting from continuous drug abuse is seen by some as a necessary departure from the more dramatized depictions of addiction in movies like 'Sid & Nancy' and 'The Doors'. However, some critics find the film stylistically frustrating. There is frequent mention of the film's slow pacing and occasional inaudibility, causing it to be a challenge for the viewer's patience. With long, single-take shots and scenes often viewing nothing more than a far wall, some deem the movie boring, while others find it gutsy and experimental. Therefore, the film is described as creeping and occasionally cryptic, yet lingering in one's mind after viewing. Its impact varied among viewers, with some finding it dull while others saw brilliance, or even both concurrently. Regardless of these mixed responses, \\"Last Days\\" is seen as a definitive and potent depiction of the process and aftermath of addiction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.  John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  Which car would emit less unburned hydrocarbons, car A or car B?","output":"Car A would emit less unburned hydrocarbons because it has a catalytic converter, which helps convert these harmful substances into less harmful emissions before they are released into the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What was the name of the first single recorded by the band that toured through the Southern United States in a van?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In January 1980, Michael Stipe met Peter Buck in Wuxtry Records, the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of 2 each per day.During April 1981, R.E.M. recorded its first single, \\"Radio Free Europe\\", at producer Mitch Easter's Drive-In... Answer:","output":"The first single recorded by the band that toured through the Southern United States in a van was \\"Radio Free Europe.\\" This band, which later became known as R.E.M., formed after Michael Stipe met Peter Buck at Wuxtry Records in Athens, Georgia, and later connected with fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry. The band spent a few months rehearsing and playing local shows before settling on the name R.E.M. As their success grew in Athens and surrounding areas, they began touring across the Southern United States in an old blue van driven by their manager, Jefferson Holt. In April 1981, R.E.M. recorded \\"Radio Free Europe\\" at producer Mitch Easter's Drive-In Studios, which marked the beginning of their journey as a groundbreaking alternative rock band."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Melt the wax using a lighter or heat source - This will allow the buried wick to become exposed.

Step 2: Monitor the melting wax - Pay close attention to the progress of the wax as it melts. This step will help avoid over-melting and ensure the wick is only exposed to the desired length.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Make sure that it has several sides and that you are familiar with the topic. Do some research to make sure that you are aware of all of the different sides on this topic, so that you can represent them in the pros and cons charts. If you're given a range of topics for a school assignment, write about something that you're passionate about.  For example, if you’re passionate about the wellbeing of marine animals, you could choose to write about the ethics of using them for product testing and experimentation. It's difficult to write a convincing letter about something you don't care about. ” This will ensure that your topic is defensible and well worded. Your topic should be clear-cut and should have strong arguments to support it. A topic like “Should cigarettes be marketed to teens?” is better worded than a topic like “Should cigarettes be marketed to teens, adults, and the elderly?” because it is more specific.  For example, the topic “murder should be legal” is not defensible, since there are no convincing arguments that support an answer of “yes.” So, a topic like: “Should the state pass legislation forbidding drivers to text while driving?” is much better. Researching is an important component of preparing to write a persuasive letter. Start your research by searching for opinion pieces about your topic online. Also look for articles about your topic by respected online and print news media.  For example, there may be valid reasons that someone would object to the state passing legislation to prohibit in-car texting. But, you’ll never be able to account for and counter these reasons if you don’t put in the research to find them out in the first place. Maybe many people feel that that legislation wouldn’t go far enough, and that the state should ban cell phones in cars altogether, no matter what they’re being used for! The tone and content of your written letter will differ based on the intended audience. So, are you writing to students and kids who are your own age? Your school principal? Adults? Political representatives and decision makers?  When dealing with an older audience, you can use a more sophisticated vocabulary. The inverse applies when dealing with a young audience.  For example, for an older audience, write something like, “A lasting political commitment to phone-free driving will ensure the survival of many who otherwise could lose their lives to a distracted driver on the phone.” On the other hand, for a younger audience, write, “Not allowing people to use phones in the car will reduce accidents. This will help keep more people alive.” Summary:","output":"The article advises choosing a specific, defensible topic for a persuasive letter, conducting thorough research to understand different sides, and adjusting tone and content based on the intended audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : I'm not really sure where to start but I guess I'll start here. My (now ex) roommate (we will call him Alan) and I met online before our first year of college and we applied to room together with 2 other people. We lived together for a year and during that time he and one of my other roommates (Harry) got in a huge fight and Alan and my last roommate (Kyle) decided to not room with Harry this year. I stayed rooming with them because we had purchased some stuff (TV, printer, etc.) together, but I mostly stayed out of the fight because it didn't involve me. Alan and I both suffered from depression and I can say at times he was one of the reasons I didn't off myself in what was a very hard year for me, and vice versa. Fast forward to this year, I'm living fairly happily. My depression, if not beaten, is manageable at least every day, and so I don't have much to say about my feelings apart from the occasional \\"I'm feeling a bit stressed about this midterm\\". So when Alan asks \\"How are you?\\" I usually answer with \\"I'm fine\\" because I am. He is still struggling, however, so I try to help him out, but, honestly, it's hard talking over the same issues over and over again when he doesn't change things ever and doesn't seem to want to. I don't think I'm supposed to be his therapist, but I also wanted to be a good friend. I kept inviting him to join me and my friends when we would go out, but he'd always be busy with plans with his friends or ditch me last minute for them. It also felt like he only ever wanted to talk about him and he rarely talked about me, except when we were in groups. He's always been that kind of person, but it started to grind on my gears because in addition to him ditching me constantly and always saying \\"I have homework\\" or \\"I'm busy\\" if I actually did have something to talk about, it started to be a little much. So I stopped inviting him to things over time and stopped really talking to him apart from greeting him in our apartment when I saw him. I'll admit I was a bit short with him at times because I was starting to resent him always having hours of time for his other friends but not a few minutes for me. I never did anything meaner than answer a question more tersely than he would have liked. At this point, I was also having big changes in school and work, so I turned my focus away from my home life to focus on that. Earlier this month, Alan moved out to another room because it was his \\"neighborhood\\", where all his friends live (roughly 10 to 15 of his friends live there). Which would have been fine, that's his perogative. My issue is that he's been saying to our mutual friends that I was a depressing roommate and that I never talked or hung out with him, and that I was never there for him which I guess was true towards the end. It feels like I'm being Harry'd for lack of a better term. So AITA for slowly pulling out of this friendship and should I apologize? Or should I confront him about what he's saying to our friends? Or should I just do nothing? Thanks in advance for any responses.","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He lives in a beautiful house with his actress wife Adelaide (Susan Fleetwood), stepdaughter Marta (Filippa FranzÃ©n), and young son, \\"Little Man\\", who is temporarily mute due to a throat operation. Alexander and Little Man plant a tree by the sea-side, when Alexander's friend Otto, a part-time postman, delivers a birthday card to him.

After Otto leaves, Adelaide and Victor, a medical doctor and a close family friend who performed Little Man's operation, arrive at the scene and offer to take Alexander and Little Man home in Victor's car. However, Alexander prefers to stay behind and talk to his son. In his monologue, Alexander first recounts how he and Adelaide found this lovely house near the sea by accident, and how they fell in love with the house and surroundings, but then enters a bitter tirade against the state of modern man. As Tarkovsky wrote, Alexander is weary of \\"the pressures of change, the discord in his family, and his instinctive sense of the threat posed by the relentless march of technology\\"; in fact, he has \\"grown to hate the emptiness of human speech\\".[2] The family, as well as Victor and Otto, gather at Alexander's house for the celebration.

(Published Monday, Jan. 5, 2015)      One of New Jersey's \\"Real Housewives\\" has gone to the big house.      Teresa Giudice surrendered at the Federal Correction Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, at about 3 a.m. Monday to begin serving a 15-month sentence for bankruptcy fraud, her attorney said.      Giudice's last meal before turning herself in was at a 24-hour diner near the facility, according to attorney James Leonard, who drove the \\"Real Housewives of New Jersey\\" star from her home in northern New Jersey to the prison.      \\"The last thing she said was, basically, 'Tell everybody I'll be fine,'\\" Leonard said. \\"She was very positive, very upbeat, in great spirits.\\"      Famous Mug Shots: Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman      The Bergen Record photographed a black SUV bringing Giudice to the prison.      Giudice and her husband, Giuseppe \\"Joe\\" Giudice, pleaded guilty last year to hiding assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitting phony loan applications to get some 5 million in mortgages and construction loans. Joe Giudice also pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes totaling more than 200,000.      Under terms of their plea agreements, Joe Giudice will start serving his 41-month sentence when Teresa Giudice is released, an arrangement aimed at ensuring the couple's four daughters will have one parent at home at all times.      \\"Teresa's only concern is and has been that of her four children,\\" Leonard said in an email earlier Monday. \\"I know that she was anxious to get in and get this entire nightmare behind her so that she can return home to her family.\\"      Leonard said that under federal sentencing rules, Teresa Giudice could be eligible to be released by next December, and also could spend the last month or so of her sentence at a halfway house or under some form of home monitoring.      The Giudices also are required to pay 414,000 in restitution under their plea agreement; Teresa Giudice sent the government a check for 200,000 in early October, according to court records.      At the Giudices' sentencing in October, U.S. District Judge Esther Salas criticized the couple for not disclosing all their assets as required under their plea agreement, calling it \\"the same pattern of obstruction, concealment and manipulation as they showed in the bankruptcy case.\\"      Still, Salas sentenced Teresa Giudice to a sentence below the range sought by the U.S. attorney's office and staggered her sentence with her husband's so they wouldn't be in prison at the same time and unable to care for their four daughters.      Joe Giudice is not an American citizen, and he faces an immigration hearing when he completes his sentence and is expected to be deported to Italy. His attorney has said Giudice came to the U.S. as an infant and didn't know he wasn't an American citizen until he was an adult.      Joe Giudice also pleaded guilty in state court in October to unlawful use of identification in a case involving a bogus driver's license. His 18-month sentence will run concurrent with his federal sentence.      Last month, Teresa Giudice sued former attorney James Kridel, whose firm handled the couple's bankruptcy case, alleging legal malpractice and negligence.      Reached by phone last week, Kridel called the lawsuit \\"ridiculous\\" and denied the claims.      \\"We did what we were supposed to do,\\" he said. \\"We can only rely on the facts that were provided to us. I don't wish her any ill will, but I would have preferred a 'thank you' rather than a lawsuit.\\"      Copyright Associated Press / NBC New York ||||| Advertisement      Today, Teresa will begin her 15-month sentence in federal prison for 41 counts of fraud.      But the Real Housewives of New Jersey star mustered her courage on Sunday as she attended mass with her family at the Sacred Hearth Church in New Jersey.      Advertisement      \\"Teresa can't believe this day is finally here,” an insider told Radar. “She's beyond distraught. But she's going to spend every last second with her beautiful daughters before she goes away.\\"      Teresa and husband and husband Joe were first suspected in 2009 when they filed for bankruptcy and then quickly withdrew just before an auction of their furniture was to take place.      In 2013, the couple was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud and bank fraud.      The couple was also accused of falsifying their loan applications, as well as bankruptcy paperwork.      Originally, the reality stars planned to plead not guilty, but eventually admitted guilt on the 41 charges against them.      Teresa has managed to enjoy the Despite the turmoil,has managed to enjoy the holiday season with her family , and even make some quick cash.      The RHONJ diva was spotted spending time with her daughters and looking for last-minute publicity opportunities in the weeks leading up to her sentence.

Find the corresponding Czech translations for each word. 3. Arrange the Czech words in a grammatically correct order. Step 1: Identifying the words in the phrase and their parts of speech - \\"Hey\\" is an interjection used to get someone's attention or to express enthusiasm. - \\"we're\\" is a contraction of \\"we are,\\" indicating the first person plural pronoun \\"we\\" and the verb \\"to be\\" in present tense. - \\"cool\\" in this context is an adjective describing a positive quality, meaning relaxed or in control. Step 2: Finding the corresponding Czech translations for each word - \\"Hey\\" can be translated to \\"Ahoj\\" (informal) or \\"Hej\\" (more informal) in Czech. - \\"we're\\" can be translated to \\"jsme\\" in Czech. - \\"cool\\" in the given context can be translated to \\"v pohodě\\" in Czech. Step 3: Arranging the Czech words in a grammatically correct order - The interjection \\"Ahoj\\" or \\"Hej\\" can be placed at the beginning of the sentence. - The verb \\"jsme\\" comes next. - The adjective \\"v pohodě\\" comes last. Putting it all together, the translated phrase in Czech is: \\"Ahoj, jsme v pohodě\\" or \\"Hej, jsme v pohodě\\".
