Question: \\"what was the last punishment mentioned?\\"  Context: \\"In August 2007, an increase in the price of diesel and petrol led to Saffron Revolution led by Buddhist monks that were dealt with harshly by the government. The government cracked down on them on 26 September 2007. The crackdown was harsh, with reports of barricades at the Shwedagon Pagoda and monks killed. There were also rumours of disagreement within the Burmese armed forces, but none was confirmed. The military crackdown against unarmed protesters was widely condemned as part of the International reactions to the Saffron Revolution and led to an increase in economic sanctions against the Burmese Government.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The last punishment mentioned in the given context is the increase in economic sanctions against the Burmese Government, which was a consequence of their harsh crackdown on unarmed protesters during the Saffron Revolution in 2007. This international response was a way to condemn the government's actions and to pressurize them to halt their violent tactics against the Buddhist monks and other peaceful demonstrators. The economic sanctions aimed to limit the government's resources and financial support, thereby weakening their capacity to continue oppressing the civilian population. Such measures were imposed by various countries and international organizations, and included restrictions on trade, aid, investments, and diplomatic relations, all of which contributed to further isolating the Burmese Government on the global stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the US it stayed on the charts longer than any other Led Zeppelin album and became the biggest selling album in the US not to top the charts (peaking at #2). \\"Ultimately,\\" writes Lewis, \\"the fourth Zeppelin album would be the most durable seller in their catalogue and the most impressive critical and commercial success of their career\\". At one point, it was ranked as one of the top five best-selling albums of all time.  Led Zeppelin IV received overwhelming praise from critics. In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, Lenny Kaye called it the band's \\"most consistently good\\" album yet and praised the diversity of the songs: \\"out of eight cuts, there isn't one that steps on another's toes, that tries to do too much all at once.\\" Billboard magazine called it a \\"powerhouse album\\" that has the commercial potential of the band's previous three albums.  Robert Christgau originally gave Led Zeppelin IV a lukewarm review in The Village Voice, but later called the album a \\"genre masterpiece\\", and wrote that it showed the band at the pinnacle of their songwriting. Even though he found their Medieval ideas limiting as usual, he said that it is \\"the definitive Led Zeppelin and hence heavy metal album\\". In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine credited the album for \\"defining not only Led Zeppelin but the sound and style of '70s hard rock\\", while \\"encompassing heavy metal, folk, pure rock & roll, and blues\\". In his album guide to heavy metal, Spin magazine's Joe Gross cited Led Zeppelin IV as a \\"monolithic cornerstone\\". BBC Music's Daryl Easlea said that the album made the band a global success and effectively combined their third album's folk ideas with their second album's hard rock style, while Katherine Flynn and Julian Ring of Consequence of Sound felt it featured their debut's blues rock, along with the other styles from their second and third albums.

Please answer the following question: Greg is an electrical engineer. He works for an engineering firm that builds houses. Yesterday, Greg was checking two of the houses. He noticed that one of the houses had short circuit. He labeled that as case A. But the other house didn't have short circuit. He labeled that as case B.  In which case the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other, case A or case B?  Hint: In the wiring of a building, the wires carrying the current in and out are different and never touch directly. The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires. Answer:","output":"In case A, the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other. This is because a short circuit is present in this case, which occurs when the wires carrying the current in and out come into direct contact with each other or the ground wire. This contact bypasses the resistance offered by appliances or other resistors in the circuit, allowing a large amount of current to flow through the wires, often leading to dangerous and unsafe conditions. In case A, the presence of a short circuit indicates that this direct contact between the incoming and outgoing current wires has occurred."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Samantha Lewthwaite: 'the white widow' linked to Nairobi attack Photo of fake South African passport of Samantha Lewthwaite, nicknamed the 'white widow' released by Kenyan police in December 2011 Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images Witnesses to the Kenyan shopping centre massacre have said a woman who spoke English was one of the attackers. The developments come as British counter-terrorism officials try to establish if Britons were involved in the attack, and whether or not Samantha Lewthwaite, already wanted for terror offences in Kenya, commanded the killers. Lewthwaite is the widow of Jermaine Lindsay, one of the 7/7 suicide bombers. On Monday, Kenyan officials said all the attackers were men. Hours later the foreign minister said a British woman who had repeatedly been involved in terrorist activity was among the attackers. Her associate and fellow Briton, Germaine Grant, is due to go on trial on Tuesday in Kenya for terrorism offences, with Scotland Yard officers expected to testify against him. A Kenyan newspaper, The Star, said survivors recalled a woman giving orders as the attackers stormed the shopping centre. It said two employees of the Radio Africa Group told the newspaper that \\"a woman appeared to be giving orders.\\" They added: \\"One said her face was covered but she had a woman's arms and body. She was not carrying a gun but had a large bag around her waist.\\" The witnesses said she gave instructions in English which would be translated into Swahili as the attackers took hold of the shopping centre. The paper quoted a witness as saying: \\"The woman was not armed but as soon as she issued orders, the men would go on a killing rampage.\\" Another witness said: \\"It was definitely a woman because we could tell it from the voice.\\" The paper said security officials who have viewed CCTV footage of the attack agree there is a light skinned or even Caucasian person among the attackers. But some officials believe it is a woman with a pony tail while others believe that is being confused for a bandana. The British home secretary, Theresa May, supported the UK official line by saying next to nothing about claims that Britons were a part of the terror attack. On a visit to Pakistan, May said: \\"I'm aware of the reports that there has been a British woman involved. \\"At this time until we've seen the investigation completed, it's not possible to comment further. As I indicated earlier, I'm not able to give further details.\\" It also emerged that the grandmother of Lewthwaite, originally from Banbridge, Northern Ireland, had been admitted to hospital due to stress, it was claimed. Elizabeth Allen, from Banbridge, Co Down, was given a panic alarm by police to contact if her granddaughter made contact. Joan Baird, a veteran Ulster Unionist councillor in Banbridge who knows the family, said: \\"This is so distressing for everyone. Mrs Allen is 85 and she is in and out of hospital. It is just so distressing. \\"Certainly, everybody in the town is shocked and distressed by the news.\\" On Monday, Kenya's foreign minister said a British woman who has allegedly taken part in terrorist activity \\"many times before\\" was among the attackers . Amina Mohamed said the militant acted alongside \\"two or three\\" Americans during the atrocity in Nairobi which has left at least 62 people dead, including six Britons. Lewthwaite is known to be in east Africa and is wanted by Kenyan police over alleged links to a terror cell that planned a coastal bombing campaign. In March last year, officials said she had fled to Somalia and that officers were hunting a woman who used several identities. The Kenyan authorities had claimed all the militants involved in the three-day mall siege were men, but Mohamed appeared to contradict this in a US television interview on Monday. \\"From the information that we have, two or three Americans [were involved] and I think so far I have heard of one Brit ... a woman ... and I think she has done this many times before,\\" she told the PBS NewsHour programme. Mohamed said the Americans were 18 to 19 years old, of Somali or Arab origin and lived \\"in Minnesota and one other place\\" in the US. US officials said they were looking into whether any Americans were involved. State department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it had \\"no definitive evidence of the nationalities or the identities\\" of the attackers. White House spokesman Ben Rhodes said US officials have seen \\"reports coming out of al-Shabaab that indicate information along those lines\\", referring to possible involvement of Americans in the attack. \\"But we have to run those to ground, of course,\\" he said. \\"We do monitor very carefully and have for some time been concerned about efforts by al-Shabaab to recruit Americans or US persons to come to Somalia. \\"This is an issue that has been tracked very closely by the US government, and it's one that we'll be looking into in the days ahead.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Samantha Lewthwaite, also known as the 'White Widow,' has been linked to the Nairobi shopping mall attack in Kenya, where witnesses claim a woman was giving orders in English during the massacre.

(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg dominated the final, vital qualifying session of the 2014 F1 season in Abu Dhabi, putting the German in the box seat for the World Championship title.  The Mercedes driver, who has endured a fine but torrid season alongside his rival Lewis Hamilton, led the session from the start as Hamilton put in an error strewn performance to finish second, 0.386 seconds behind Rosberg, and set up a mouthwatering race in the Middle East on Sunday.  Neck and neck  Rosberg and Hamilton have clashed on and off the track during a season dominated by Mercedes. The two drivers have gone neck and neck for most of the season before a late spurt of form from Hamilton put him ahead for the last race.  But a controversial rule change that awards double points for the last race of the season means that Hamilton's 17 point championship lead is far more precarious than it should have been.  \\"It's only one step, a very small step,\\" Rosberg said after securing his 11th pole of the season. His performance meant that Mercedes managed to secure every single pole this season, a feat that hasn't been seen by an engine manufacturer since Ford achieved the same in 1969.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Q: jump around right thrice after walk around right A:","output":"To solve the task, we will break down the command into individual actions. 1. Identify the main parts of the command: \\"jump around right thrice\\" and \\"walk around right\\" 2. Determine the sequence of actions for each part:    a. \\"jump around right thrice\\" -> JUMP_AROUND_RIGHT_THRICE -> (I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT) x 3    b. \\"walk around right\\" -> WALK_AROUND_RIGHT -> (I_WALK, I_TURN_RIGHT) 3. Since the command says \\"jump around right thrice after walk around right\\", we need to execute the walk part first and then the jump part. Putting it all together, the correct sequence of actions to execute the command is: I_WALK, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT"},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given books product reviews in Japanese language.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? The girl wanted makeup for the occasion that night and chose the mascara over the lipstick since the  OPT:  -mascara was convenient to get.  -lipstick was convenient to get.","output":"The girl wanted makeup for the occasion that night and chose the mascara over the lipstick since the mascara was convenient to get. To elaborate on this decision, let's consider the factors that might have led the girl to prioritize convenience when selecting makeup for the event. When getting ready for a social gathering, people often face time constraints and may have a predetermined amount of time in which they need to complete their preparations. In this situation, it seems that the girl was focused on efficiency and practicality in her makeup choices, ultimately deciding to go with the mascara because it was easier to acquire than the lipstick. One possible reason for this convenience could be related to accessibility. Perhaps the girl had already purchased or owned a mascara that she liked and felt would be suitable for the event. On the other hand, maybe she did not have a lipstick that matched her preferred color or style for the occasion. In this case, the girl may have thought that finding an appropriate lipstick would be too time-consuming or complicated, especially if she needed to visit multiple stores or consult with others before making a decision. Another factor that might have influenced the convenience of the mascara could be application time and simplicity. Mascara can typically be applied more quickly than lipstick, especially if the wearer has steady hands and is experienced with the process. Lipstick, on the other hand, may require precision, lip liner, or even blotting to ensure a clean and polished look. By opting to wear mascara, the girl would be able to save some time and also minimize any potential mishaps that could arise from hurriedly applying lipstick. Additionally, mascara tends to be a more versatile makeup product when compared to lipstick. A well-applied mascara can enhance the eyes, making them appear more prominent and expressive, which could help the girl feel more confident and poised during the occasion. Lipstick, though it can be a striking accessory, might not create the same visual impact, particularly if the chosen shade did not complement her overall appearance. As such, the girl may have felt that mascara was a more universally flattering option. In summary, the girl chose mascara over lipstick for the occasion that night primarily because it was more convenient to get. This convenience could have stemmed from factors such as her existing makeup collection, ease of application, the versatility of the product, and the impact that each makeup choice would have had on her appearance. By selecting mascara, the girl ensured that her preparations for the event would be efficient, practical, and ultimately result in her looking and feeling her best."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: There are many differences between America and China. The biggest difference is traffic rules. In America there are too much more cars than in China. But there are much fewer traffic jams and accidents in America than in China. We hardly see traffic police in the street, but all cars obey strictly traffic rules, and people hardly find that a car does not obey traffic rules in the street. About American traffic rules, there are many better terms, such as: 1. Stop line: There are stop lines in all crossing without traffic light (some have two stop lines and others have four stop lines). All cars must stop while meeting the stop line. 2. Traffic light: There is traffic light in the crossing of the road. Cars may almost turn every direction. The traffic light can give signal step by step including u-turn. There is a kind of middle lane of turning left. When a car wants to turn left in the road, he may enter into the middle lane of turning left and give a signal of turning left. When he thinks being safe, he may turn left. In many conditions the order of passing is also given very specifically. If people want to change lane or turn, they must look behind and think being safe. Only so, they may do it. 3. Specific item: Such as parking, there are three kinds of lines (their colors are white, blue or red) in the roadside. Every line may park different kinds of cars. There are many streets in some residential areas  , and there is a kind of rule that any car cannot park at any time or any period time. In every parking, there are some special positions for invalid   people. 4. About the priority of passenger and car: At any case, passengers have the priority to cars. And only after passengers have passed the road and got the top of sidestep, cars may go ahead. In general, traffic rules of America are very specific, convenient, safe and humanizing. Question: Why is there a middle lane of turning left on the road? Answer: A:","output":"The middle lane of turning left on the road serves several important purposes that contribute to the efficient, safe, and orderly flow of traffic. These include: 1. Separating conflicting traffic movements: The left-turn lane separates turning vehicles from through traffic, reducing the chances of rear-end collisions and improving overall traffic flow. When a motorist wants to make a left turn, they can move into the left-turn lane without obstructing the vehicles traveling straight ahead. 2. Providing a safe waiting area: The middle lane of turning left provides a safe area for vehicles to wait for a suitable gap in oncoming traffic to complete their turn. This prevents vehicles from stopping in the through lane, leading to a safer environment for all road users. 3. Facilitating smoother traffic flow: By allowing vehicles to turn left from a dedicated lane, traffic continues to flow smoothly in the other lanes meant for vehicles going straight or turning right. This minimizes disruptions to the overall flow of traffic and reduces congestion. 4. Enhancing visibility: The left-turn lane enhances visibility for drivers turning left, as they have an unobstructed view of the opposing traffic. This allows drivers to make better judgments about when it is safe to proceed with their turn, thus reducing the likelihood of accidents. 5. Streamlining signal timings: In intersections with traffic lights, having a designated left-turn lane helps regulate signal timings more efficiently. This means that left-turning vehicles can be given a specific time to turn, while other vehicles proceed in their respective directions. This not only improves traffic flow but also reduces congestion and associated risks. In conclusion, the middle lane of turning left on the road plays a crucial role in maintaining safe, efficient, and organized traffic conditions. It separates conflicting traffic movements, provides a secure waiting area, improves traffic flow, enhances visibility, and streamlines signal timings – all essential aspects contributing to road safety and better traffic management."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Many students report being adversely affected by the smell of formaldehyde during a dissection.","output":"How to cope when you feel sick during a dissection: 1. Avoid the smell: As mentioned, formaldehyde is used to preserve specimens, and its smell can be quite strong and nauseating for some students. To minimize exposure to this smell, try standing back from the specimen when you are not actively dissecting. If possible, ask your instructor if you can open a window or use a small fan to help dissipate the smell. 2. Be prepared: Before the dissection begins, make sure you are well-rested, well-hydrated, and have had a nutritious meal. This will help to stabilize your blood sugar levels and make you less likely to feel nauseous during the dissection. 3. Take deep breaths: If you begin to feel queasy during the dissection, try taking slow, deep breaths. This can help reduce nausea, regulate your heart rate, and even decrease the intensity of unpleasant smells. You can also take a break from the dissection and step outside or into the hallway for some fresh air. 4. Stay calm: It is important to remain as calm as possible during a dissection, even if you are feeling nauseous. Focus on your breathing and remind yourself that the feelings of nausea will eventually pass. You can also try talking to your classmates or instructor to distract yourself from the discomfort. 5. Use personal protective equipment (PPE): Wearing gloves, a lab coat, and even a mask can help to create a barrier between you and the smells associated with dissection. If you have access to a mask that contains a filter, this can be particularly helpful in minimizing the effects of odors. 6. Work with a partner: If you find it difficult to handle the specimen yourself, ask a classmate if you can work together. This will help to lessen the emotional impact of the dissection and can provide additional support if you find yourself feeling unwell. 7. Communicate with your instructor: If you are finding it particularly challenging to cope with the dissection, talk to your instructor about your concerns. They may be able to offer additional accommodations, such as letting you step out for regular breaks or providing alternative methods for learning the material. 8. Gradual exposure: If you have never dissected before, it is helpful to gradually expose yourself to the sight and smell of specimens. This can be done by observing dissections before participating in them or even looking at images and videos of the process. Becoming familiar with the dissection procedure can help to reduce anxiety and desensitize you to any potential triggers. 9. Consider alternative learning methods: If you find that you simply cannot handle dissections, discuss alternative learning methods with your instructor. You may be able to use virtual dissection software or other resources to learn the same material without the need for a hands-on dissection. 10. Seek support: Lastly, know that it is not uncommon for students to feel sick or uneasy during dissections.

Are Koi and goldfish related? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Task: Find the differences between koi and goldfish, determine if they are related, and identify if these questions are paraphrases of each other. Step 1: Analyze the questions First, I'll need to understand what the questions are asking. The first question wants to know the differences between koi and goldfish, while the second question wants information on whether the two are related or not. The third question specifically asks if the first and second questions are actually capturing the same meaning, or paraphrases of each other. Step 2: Research the differences between koi and goldfish To provide an accurate answer, I'll need to research the differences between koi and goldfish. After researching, I found that koi and goldfish are indeed different. Some key differences include: 1. Origin: Koi fish originated in East Asia, particularly Japan and China, while goldfish were domesticated in China. 2. Size: Koi fish tend to be larger (can grow up to 3 feet in length) than goldfish (averagely grow up to 6-7 inches in length). 3. Color patterns: Koi fish have individual and unique patterns and colors, while goldfish have fewer color variations (commonly orange, yellow, white, and black). 4. Price: Koi fish are generally more expensive than goldfish, due to their unique colorings and breeding lineage. 5. Lifespan: Koi fish have a longer lifespan (25-35 years on average, and potentially up to 100 years) compared to goldfish (10-15 years on average). Step 3: Research if koi and goldfish are related Next, I'll need to research if koi and goldfish are related. After researching, I found that koi and goldfish are indeed related. Both koi and goldfish belong to the Cyprinidae family and share common carp ancestors. Consequently, they share certain physical and behavioral similarities. Step 4: Determine if the two questions are paraphrases of each other With the answers to the first two questions in hand, I can now address the third question. The first question concerns the differences between koi and goldfish, and the second question asks if they are related. Although both questions are somewhat connected, they are not paraphrases of each other; they ask for distinct information about the relationship and differences between the two fish. Summary: The main differences between koi and goldfish include their origins, size, color patterns, price, and lifespan. They are related, as both koi and goldfish belong to the Cyprinidae family and share common carp ancestors. However, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they ask for different information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Team sports are such sports as baseball,basketball and volleyball. Team sports need two separate  teams. The teams play against each other. They compete  against each other in order to get the best score. For example, in a football game, if Team A gets 7 points and Team B gets 3 points,Team A wins the game. Team sports are sometimes called competitive  sports. Besides team sports, there is another main type of sporting activity. It's individual sports. In individual sports there are no teams. People play individual sports such as swimming, skiing and running. Of course, it is possible  to compete in individual sports. It is possible to keep a score in individual sports. The main difference, however, between team sports and individual sports is that team sports always require  more than one person. Question: _   is an example of individual sports. Yes or no, is the answer \\"The high jumping\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"high jumping\\" is an example of individual sports. Individual sports are those where athletes participate and compete on their own, without being part of a team. As mentioned in the article, swimming, skiing, and running are also examples of individual sports. High jumping, like these other individual sports, allows athletes to compete against themselves and others, striving for personal records and achievements. While it is possible to keep a score in individual sports, the primary focus is often on self-improvement and personal goals, rather than competing against another team as in team sports.

But I decided to give them another shot because I'm in London. And my friend Mallery invited me. And because dinner parties in London are very different from those back in New York. There, 'I'm having a dinner party' means: 'I'm booking a table for 12 at a restaurant you can't afford and we'll be sharing the checque evenly, no matter what you eat.' Worse, in Manhattan there is always someone who leaves before the bill arrives. They'll throw down cash, half of what they owe, and then people like me, who don't drink, end up paying even more. But if I try to use the same trick, the hostess will shout: \\"Where are you going?\\" And it's not like I can say I have somewhere to go: everyone knows I have nowhere to go.

The last time I went to one, the guests were from France, India, Denmark and Nigeria; it was like a gathering at the United Nations in New York. The mix is less striking. It's like a gathering at Bloomingdale's, a well-known department store. For New Yorkers, talking about other parts of the world means Brooklyn and Queens in New York.

However, there are a couple of things that leave me wanting for more. So here's my 3-star review, detailing how the app could be better. 1. User Interface: I'll give the app credit for providing a comprehensive summary of my call, text, and data usage. However, the user interface is a bit outdated, which makes it not as visually appealing or easy to navigate compared to other modern apps. Adding some refinements to the design and presentation would greatly improve app experience. 2. Customization: The level of customization in the app is quite limited. While it allows me to set up plans and billing cycles, there's not much else that can be tailored to my needs. Adding the option to choose custom thresholds and notifications for my usage could make the app more user-friendly. 3. Accuracy: I have encountered some discrepancies in my usage stats, particularly with the data usage tracking. Sometimes, it feels like the app isn't accurately reflecting my actual data consumption. Addressing this issue would make users more confident in relying on the app for usage monitoring. 4. Features: While the app lists basic call, text, and data usage, it would be great to see more advanced features such as app-based usage breakdown, or usage forecasting based on historical trends. These additions could help users better understand and manage their phone usage patterns. In conclusion, the de.ub0r.android.callmeter app gets the job done for the most part, but it could be considerably enhanced with some much-needed updates and improvements. For now, it's a solid 3-star app with potential to be more.

Summarize this article: Many employers offer the opportunity to automatically put aside some of your income in a 401(K) plan and match your contributions.  Take advantage of this option to reduce the inconvenience of having to manually make deposits each month.  The method by which you set up automatic contributions will vary depending on your employer.  Talk to your employer’s accounting department to learn more about automatic payments at your workplace. The amount of money you decide to contribute automatically with each pay period is up to you.  The more you  put away each month, the more you’ll have to work with when you retire. In addition to employer-provided plans, put some of your income into other investment or savings accounts like an IRA.  Other retirement plans you might want to invest in include Roth IRAs, rollover IRAs, and Spousal IRAs.  Each type of account has different maximum contribution limits and different levels of taxation for withdrawals and earnings.  Since these contribution limits and taxation levels change frequently and depend on your age, consult a financial advisor for the most current information about the specific individual retirement account you’re interested in. You should be able to make automatic contributions to these individual retirement plans, too.  Talk to your employer’s accounting department for more information. Investing in stocks is a great way to make money.  Talk to a certified broker or financial adviser to get started.  Contact the stockbroker in your area who charges the lowest service fees.  Alternately, use a stock investment app to invest on your own.  Stock brokers usually require an initial investment that ranges from 1,000 to 5,000 USD (or more). You can start investing in stocks through some apps with as little as 5 USD.  Other apps will require larger initial investments.  Some of the most trustworthy stock market investment apps are Stash, Acorns, Betterment, and Wealthfront. Steadily add money to your stock portfolio to grow it over time. Robo-advisors (online services that use algorithms to manage your stocks, mutual funds, or ETF investments) tend to charge less than actively managed funds.  Even if you choose to go with an actively managed fund, choose one that charges the lowest possible investment fees. All stock investment entails some risk, but some investments are riskier than others.  For instance, if you invest in emerging foreign markets or initial public offerings (which are untested and possibly prone to volatility), you could lose your money.  On the other hand, riskier investments tend to have bigger payoffs if they succeed and their price rises.  For a safer investment approach, diversify your investments by choosing a mix of different industries (like tech, automobiles, and construction) and put most of your money in long-term mutual funds and ETFs. There’s no right or wrong way to balance your investment risk levels if you want to retire by 40.  Either a high-risk investment approach or a low-risk investment approach could work. Ethical investing means putting your money into companies whose beliefs align with yours.  For instance, if you’re a vegetarian, you might not want to invest in a fund that includes meat or fish companies. Ask your broker or financial advisor for a full list of the companies you’re invested in.  If you’ve invested through a robo-advisors, the list of companies you’re invested in should be available online. Summary:","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of saving and investing for retirement, starting with taking advantage of employer-sponsored 401(K) plans and making automatic contributions to ease the process. It also suggests looking into other retirement account options like IRAs, Roth IRAs, rollover IRAs, and Spousal IRAs, while recommending consultation with a financial advisor for the most current information on contribution limits and tax levels.

Robo-advisors can help manage your stocks, mutual funds, or ETF investments more affordably than actively managed funds. It is crucial to consider the level of risk associated with different investments and adopt a diversified approach by investing in various industries or focusing on long-term mutual funds and ETFs.

Here is an article: MONTREAL — The golden hour on this late September afternoon was anything but. The air was hot and hazy, the sky the color of the industrial concrete buildings doubling as the set of the F.B.I. Academy. Then Priyanka Chopra sauntered out of her trailer, a vision in mirrored shades and towering gold stilettos. And suddenly, as if by divine intervention, setting sunbeams pierced through the clouds. “The sun opened up, right?” she said with a squeal and a kick. “I said” — she crooked a finger toward the sky — “ ‘Come to me.’ ” That the sun should oblige this Bollywood actress might not seem unreasonable to her fans in India, where she is one of that nation’s highest-profile celebrities. But in North America, she remains a virtual unknown outside South Asian communities. Now Ms. Chopra, 33, is banking on television to help her crack Hollywood. “After being in movies for 13 years in India, I’m suddenly a debutante all over again,” she said. “I’m scared and nervous — petrified, actually.” In ABC’s new drama “Quantico,” which debuts Sept. 27, Ms. Chopra plays Alex Parrish, a half-Indian, half-white F.B.I. trainee suspected of masterminding the biggest attack on New York since Sept. 11. The series, which has been described as “Homeland” meets “Grey’s Anatomy” (with a bit of “How to Get Away With Murder,” because of its many flashbacks), places Ms. Chopra front and center in an ethnically varied cast. It’s part of ABC’s continued drive to promote diversity on-screen through casting and outreach efforts. In 2012 Ms. Chopra and her manager, Anjula Acharia-Bath, met Keli Lee, the executive vice president for talent and casting for ABC Entertainment Group, at a dinner party. As Ms. Lee named some of the actors she’d helped place through the company’s diversity efforts — Sofia Vergara in “Modern Family,” Sandra Oh in “Grey’s Anatomy” and Kerry Washington in “Scandal” — Ms. Acharia-Bath remarked, “Well, you haven’t done a South Asian yet, and we’re one-fifth of the population.” Afterward, she sent Ms. Lee some of Ms. Chopra’s movies, and the next thing she knew, a deal was in the making. “I flew to India to convince Priyanka to work at ABC,” Ms. Lee wrote in an email. “I wasn’t going to let distance be a barrier to making a deal.” The one-year commitment required ABC either to develop a project for Ms. Chopra or cast her in an existing project. She ultimately read 26 scripts; “Quantico” was her favorite. Her audition for the role was her first — ever — and Joshua Safran, the show’s creator, wasn’t sure what character Ms. Chopra intended to read for when she arrived wearing a designer dress and carrying a designer handbag. “She walked in the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have,” he recalled. “I was very confused because I didn’t know who she was, but we all sat up straighter.” (“Ah, I love that, when it happens at hello,” she said, giggling at the anecdote. “I make sure my walk is a good entrance. My heels and my hair.”) Mr. Safran had imagined a protagonist hardened by tragedy and aloof. He hadn’t quite envisioned Alex as a bombshell. “One of the things we talked about was, ‘Is she so glamorous that she can’t play this regular person?’ ” said Mark Gordon, one of the show’s executive producers. “What we quickly came to realize is that she’s a huge star internationally, but she’s actually quite regular. She’s very accessible both to women and to men, and that’s especially important at ABC, where a large percentage of the audience is women.” Off-screen Ms. Chopra is somehow unthreatening despite an entourage of assistants and stylists. (There are 22 people on “Team P.C.”: 11 in Mumbai, where she owns a home and is a ubiquitous presence on the city’s billboards, and 11 in North America, where a recent pool party at her rental house here gave rise to a spontaneous Bollywoodesque water ballet to Major Lazer’s “Lean On.”) The child of an Indian Army doctor and a gynecologist, Ms. Chopra moved with her parents every two years until 12, when she decided to live with an aunt in the United States, bouncing among Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Queens; and Newton, Mass. A dutiful daughter, she planned to become an engineer. Returning to Bareilly, India, the end of her junior year, she was studying for her university boards when her mother, pleased by Ms. Chopra’s swanlike transformation, sent photos to the Miss India pageant. She won that title and six months later, at 17, was crowned Miss World 2000 — after which her mother wailed, “Who’s going to study now?” In 2002, Ms. Chopra entered the realm of Bollywood, a term she dislikes for its dismissiveness. “Hindi movies are an amalgamation of culture, of emotions, of drama, of music, of dance — which is why Hindi movies are an experience,” she said. “We make about a thousand movies a year and are expanding into markets in Japan and Germany and Russia. We premiere our movies at the Berlinale and Cannes. It’s an amazing time.” Ms. Chopra has made nearly 50 movies, winning a National Film Award (the Indian equivalent of an Oscar) for her portrayal of a small-town girl turned supermodel in “Fashion” and lesser prizes for her turn as a 19-year-old autistic woman in “Barfi!” That role, for which she had to prove to the director that she could believably subvert her innate allure, is among those of which she’s proudest. “The most challenging thing in India is for her to come out of her glamour zone,” said Irrfan Khan, an occasional co-star and the Indian actor with perhaps the most familiarity in America, in films like “The Amazing Spider-Man” and “Jurassic World.” “Hindi commercial cinema tries to incorporate a beautiful girl in the same roles over and over, but if you’re smart enough you learn to expose your personality. She understands her persona and keeps experimenting in different genres.” Asked where home is these days, Ms. Chopra replied, “On a plane,” noting she’d spent Labor Day weekend filming in India and would briefly return in October. “I just want to go where my work takes me.” But for the moment, she’s hoping it’s in the United States. “I simply want the opportunity to show people what I bring with me. They might like it, they might hate it. I don’t know. I just hope that people are inquisitive.” A version of this article appears in print on September 20, 2015, on page AR20 of the New York edition with the headline: A Big Bollywood Star on the Small Screen.

Question: What are the main characteristics of the style of church that took 16 years to build? Passage 1:On 15 February 2016, McCartney announced two initial festival dates in Europe for the upcoming summer. These two headlining performances at Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands and Rock Werchter in Werchter, Belgium were revealed before the initial revelation of the \\"One on One\\" tour. These tours would feature mostly similar elements of the \\"One on One\\" performances yet with a condensed set list to allot for festival curfew limits and less stage elements given restrictions. In the wake of the passing of notable Beatles and McCartney producer George Martin, McCartney announced the initial \\"One on One\\" dates for North America and Europe. In North America, McCartney's visit to Fresno, California would mark his first performance in the city, and his performances in North Little Rock and Sioux Falls would be his first performances in the states of Arkansas and South Dakota respectively. Elsewhere in North America, McCartney would perform in Portland after an eleven-year absence following his 2005 'US' tour. The two shows in Vancouver would follow his previous performance in the city at the BC Place stadium in 2012, yet this tour would feature two shows in the neighboring Rogers Arena after the pyrotechnics during his concert at BC Place accidentally damaged the stadium's new roof. McCartney's Seattle show would mark his shortest absence from any North American city on the tour announced currently, as he performed at the city's Safeco Field during the inaugural year of the 'Out There' tour. McCartney announced a performance on 16 March in Minneapolis at the Target Center. This show would take place on 4 May 2016, less than two years after McCartney's last performance in the city at the adjacent baseball stadium sharing a corporate sponsor with the arena, Target Field. Due to high demand of tickets a second show in Minneapolis was announced the next day and would take place on 5 May.  Passage 2:In 1689 the Gothic edifice was demolished as it proved too small for the growing cult of Saint John Cantius, the patron saint of the Jagiellonian University who's laid to rest there. In 1689-1705 the new Baroque church was erected, modelled on Sant'Andrea della Valle in Rome. The architect was a Polonized Dutchman Tylman van Gameren, a chief architect at the court of John III Sobieski. The interior stucco decoration is the work of Baldassarre Fontana, and the polychromy assisted by painters and brothers Carlo and Innocente Monti and Karl Dankwart of Nysa. The painting of St. Anne in the high altar is the work of Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter, court painter of King John III Sobieski. The 18th-century paintings in the stalls showing the life of Saint Anne are by Szymon Czechowicz. In the transept there is an altar of the adoration of the cross to the left, and the tomb of John Cantius to the right.  Passage 3:Romik Khachatryan began to get involved in football at age 7. Khachatryan began his youth career in SKA-Arai Echmiadzin. The then 16-year-old player played for the club for 11 games and was able to score 2 goals in the 1994 season. The club performed poorly that season, taking 14th place in the Armenian Premier League and was sent to the Armenian First League. Khachatryan joined Kilikia Yerevan. The club, who were soon merged with Pyunik Yerevan, played in season informal and formal, respectively. Following 1996, he joined BKMA Yerevan and stayed at the club for a long time. His first season for the club was initially not good. They had 7 defeats at the start of the Premier League. In the first round, the team finished with one win and 10 losses. Moreover, after the first match of the second round, the club withdrew from the championship and disbanded. Khachatryan himself played only three games and returned to Pyunik. From this period, Khachatryan went to take his career elsewhere. Successful performance for the club provided the opportunity to play in the Armenia national team. At the end of the 1998 Armenian Premier League, he made a transition into Araks Ararat. His skills developed in the new club and he was allowed half of the season to move to the Cypriot First Division. He played for Cypriot clubs Olympiakos Nicosia, APOEL Nicosia and Anorthosis Famagusta. He also returned to Armenia to play for Banants Yerevan, which made it to the finals of the 2008 Armenian Cup.

It was built between 1705 and 1722 as a reward of the British government to John Churchill, 1stDuke of Marlborough, for defeating King Louis XIV's army at Blenheim, a small Bavarian village on the Danube River. The palace was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh, which displayed strength and arm glory. It is the largest non-royal building in England and is now listed by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Winston Churchill In 1874, the palace was the birthplace of the duke's most famous _ . Winston Churchill, who was to become the UK's Prime Minister (some would say Britain's greatest 20th-century politician ) and Nobel prize winner for literature. It is also in Blenheim that Winston got married to Clementine Hozier in 1908. A lasting exhibition is devoted to the man's life, work and writings. Winston and his wife are buried in Bladon Church within the palace. Opening Hours & Admission Blenheim is still the home of the 11th Duke of Marlborough and is therefore not open all year round (although the park is).

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   16 Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance Charles Darwin1 , for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits arise. As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be DNA2 , or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a million matches out of sequence. However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order differently than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of a mutation. These changes in DNA sequences are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest difference in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the example of Sickle cell anemia3 is commonly given as its origin is a difference of only one base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells. Individual sequences of DNA that encode for specific proteins are called genes and are the units of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide4 , and together all of the genes (and some sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions) together make up the entire chromosome5.

The following points elaborate on the sentiment: 1. The music is described as a variety, which might indicate the reviewer found the selection of songs diverse and appealing. This aspect of the review, on its own, suggests a neutral to positive sentiment about the music. 2. However, the tone of the review takes a negative turn when mentioning the drinks. By stating that the drinks are \\"mostly juice,\\" the reviewer implies that the bar's choice of non-alcoholic beverages is either limited or not to their preference. 3. The reviewer expresses distinct displeasure with the quality of the cranberry and vodka drinks. In describing them as \\"watered down\\" and containing \\"little vodka,\\" the sentiment conveyed is one of dissatisfaction and disappointment with the beverage quality and value for money. 4. Adding to the frustration, the reviewer mentions an issue with the staff clearing their table with \\"beer still in the bottles.\\" This experience is likely to be seen as a waste of money and a lack of attentiveness from the staff, contributing more negativity to the overall sentiment. 5. Finally, the reviewer's use of the term \\"jacked\\" in relation to their drinks being taken away suggests a sense of invasion and annoyance. This adds an emotional weight to their negative experience, emphasizing their discontent. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review can be characterized as mainly negative, as the reviewer's criticisms and expressions of dissatisfaction outweigh the neutral to positive comment about the music. The primary sources of dissatisfaction stem from the quality of the drinks, perceived value for money, and unresponsive staff behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are the following two questions the same? \\"Should I use 'a' or 'an' with the word 'unicorn'?\\" Is this a common phrase: “try my hand at something”?","output":"No, the two questions you posed are not the same. They address different aspects of the English language. Let us examine both questions and provide detailed explanations for each one. 1. \\"Should I use 'a' or 'an' with the word 'unicorn'?\\" This question pertains to the use of indefinite articles in the English language, specifically when to use 'a' or 'an' before a noun. In English, the indefinite articles 'a' and 'an' are used to refer to a non-specific item or element. The choice between 'a' and 'an' depends on whether the noun that follows it starts with a vowel or consonant sound. Using 'a' or 'an' depends on the pronunciation of the first letter of the next word, rather than its spelling. Generally, 'a' is used before words beginning with a consonant sound, while 'an' is used before words beginning with a vowel sound. In the case of the word 'unicorn,' even though the first letter is 'u' which is a vowel, the pronunciation starts with the consonant sound /j/ (as in 'you'). Therefore, you should use 'a' before the word 'unicorn.' The correct usage is \\"a unicorn.\\" 2. Is this a common phrase: “try my hand at something”? Yes, the phrase \\"try my hand at something\\" is a common phrase in the English language. It is an idiom that means to attempt to do something, especially when trying it for the first time or when lacking experience in that particular activity. The phrase implies that you want to test your skills or abilities in a specific area to see how well you perform or how much you enjoy it. For instance, if someone wants to learn how to paint, they might say, \\"I want to try my hand at painting.\\" This implies that the person may have little or no prior experience or expertise in painting and wants to give it a shot to find out if they can do it or enjoy it. In conclusion, your two questions address different aspects of the English language. The first question deals with the appropriate use of indefinite articles ('a' or 'an') before a noun (\\"unicorn\\" in this case). The second question inquires about the commonality of a specific phrase or idiom (\\"try my hand at something\\") and its meaning. Both questions and their respective answers contribute to a deeper understanding of language usage and expressions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is best gifts for a best friend for birthday to a boy?","output":"While the two questions seem similar at first glance, they are not exactly the same. They both revolve around selecting an ideal gift for a boy, but they differ in the context and specific factors considered in their respective scenarios. Let's look at each question more closely. 1. What is the best gift for a boy? This question is a general inquiry, attempting to determine the best gift for a boy without any specific context. The answer to this question can vary greatly because it depends on numerous factors such as age, interests, cultural background, and individual preferences. For example, a suitable gift for a 6-year-old boy could be a toy, while a teenager might be more interested in a video game or sports equipment. Therefore, the answer to this question is subject to a wide range of possibilities, and there is no definitive answer that encompasses all boys. 2. What is best gifts for a best friend for birthday to a boy? This question has a slightly more specific context. It is aimed at finding the best gift for a boy who is considered a best friend and the gift is meant to be given on his birthday. This added context narrows down the focus slightly and factors in the personal relationship between the giver and the receiver of the gift. Here, the best present might be something that reflects the bond between friends and has sentimental value. Moreover, since it is a birthday gift, there could also be an expectation to select something more special and unique. The answer to this question will still depend on the age, interests, and preferences of the boy in question, but it also takes into consideration the emotional weight of the gift and its relevance to their friendship. For example, a personalized gift that commemorates the friendship - like a photo album or a customized item - might be more fitting in this context as compared to a generic toy or gadget. In conclusion, while both questions revolve around finding a suitable gift for a boy, they are not precisely the same. The first question is a broader inquiry with a potentially wider range of responses based on a variety of factors. The second question provides a more specific context and focuses on a gift for a best friend, emphasizing the importance of the relationship between the giver and receiver and the occasion of the birthday. Consequently, the second question calls for more personalized and emotionally significant gifts when compared to the first one."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Carolina tells him she is on the run from Frank, who she believes wants to kill her because she gave evidence of mob activity to the FBI. Humpty lets her stay on the condition that she save money to return to college and better her life. Ginny gets her a waitressing job where she works. Ginny used to be an actress and was happily married, but her infidelity caused her husband to divorce her. She and Humpty are raising her young son Ritchie, a troubled boy who habitually gets into trouble by setting fires. She is unhappy with Humpty and life on the boardwalk, and has been carrying on an affair with Mickey for a few months. Humpty is an angry and loud recovering alcoholic who runs the carousel and goes fishing with his friends to bring home dinner. He finds joy and patience for life with Carolina around, and he pays for her to attend night school. Mickey is attracted to Ginny's maturity and experience, and views her as a damsel in need of saving. He and Carolina accidentally meet some time later, and he becomes attracted by Carolina's story. He thinks he is in love with her, but is conflicted about his feelings for Ginny. Ginny steals money from Humpty to buy Mickey an expensive watch as a birthday present, which he refuses to accept. By this time, Ginny has become suspicious of Mickey's feelings for Carolina and is jealous.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Q: You are given a target race, and two sentences. Your task is to determine whether the second sentence is either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them. Target: Hispanic  All of my boyfriend's family is Hispanic. They're always fighting and causing drama. A:","output":"To complete this task, you need to analyze the second sentence and compare it with the first sentence and the target race to determine if it's a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated. Here's how to do it in simple steps: 1. Read the first sentence: \\"All of my boyfriend's family is Hispanic.\\"    This sentence provides the context and the target race, which is Hispanic. 2. Read the second sentence: \\"They're always fighting and causing drama.\\"    This sentence contains a statement about the behavior of the boyfriend's family. 3. Determine whether the second sentence is a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated with respect to the target race.    - Stereotype: If the second sentence presents an oversimplified and generalized idea about Hispanic people, like a common belief that this group shares specific negative behaviors, then it is a stereotype.    - Anti-stereotype: If the second sentence challenges or contradicts a common stereotype about Hispanic people, then it is an anti-stereotype.    - Unrelated: If the second sentence has no connection or relevance to the target race (Hispanic), then it is unrelated. 4. Compare the second sentence (\\"They're always fighting and causing drama.\\") with the target race (Hispanic).    - The sentence negatively portrays the boyfriend's family, suggesting that they frequently fight and create drama. This can be considered a stereotype if it implies that these behaviors are typical for all Hispanic people based on an oversimplified notion. After following these steps, we can conclude that the answer is: A: Stereotype."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have the equation: 66*u - 74*u = 40 First, we need to combine the \\"u\\" terms. So, we will subtract 74*u from 66*u: (66 - 74) * u = 40  This gives us: -8 * u = 40 Now, we want to solve for \\"u\\". To do this, we need to get \\"u\\" by itself. To get rid of the -8, we'll do the opposite operation, which is dividing.

I fear she would be very disappointed looking at the world today. A lot of people don't smile and when it comes to service today, they're just not nice. Now don't give me wrong, not all service workers but a good many. I was on the phone the other day with a computer help desk. First a man, then later a woman, who couldn't have been ruder. And this to a customer, who didn't know his way around a PC. But no matter, I could tell they thought I was a bother, The woman, in fact, seemed to be chewing gum as she unemotionally clicked off a series of commands for me to perform. The next day I heard from a friend of mine who got a performance review without his boss once looking up at him. Not once. You see it everywhere. Gone are the days when people cared about you. It's a sign of the time, I suspect. But that makes me sad -- for them and for us all. People who aren't happy, who don't smile, who don't kid, who don't joke or make light of even bad situations, make for an even worse situation. And it spreads like a cancer. Someone's rude to you, you're rude to them and to the next fellow you meet, and on and on. Smiles are contagious but so annoyances. The boss who can't be bothered with his workers. The celebrity who can't be bothered with her annoying fans. You know, my mom used to judge presidential candidates by how they smiled. I would say, \\"But mom, you don't know if that smile is real.\\" \\"Oh, yes I do,\\" she would tell me. \\"I can feel it.\\" It's in their eyes, she would say. And it's in their smile.

The poem , written in some 7,400 dactylic hexameters , is divided into six untitled books , and explores Epicurean physics through richly poetic language and metaphors . Lucretius presents the principles of atomism ; the nature of the mind and soul ; explanations of sensation and thought ; the development of the world and its phenomena ; and explains a variety of celestial and terrestrial phenomena . The universe described in the poem operates according to these physical principles , guided by fortuna , \`\` chance , '' and not the divine intervention of the traditional Roman deities .  - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.  - Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded around 307 BC. Epicurus was an atomic materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Following Aristippusabout whom very little is knownEpicurus believed that what he called \\"pleasure\\" was the greatest good, but that the way to attain such pleasure was to live modestly, to gain knowledge of the workings of the world, and to limit one's desires. This would lead one to attain a state of tranquility (\\"ataraxia\\") and freedom from fear as well as an absence of bodily pain (\\"aponia\\"). The combination of these two states constitutes happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism insofar as it declares pleasure to be its sole intrinsic goal, the concept that the absence of pain and fear constitutes the greatest pleasure, and its advocacy of a simple life, make it very different from \\"hedonism\\" as it is colloquially understood.  - Titus Lucretius Carus (15 October 99 BC  c. 55 BC) was a Roman poet and philosopher. His only known work is the epic philosophical poem \\"De rerum natura\\" about the tenets and philosophy of Epicureanism, and which is usually translated into English as \\"On the Nature of Things\\". Lucretius has been credited with originating the concept of the three-age system which was formalised from 1834 by C. J. Thomsen.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

Review: \\"Kings and Queen\\" is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose. The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie. The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live. The other story involves a young man named Ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship. With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, \\"Kings and Queen\\" might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships. It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching. But, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on. Even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over. For instance, Nora's father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours. Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father. Nora could be accused of being confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place? I don't think so. Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom. But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here. This is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.

Summarize: The woman, named locally as Cindy Waldron, 46, from Lithgow in New South Wales, was reportedly swimming with a friend on Sunday evening at Thornton Beach near Cairns in north Queensland. She was in waist-deep water when she was attacked, media reports said. The last fatal attack in the area occurred in 2009, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. \\"We would hold grave fears for the welfare of the woman,\\" police spokesman Russell Parker said. \\"Her 47-year-old friend tried to grab her and drag her to safety and she just wasn't able to do that. \\"[The friend] then ran to a nearby business and raised the alarm, and from that point police and other authorities were advised. \\"They had been walking along the beach and they've decided to go for a swim just in waist-deep water at Thornton Beach and probably a very nice, clear night, but obviously may not have been aware of the dangers.\\" Nine News reported that witnesses heard the woman yell: \\"A croc's got me, a croc's got me.\\" Neil Noble, of the Queensland state ambulance service, said a 5m (16ft) crocodile had been reported recently in the area. A search for the missing woman, helped by a rescue helicopter, resumed on Monday. A local cafe is being used as a command post by the search team. The woman's friend is being treated for grazes and shock. 'An avoidable tragedy' Residents told Australian media that the area was a known crocodile habitat. And local MP Warren Entsch said the area was popular with crocodile-spotting tours and there were many warning signs. \\"This is a tragedy but it was avoidable,\\" he told reporters. \\"If you go in swimming at 10 o'clock at night, you're going to get consumed.\\" Crocodiles are common in Australia's tropical north and kill an average of two people each year, according to AFP news agency. Summary:","output":"A woman named Cindy Waldron was swimming with her friend at a beach in Australia. It was nighttime and the water was not very deep. Sadly, a big crocodile came and took Cindy away. Her friend tried to help, but couldn't save her. People are now searching for Cindy, but they are very worried about her. The place where they were swimming is known to have crocodiles and there are warning signs, so it was not a good idea to swim there at night."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Memento is a 2000 American neo-noir psychological thriller film directed and written by Christopher Nolan, and produced by Suzanne and Jennifer Todd. The film's script was based on a pitch by Jonathan Nolan, who later wrote the story \\"Memento Mori\\" from the concept. It stars Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Jonathan Nolan pitched the script","output":"Yes, the next sentence follows, given the preceding text. The connection is established through the information provided about the film Memento and its script. As mentioned, Memento was directed and written by Christopher Nolan, and was based on a pitch by Jonathan Nolan. Therefore, it is appropriate to say that Jonathan Nolan pitched the script. To elaborate further, Memento is a unique and innovative film in terms of both storytelling structure and narrative devices. The plot revolves around Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce), a man suffering from anterograde amnesia, causing him to create an unconventional system of remembering crucial information in order to solve the murder of his wife. This is achieved through the use of tattoos and Polaroid photographs, which he annotates with key points of his investigation. One of the defining features of Memento is its nonlinear narrative, which is presented in reverse order. The story alternates between color sequences that are shown in reverse chronological order and black-and-white scenes that are depicted in chronological order. This deliberate disarrangement results in a unique viewing experience, as the audience tries to piece together the events that unfolded and make sense of the protagonist's quest for truth and vengeance. Jonathan Nolan's pitch for the film's script is particularly noteworthy because it introduced the film's groundbreaking narrative structure. When Christopher Nolan became interested in his brother's idea, they worked together to further develop the story that would eventually become Memento. The script received high praise for its originality and innovative take on storytelling, which not only kept viewers engaged but also challenged their understanding of memory, identity, and truth. In addition to the aforementioned critical acclaim, Memento garnered various awards and nominations. The film received two Academy Award nominations, one for Best Original Screenplay for Christopher Nolan and another for Best Film Editing for Dody Dorn. It also won numerous independent film awards and solidified Christopher Nolan as an innovative and influential filmmaker in the industry. In conclusion, given the preceding text and the information within it, it is accurate to say that Jonathan Nolan pitched the script for Memento. His initial pitch laid the foundation for the film's innovative narrative structure and storytelling techniques, which ultimately proved to be instrumental in the film's success and impact on the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Animals are an English rhythm and blues and rock band, formed in Newcastle upon Tyne in the early 1960s. The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic No. 1 hit single, \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", as well as by hits such as \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\", \\"It's My Life\\", \\"I'm Crying\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\". The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-orientated album material. A group with Burdon, Jenkins, and new sidemen John Weider (guitar/violin/bass), Vic Briggs (guitar/piano), and Danny McCulloch (bass) were formed under the name Eric Burdon and Animals (or sometimes Eric Burdon and the New Animals) in December 1966 and changed direction. The hard driving blues was transformed into Burdon's version of psychedelia as the former heavy drinking Geordie (who later said he could never get used to Newcastle \\"where the rain comes at you sideways\\") relocated to California and became a spokesman for the Love Generation.  Early performances of this group did not include any of the Animals hits for which the original Animals had become known. Some of this group's hits included \\"San Franciscan Nights\\", \\"Monterey\\" (a tribute to the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival), and \\"Sky Pilot\\". Their sound was much heavier than the original group. Burdon screamed more and louder on live versions of \\"Paint It Black\\" and \\"Hey Gyp\\". In 1968, they had a more experimental sound on songs like \\"We Love You Lil\\" and the 19-minute record \\"New York 1963 - America 1968\\". The songs had a style of being silent at the beginning and then becoming psychedelic and raw straight to the end with screaming, strange lyrics and \\"scrubbing\\" instruments.  There were further changes to this lineup: Zoot Money was added in April 1968, initially as organist/pianist only, but upon McCulloch's departure he also took on bass and occasional lead vocals. In July 1968, Andy Summers replaced Briggs. Both Money and Summers were formerly of British psychedelic outfit Dantalian's Chariot, and much of this new lineup's set was composed of Dantalian's Chariot songs which caught Burdon's interest. Due to Money's multi-instrumental load, in live settings bass was played alternately by Weider and Summers. Summers was to eventually go on to great success as the guitarist for The Police.  By December 1968, these Animals had dissolved, and both their double album Love Is and the singles \\"Ring of Fire\\" and \\"River Deep - Mountain High\\" were internationally released. Numerous reasons have been cited for the breakup, the most famous being an aborted Japanese tour. The tour had been scheduled for September 1968 but was delayed until November, due to difficulty obtaining visas. Only a few dates into the tour, the promoters - who, unbeknownst to the band, were yakuza - kidnapped the band's manager and threatened him at gunpoint to write an IOU for 25,000 to cover losses incurred by the tour's delay. The manager wrote out the IOU but, correctly surmising that none of his captors could read English, added a note that it was written under duress. The yakuza released him but warned that he and the band would have to leave Japan the next day or be killed. The Animals promptly fled the country, leaving all their tour equipment behind. Money and Summers both subsequently pursued solo careers (though this pursuit was swiftly aborted in Summers' case), Weider signed up with Family, and Burdon joined forces with a Latin group from Long Beach, California, called War.

Here is a goal: To adhere a plastic stabilizer to fabric, Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"When it comes to adhering a plastic stabilizer to fabric, there are a few different approaches that you can take to ensure a strong and long-lasting bond. The most suitable method will vary depending on factors such as the type of plastic and fabric you are working with, the desired level of flexibility for the finished product, and any specific concerns about weight or appearance. To help you choose the right approach, here is an overview of four possible methods to adhere a plastic stabilizer to fabric, along with some key considerations for each: 1. Sewing: This is perhaps the most traditional approach, and it can be particularly effective if the plastic stabilizer is positioned between two layers of fabric. By sewing around the edges of the plastic, you can create a durable bond without adding excessive weight or bulk to the finished product. Consider the following when sewing:    - Choose a needle that is appropriate for both the plastic and the fabric: look for a needle that can easily penetrate the plastic without damaging it and that is also designed for use with your chosen fabric.    - Use a durable thread that will stand up to wear and tear, such as nylon or polyester.    - Take care not to sew the plastic too tightly to the fabric, as this can cause wrinkles or distortion. 2. Gluing: There are various adhesives available that are specifically designed for use on both plastics and fabrics. These can create a strong bond without the need for sewing, but may not be ideal for situations where a high degree of flexibility is required. When using glue, keep the following tips in mind:    - Select an adhesive that is compatible with both your plastic and fabric materials.    - Follow any specific instructions provided by the adhesive manufacturer, which may include information about surface preparation, application techniques, and drying times.    - Apply glue evenly and avoid excessive amounts, as this can lead to unsightly bulges or distortions. 3. Heat pressing: Some plastic stabilizers and fabric types can be bonded using a heat press, which applies heat and pressure to create a secure bond. This method can produce a professional finish while also allowing for flexibility in the final product. When heat pressing, bear these points in mind:    - Choose a heat press that can accommodate your materials and reach the correct temperature and pressure for bonding. Consult the manufacturer's specifications if necessary.    - Test your fabric and stabilizer combination on a small scale before committing to a larger project.    - Pay close attention to temperature, pressure, and time settings to ensure a successful bond without damaging either material. 4. Velcro or hook and loop fasteners: This method might be more suitable for temporary or adjustable attachments between the plastic stabilizer and fabric. These fasteners allow for easy removal and reattachment as needed. Consider these tips when using Velcro or hook and loop fasteners:    - Choose a strongly adhesive-backed Velcro or fastener that will stick to both the plastic and fabric surfaces.    - Cut your fasteners to the appropriate size to fit on the stabilizer and fabric without any overhang.    - Don't forget to match up the \\"hook\\" and \\"loop\\" sides correctly when applying them to the stabilizer and fabric. In summary, choosing the best method for adhering a plastic stabilizer to fabric will depend on the specific materials you are working with and the desired characteristics of the finished product. By carefully considering the advantages and limitations of each approach and experimenting with small-scale tests if needed, you can identify the most effective way to accomplish your goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even after  Bin Laden's departure from the area, CIA officers hoped he might return, seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up. The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and  Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former  Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance. Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarke's phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted. CIA officers, including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt, were irate.\\" Mike\\" thought the dismantling of the camp erased a possible site for targeting  Bin Laden. The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem. From 1999 through early 2001, the United States, and President Clinton personally, pressed the UAE, one of the Taliban's only travel and financial outlets to the outside world, to break off its ties and enforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan. These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over  Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however. Bin Zayid later told an American diplomat that the UAE valued its relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to \\"Iranian dangers\\" in the region, but he also noted that the UAE did not want to upset the United States.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well. President Barack Obama has set... what are the factors that make one a refugee Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. a foreigner  B. not enough information  C. persecuted person  D. person outside his country of nationality due to security reasons Answer:","output":"D. person outside his country of nationality due to security reasons The definition of a refugee, as established by the 1951 United Nation's Refugee Convention, is someone who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted due to their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. As a result of this fear, they find themselves outside of their home country and are either unable or unwilling to seek protection from their home country. In the context of the question, the correct answer is D. person outside his country of nationality due to security reasons. This option encompasses the essential factors that make one a refugee, which include being outside of their home country and having a well-founded fear of persecution based on the aforementioned criteria. It's crucial to note that refugees differ from other forcibly displaced persons, such as internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers, and stateless individuals. While all these groups have experienced forced displacement, refugees are specifically defined by their inability or unwillingness to return to their home country due to the aforementioned reasons. This distinguishes them from the other categories mentioned, which may have different reasons for their displacement or may still find themselves within their country of origin. The issue of refugees, particularly those coming from war-torn nations in the Middle East, has become a divisive topic in the United States, with differing opinions and levels of support for their resettlement depending on political affiliation. Understanding the factors that make someone a refugee, as well as the challenges they face and the situations that force them to flee their homes, is essential in promoting empathy, informed decision-making, and effective policy regarding the resettlement of refugees."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

In today's world, many people use a mobile phone especially businessmen and businesswomen. These people are an important part of the business world and help our economies develop. In fact in some countries even children and the elderly use mobile phones to keep in touch with family and friends. We know how useful it is to have a mobile phone, but do we know how safe these phones are? Some scientists say that mobile phones could be a risk to our health. So, money is being given to scientific research to find out if mobile phones may be harmful in any way. What does the future look like? Is a hands - free phone the answer? The idea behind hands - free sets is simple and maybe they are a safer way for people to communicate. The hands - free set has a piece in your ear and a microphone near your mouth which is connected to a wire that goes into your phone. Some scientists think this is a much safer way to use a phone. Some scientists have proved that a mobile phone 10 centimeters from your head is far safer than if the headset is right against your ear.

In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.

UPDATED:. 19:48 EST, 10 September 2013. Ed Miliband was met with stony silence by union leaders yesterday, even after dropping plans to dilute their infamous block vote within the Labour Party. Most of his attempt to repair his battered relationship with union barons was met with silence or unenthusiastic applause. And the biggest cheer of the day came from the head of the Public and Commercial Services union, who demanded to know whether he backed the coalition's austerity programme. Scroll down to watch... Pressure: Labour leader Ed Miliband told the Trades Union Congress in Bournemouth that unions had an important part to play in his party. Grilling: Mr Miliband took questions, with TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady looking on. The Labour leader, who owes his job to union voting power, used his speech to argue they are not ‘the enemy within’ and lauded their 6.5million members as ‘the people who make Britain what it is’. But he acknowledged that his party reforms could mean as few as one in ten union members who currently contribute to Labour coffers will do so in future. The changes will ensure members have to specifically opt in for their fees to go to the party. Union leaders lambasted the plans at the weekend, saying Mr Miliband was a ‘schoolboy’ who lives in ‘cloud cuckoo land’. Addressing. the TUC conference in Bournemouth today, Mr Miliband launched a. trenchant defence of trade unionism, rejecting Margaret Thatcher’s. famous description of parts of the movement as enemies. Silence: Large parts of Mr Miliband;s speech were greeted with silence or unenthusiastic applause. But taking questions he faced hostility from public sector workers unhappy at spending cuts designed to cut the nation's debts. Janice Godrich, president of the Public and Commercial Services union which has staged several strikes opposing austerity, used a question and answer session to tackle the Labour leader. She told Mr Miliband: 'Ed Balls says this is the wrong sort of recovery, yet you're committed to the Tories' spending plans. You say the next election will be about living standards; but you're committed to the public sector pay cap. 'Your policies seem contradictory and they're confusing people. Can we get a clear answer: are you for or against austerity?' After appearing taken aback, the Labour leader said: 'We are not in favour of austerity.' But he then risked angering the unions by admitting that Labour would stick to Tory spending limits in order to appear 'credible'. Speaking afterwards Ms Godrich said: 'Austerity isn't working, our members know that and people up and down the country know it. 'It is incredibly disappointing that, in front of an audience of delegates representing more than six million workers, Ed Miliband failed to offer the alternative people so desperately want and need.' In his speech Mr Miliband accused David Cameron of devaluing millions of ordinary workers through his attacks on the unions. ‘We. have a Prime Minister who writes you and your members off,’ he said. ‘Who doesn’t just write you off, but oozes contempt for you from every. pore. What does he say about you? He says your members are a threat to. our economy. Back to the enemy within. ‘Six and a half million people in. Britain. Who teach our children, who look after the sick, who care for. the elderly, who build our homes, who keep our shops open morning, noon. and night. They’re not the enemy within. They’re the people who make. Britain what it is. Finishing touches: Mr Miliband drafted his speech on the train to Bournemouth. ‘How dare he? How dare he insult people, members of trade unions, as he does? How dare he write off whole sections of our society? ‘One Nation Conservatives, would be. turning in their graves if they could hear the nasty, divisive,. small-minded rhetoric of the leader of their once great party. 'We know from recent experience what happens to political leaders who write off whole sections of a country. ‘That’s. what Mitt Romney did when he talked about the 47 per cent of people who. would never vote for him. And look what happened to him.’ Under. the current system, union members automatically pay an annual fee of £3. to the Labour party unless they specifically opt out – swelling party. funds by millions of pounds a year. Mr Miliband has unveiled plans to force trade unionists to actively opt in to the funding of Labour, with the reward that they will become full party members. He told delegates he believes his changes could see his party’s membership increase by 300,000 – a figure critics say will make him a hostage to fortune if it does not come about. But the target number is far fewer than the three million union members who  currently contribute to Labour coffers because they have not opted out. Labour is likely to head off the threat of a huge loss of funds by charging those who opt in more than the current £3 a year. Critics say the reforms could  actually strengthen the unions, because it could see them hanging on to more money designed for political campaigning. Mr Miliband said: ‘It will be a. massive challenge for the Labour Party to reach out to your members in a. way that we have not done for many years and persuade them to be part. of what we do. ‘And, like anything that is hard, it is a risk. But the bigger risk is just saying let’s do it as we have always done it.’ Chuka. Umunna, who is Labour’s business spokesman, said it was important to. ‘take the big money out of politics’ even if it hit the party’s. finances. But backbencher Ian Lavery said Labour faced ruin and meltdown as a result of the ‘ill thought through’ reforms. Yesterday. Len McCluskey, general secretary of the powerful Unite union, called on. Mr Miliband to be even stronger in his defence of union links. ‘Trade unions. have always been a force for good in our society,’ he told a fringe. event at the conference. Instead of attacking, people should look to try. and unite the nation.’ n Mugs celebrating the death in April of Lady Thatcher are on sale at the TUC conference. Bearing. the legend ‘I Still Hate Thatcher’, they are available alongside. T-shirts and mugs with the slogan ‘Tories are Lower than Vermin’. Conservative politicians said the merchandise highlighted the nasty side of the Left. Conor Burns, MP for Bournemouth West, said: ‘She said they couldn’t forgive her because she won and they lost. She was right.’ Unions and Left-wing campaign groups are planning a national day of strikes and civil disobedience on Bonfire Night as part of their campaign against the Government’s austerity programme. Yesterday TUC delegates approved the call for unions to co-ordinate a programme of strikes. The union-backed People’s Assembly had already organised a protest, which was planned to take place on November 5. However this is now set to be directly supported by the unions themselves. Key workers – from nurses to firemen, teachers to postmen – could cause chaos if they decide to join the walkout. The plan raises the possibility of firemen and nurses striking on Guy Fawkes night, a move which could force people to cancel parties due to health and safety fears. Unions are legally allowed to ‘co-ordinate’ their strike action, or organise walkouts on the same day, as long as they have each successfully balloted their workforce on separate trade disputes. This is not the same as organising ‘sympathy strikes’ where workers walk out in support of other striking workers without having held a legal ballot. These were outlawed during the 1980s. Yesterday Unite’s executive director of policy Steve Turner said he believes the ‘yes’ vote has committed the union to a policy of ‘fighting back, industrially where possible’. He added: ‘But more than that, it commits us to organise a mass mobilisation.’ Highlights:","output":"1.

Hyeon-su leaves and talks to her mother Yoon-hee, a successful and talented plastic surgeon. The two have a good mother-daughter relationship. Meanwhile, Su-kyoung is panicking alone in the operating room. She sees a frightening image of a girl in a dark blue dress and long dark hair. Yoon-hee begins the surgery, telling Su-kyoung that it is time to become pretty. A day later, on Hyeon-su's birthday, she argues with her mother about where to have the party and finally decides to do it in her home. Hyeon-su is later in her art class, making a sculpture of Su-kyoung's face. Many girls in the class comment saying that Su-kyoung looks much more attractive than she did before. Hyeon-su accidentally cuts into the face of her sculpture and a large cut subsequently appears on Su-kyoung's cheek. She screams and flees in terror. A mysterious voice shrieks at her saying she wants her face back. Su-kyoung's cut and blood later vanish. Hye-won, another friend, decides to get an eye job from Yoon-hee. Meanwhile, Hyeon-su, Jae-hui and Su-kyoung wait at a bus stop while an old woman gives out fliers for her missing granddaughter. Su-kyoung is distant, troubled by earlier events. The bus arrives but Hyeon-su waits for her friend Sung-eon to come. Jae-hui shows instant dislike for Sung-eon, who is tomboyish and closer to Hyeon-su than her other friends: she also hasn't undergone plastic surgery. The girls all celebrate Hyeon-su's party and Su-kyoung gives her an expensive doll for a present. When lighting the cake, the same ghost girl that Su-kyoung saw appears next to Hyeon-su, but no one else can see her except Su-kyoung. The candles go out.

Probably the most moving track for descendents of immigrants in the new worlds is \\"Two Strong Arms\\". It tells a familiar story really well.

Movie title: Paul Context: Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) are British comic book enthusiasts and best friends who travel to the United States to attend the annual San Diego Comic-Con International, and to take a road trip through the American Southwest to visit sites significant to UFO lore. While driving on a remote desert highway at night, after a tense situation with some rednecks in a diner, Graeme and Clive observe a car driving erratically and then crash. They stop to investigate and offer assistance to the driver, who turns out to be an alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen). Clive faints, but Graeme agrees to assist Paul and gives him a ride. Later, United States Secret Service Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) arrives at the car crash site and informs his unseen female superior, \\"the Big Guy\\" (Sigourney Weaver), that he is closing in on Paul. She sends two inept rookies, Haggard (Bill Hader) and O'Reilly (Joe Lo Truglio), to assist Zoil. Graeme, Clive and Paul camp at an RV park run by two Christian fundamentalists; one-eyed Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig) and her father, Moses. Upon Ruth discovering Paul the next day, the three are forced to take her with them. During an argument about her religion, Paul puts his hand on her forehead and shows her his collective knowledge, after which Ruth realizes that everything she was raised to believe is questionable. Paul later uses his healing powers to cure Ruth's blinded eye and convinces her to moderate her fundamentalist beliefs. The fugitives stop at a bar and Ruth tries to call Moses, but Zoil intercepts the call and she is accosted by the rednecks from the start of their journey, starting a bar fight in the process. Later, at another RV park, Ruth is questioned by Agent Zoil, but claims to know nothing about \\"a one-eyed girl\\" or \\"two British nerds\\".

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

Associated Press. PUBLISHED:. 01:51 EST, 10 March 2014. |. UPDATED:. 10:15 EST, 10 March 2014. A former handyman serving life in prison for the 1993 murder of seven people at a suburban Chicago restaurant has been awarded nearly a half-million dollars in a civil lawsuit in which he alleged a jail guard punched him in the face. Victims' relatives Sunday criticized jurors' decision for James Degorski, who, with an accomplice, shot and stabbed two restaurant owners and five workers at Brown's Chicken and Pasta during a botched robbery. Their bodies were found in a walk-in cooler and freezer. Degorski, now 41, accused a Cook County Jail guard of punching him and breaking his cheekbone and eye socket in 2002 - just after Degorski's arrest in what had been one of the most notorious, unsolved murder cases in Illinois history. Convicted: James Degorski was convicted of killing seven people in a botched restaurant robbery and is serving life in prison. 'If broken bones are worth a half-million, then how much are seven lives worth? This just doesn't feel right,' said Ann Ehlenfeldt, a sister of Richard Ehlenfeldt, one of the owners who was killed. But Degorski's attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, hailed the jury's decision, which came Friday after a three-day trial. 'I think it's a beautiful day for civil rights when a jury can put aside emotions and say we are all entitled to our civil rights,' she said. 'It's about protecting the constitutional rights of the least among us.' Despite the 451,000 award, it's not clear whether Degorski will ever see any of the money. Prison officials could seek to seize it to cover costs of imprisoning Degorski at the Menard Correctional Center, southeast of St. Louis, Bonjean said. The cost of keeping a defendant at that prison is around 20,000 a year, according to data from the Illinois Department of Corrections. And even if the money technically becomes his, Degorski would face strict limits on how much he could spend. Typically, inmates at state prisons are barred from spending more than a few hundred dollars a month at prison commissaries. The guard accused of beating Degorski, former Cook County sheriff's deputy Thomas Wilson, may file an appeal, his attorney, John Winters Jr., said. Winters said he may look for other legal means to ensure Degorski never gets the money. Grisly scene: Police found the bodies in a walk-in refrigerator at the Chicago restaurant. 'I will try to get every dime back out of Mr. Degorski,' he said. Winters said he thought U.S. District Judge Robert Dow, who presided over the civil trial, was wrong to rule jurors could not be told any details of the restaurant killings. Prosecutors have said Degorski and his high school friend, Juan Luna, committed the murders during a robbery that netted them less than 2,000. Luna has also been sentenced to life in prison. 'We were only allowed to say he (Degorski) was convicted of murder. ... It wasn't explained to them how vicious this guy was,' Winters said about jurors in the civil case. That was relevant, he added, because his client did know during the 2002 incident about the chilling allegations against Degorski and believed he needed to be aggressive in subduing him. 'Officer Wilson knew who this guy was,' Winters said. 'So when he was attacked, he was going to respond in kind. We believe this was a case of self-defense.' The jury said Degorski should get 225,000 in compensatory damages, which is the amount Cook County must pay, attorneys said; 226,000 in punitive damages would have to be paid by Wilson. 'The system effectively took the shackles on Mr. Degorski and hid what he really is, and put the shackles on my client,' Winters said.","output":"1. James Degorski, convicted of killing seven people in a botched restaurant robbery, awarded 451,000 in civil lawsuit after alleging jail guard punched him in the face. 2. Victims' relatives criticize jury's decision, questioning the value of seven lives compared to broken bones. 3. Degorski's attorney celebrates the verdict, emphasizing the importance of upholding civil rights for everyone. 4. It is unclear if Degorski will ever receive any of the money, as prison officials could seek to seize it to cover imprisonment costs. 5. The guard accused of assaulting Degorski may file an appeal and pursue other legal means to prevent Degorski from receiving the award."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, occasionally formerly known as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a 45.1 by 55.9 cm (17.8 by 22.0 in) oil painting on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules. In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where as of 2018 it remains.","output":"The painting \\"Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed\\" by William Etty resides in the Tate Gallery as of 2018."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is over thirty kilometres long and in places nearly 300 meters deep. It is cold and dark and not many people went there until after 1930. Then a road was made around the lake. Holiday makers began to use the road, and this was when the stories began. Someone said that he had seen a monster in the lake. He said it was twelve meters long. It had a long neck and a small head. Then someone else said he had seen it. Others said the same thing and in 1933 a London doctor took a photo. It looked like a monster with a long neck and a thick body but the photo was not dear. The newspapers printed the picture and called it the Loch Ness monster, or \\"Nessie\\". Then the argument began. Some people, however, were certain there was something living in the lake. Others said there was nothing there. In 1961, a lot of people joined together to make a real effort to see and photograph the monster if there was one! Several times people thought they saw something but after ten years there was still no real proof. Later underwater television cameras were used, but no one found any real proof. However, they did find something interesting: a huge underwater cave. It was big enough to be home of a monster, but of course, this was not a proof. In 1975, however, some American scientists formed a search group. They used an underwater camera. It took pictures every seventy seconds. Some of the pictures seemed to show a red-brown creature. Its body was about four meters long and had a very ugly head on the end of a four meter neck. Many people then began to believe in the monster. But even today we can not be certain.

Q: Why was the narrator awake at such a rough hour ?","output":"The narrator was awakened at such a rough hour, specifically at 3 am, due to option (4), animals awoke them. In this case, the animals involved were cats. The presence of a growling cat and the sound of cat-patter across the room disrupted the narrator's sleep, causing them to get up and check on the situation. The growling sound from the cat closely resembled the sound typically heard from a cat experiencing physical pain. This caused concern for the narrator, prompting them to investigate and ensure the wellbeing of their cats. As they turned on the light, they witnessed one cat chasing the other, growling, out of the room. This indicates that there was some form of altercation or disagreement between the two cats, resulting in the disruptive noises that awoke the narrator. It's worth mentioning that cats can be active during nighttime hours, as they are naturally crepuscular animals – meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk. This nocturnal behavior may have contributed to the incident occurring at such an inconvenient hour for the narrator. Additionally, territorial disputes, play, or a sudden onset of fear or stress could have caused the confrontation between the two cats, leading to the growling and chasing noises. To summarize, the narrator was awakened at 3 am due to the sounds of their cats being involved in some form of altercation or disagreement. The noises created by these animals, which included growling and the pattering of their feet as they chased one another, were disruptive enough to disturb the narrator's sleep and prompt an investigation into the situation at hand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - A nail , as a unit of cloth measurement , is generally a sixteenth of a yard or 21  4 inches ( 5.715 cm ) . The nail was apparently named after the practice of hammering brass nails into the counter at shops where cloth was sold . On the other hand , R D Connor , in The weights and measures of England ( p 84 ) states that the nail was the 16th part of a Roman foot , i.e. , digitus or finger , although he provides no reference to support this . Zupko 's A dictionary of weights and measures for the British Isles ( p 256 ) states that the nail was originally the distance from the thumbnail to the joint at the base of the thumb , or alternately , from the end of the middle finger to the second joint . An archaic usage of the term nail is as a sixteenth of a ( long ) hundredweight for mass , or 1 clove of 7 pound avoirdupois ( 3.175 kg ) .  - In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object.

For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness.  - An inch (abbreviation: in or ) is a unit of length in the imperial and United States customary systems of measurement now formally equal to yard but usually understood as of a foot. Derived from the Roman uncia (\\"twelfth\\"), \\"inch\\" is also sometimes used to translate related units in other measurement systems, usually understood as deriving from the width of the human thumb.

Suggested answer: Payment terms are usually included on the invoice. Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"Partially accurate, as it captures only one aspect of the use of a sales invoice. A more comprehensive answer would be: A sales invoice is a critical financial document generated by a business to request payment from a customer for goods or services rendered. It serves several essential purposes, and payment terms are indeed usually included on the invoice. However, merely mentioning payment terms does not sufficiently define the use of a sales invoice. Some key uses of a sales invoice are: 1. Requesting payment: A sales invoice serves as a formal request for payment from the customer, detailing the transaction, the amount due, the due date, and payment terms. 2. Record-keeping: Sales invoices help both the seller and the buyer maintain accurate financial records of their transactions. These records are essential for bookkeeping, accounting, tax reporting, and auditing purposes.  3. Legal proof: In the event of a legal dispute between the seller and the buyer, a sales invoice acts as proof of the transaction and helps resolve any disagreements, protecting both parties' interests. 4. Tax reporting: Sales invoices are necessary for preparing tax returns as businesses are required to report their sales, which are typically calculated based on invoices issued during a specific period. 5. Tracking sales: Invoices allow businesses to track sales and customer payment habits, which is vital for cash flow management and forecasting. 6. Payment terms: As mentioned in the suggested answer, payment terms are usually included on the invoice. This information is essential for both parties to be aware of the payment expectations and to avoid any misunderstandings or late payments. In conclusion, the use of a sales invoice goes beyond just including payment terms. It is a vital document that serves multiple purposes in facilitating and documenting financial transactions between businesses and their customers. It is important to validate this broader understanding of the use of a sales invoice to provide a more accurate and informed perspective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach - The stomach churns the food - With the aid of stomach acids - The food becomes a thick liquid - Is then passed to the small intestine.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose food stays in stomach longer happens, how will it affect MORE digestion occuring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If food stays in the stomach longer than usual, it can have both direct and indirect effects on the digestion process. A perturbation in the stomach's ability to move food through the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract can impact the digestion process in various ways, depending on the reason behind the delayed gastric emptying. Direct Effects: 1. Enhanced mechanical breakdown: If food stays in the stomach longer, it would be subjected to more extended periods of churning and mechanical breakdown, which can result in a more thorough disintegration of food particles. This could potentially improve the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine by increasing the surface area for enzyme activity. 2. More extended exposure to stomach acid: The longer the food stays in the stomach, the longer it is exposed to stomach acid. Extended exposure to stomach acid (hydrochloric acid) allows for more digestion of proteins via pepsin, breaking them into smaller peptides, which can also improve their absorption in the small intestine. However, highly acidic chyme for prolonged periods might irritate the lining of the small intestine, affecting the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. Indirect Effects: 1. Altered enzyme secretion: If food stays in the stomach longer, the acid-producing cells (parietal cells) and enzyme-secreting cells (chief cells) of the stomach may alter their secretions as a response. This modification can impact the pH levels and enzyme activities in the stomach, which can either improve or impair the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestines. 2. Hormonal changes: Delayed gastric emptying may lead to changes in the hormonal regulation of digestion (e.g., gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin). These hormones play a crucial role in the secretion of enzymes, controlling stomach motility, and regulating the absorption of nutrients. Altered levels of these hormones may impact the digestive process in the small intestines as well as the overall functioning of the GI tract. 3. Bacterial overgrowth: An extended stay of food in the stomach may result in the growth of bacteria, which can lead to bacterial overgrowth in the small intestines. This bacterial overgrowth can interfere with the digestion and absorption of nutrients and may cause bloating, gas, and other GI symptoms. 4. Nutrient deficiencies: Prolonged retention of food in the stomach may eventually lead to inefficient absorption of nutrients in the small intestines. This may result in symptoms related to nutrient deficiencies, depending on which nutrients are not properly absorbed. In conclusion, the perturbation that occurs when food stays longer in the stomach can have both direct and indirect effects on digestion. Depending on the underlying cause and the mechanisms at play, these effects could range from improved digestion to compromised nutrient absorption and digestion-related complications. Further investigation into the reasons behind the delayed gastric emptying is necessary to determine the exact impact on an individual's digestion process."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Background: Fred McFeely Rogers (March 20, 1928 - February 27, 2003) was an American television personality, musician, puppeteer, writer, producer, and Presbyterian minister. Rogers was famous for creating, hosting and composing the theme music for the educational preschool television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1968-2001), which featured his kind-hearted grandfatherly personality, and direct connection to his audiences. Originally trained and ordained as a minister, Rogers was displeased with the way television addressed children at the time, and made an effort to change this when he began to write for and perform on local Pittsburgh-area shows dedicated to youth. Rogers developed his own show on WQED in 1968, and it was distributed nationwide by Eastern Educational Television Network. Context: During the controversy surrounding the introduction of the household VCR, Rogers was involved in supporting the manufacturers of VCRs in court. His 1979 testimony, in the case Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., noted that he did not object to home recordings of his television programs, for instance, by families in order to watch them together at a later time. This testimony contrasted with the views of others in the television industry who objected to home recordings or believed that devices to facilitate it should be taxed or regulated.  When the case reached the Supreme Court in 1983, the majority decision considered the testimony of Rogers when it held that the Betamax video recorder did not infringe copyright. The Court stated that his views were a notable piece of evidence \\"that many [television] producers are willing to allow private time-shifting to continue\\" and even quoted his testimony in a footnote:  Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the Neighborhood at hours when some children cannot use it ... I have always felt that with the advent of all of this new technology that allows people to tape the Neighborhood off-the-air, and I'm speaking for the Neighborhood because that's what I produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of their family's television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been \\"You are an important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions.\\" Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important. Question: what was the case outcome?. Whats the answer?","output":"The case outcome of Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. was a Supreme Court decision in favor of Sony. The majority decision held that the Betamax video recorder did not infringe on copyright.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose film score dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance?  Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here's \\"Have a Cigar\\" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \\"Pink\\" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \\"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: \\"The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\\" Waters commented: \\"it's about none of us really being there ... [it] should have been called Wish We Were Here\\".O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to \\"Comfortably Numb\\": \\"I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone.\\" Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, \\"Jugband Blues\\": \\"I'm most obliged to you for making...

Internet Explorer (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer and Windows Internet Explorer, commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included in the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows. The browser is discontinued, but still maintained.  Internet Explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers, attaining a peak of about 95% usage share during 2002 and 2003. This came after Microsoft used bundling to win the first browser war against Netscape, which was the dominant browser in the 1990s. Its usage share has since declined with the launch of Firefox (2004) and Google Chrome (2008), and with the growing popularity of operating systems such as macOS, Linux, iOS and Android that do not run Internet Explorer. Estimates for Internet Explorer's overall market share range from 3.91% to 16.84% or by StatCounter's numbers ranked 3rd, just after Firefox (or even as low as 5th when counting all platforms), (browser market share is notoriously difficult to calculate).

He is tended by a nurse, Julie Benson, and they have fallen in love. Corey's military pal, Steve Connolly, arrives in early November to discuss plans for the ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona, they plan to purchase and operate together once Corey is out of the hospital. The two men pool their G.I. benefits (totaling 40,000) to do so. Corey's final surgery is in mid-December, but Connolly does not appear at the hospital afterward to see his friend. By Christmas, Corey is still in recovery but Connolly still remains absent.

I have a new situation: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.  But I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  What is an answer for this question: Which candidate will Mike not vote for?","output":"Based on the given information and Mike's concern for the environment and saving the planet, it is clear that he will not vote for Jessica. Jessica's stance of emitting more anthropogenic gases goes against the scientific consensus on the dangers of global warming and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Milly's position aligns more closely with Mike's environmental interests, as she suggests decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, which is in line with the recommendations of climate scientists to mitigate climate change and its adverse effects on the natural environment and our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The review provided under the title \\"Don't Bother\\" can be considered negative for several reasons. Let's analyze the content to understand why this is the case: 1. The title itself, \\"Don't Bother\\", immediately sets a negative tone. It suggests that the subject in question is not worth the time and effort, discouraging others from engaging with it.  2. The opening statement, \\"This is not even worth listening to,\\" further emphasizes the negative perspective of the reviewer. By stating that it's not worth listening to, the reviewer implies that the music holds no value or appeal. 3. The reviewer then goes on to mention their familiarity with the artist's previous work: \\"I've heard some of this guy's music before and he has not gotten any better.\\" This statement compares the current work unfavorably to the artist's past efforts, indicating that the reviewer finds all the artist's music lacking in quality or progress over time.  4. The final sentence of the review seals its negative status: \\"I think it's time for him to find another hobby!\\" This remark not only suggests that the artist should stop pursuing music but also implies that their skills are better suited for an alternative endeavor. By implying that the artist should quit, the reviewer is showcasing a lack of appreciation or support for the subject matter. In conclusion, the review is unquestionably negative based on its discouraging title, the reviewer's comments on the music's low quality, their perception that the artist's skills haven't improved over time, and the suggestion for the artist to find another hobby. The language and connotations used throughout the review clearly communicate the reviewer's dissatisfaction and negative sentiments towards the artist and their music."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's fun, healthy and eco-friendly. Maybe that's why there are 1.4 billion bicycles and only 400 million cars on roads worldwide today. Bikes can take you almost anywhere, and there is no fuel cost! Hop on a bicycle and ride around your neighborhood. You may discover something new in your community. Stopping and getting off a bike is easier than stopping and getting out of your car. In many communities, you can bike to work and benefit from exercise without polluting the environment. You don't even have to ride all the way. Folding bikes work well for workers who ride the train. Just fold the bike and take it with you. Have you ever thought about bicycling across a foreign country? It's a great way to experience another culture, see beautiful scenery and meet friendly people. Bicycle enthusiast Goran Kropp bicycled across not just one country but several. He rode a remarkable 11,000 km from his home in Sweden to Nepal and then climbed Mount Everest! And now, bicycling across a country to raise money for a charity or to advertise a cause is also popular. To encourage people to bike, many cities in Europe have established bike-share programs. In Paris, for example, thousands of bikes are parked at bike stations around the city. Users can rent bikes at any station. The first half-hour of use is free. After that, users pay a small fee. When they've finished riding, they simply park their bikes at any station. For people who don't want to drive, the bikes are an excellent alternative to buses and taxis, which burn fuel and cause pollution. As a result of the success of bike plans in Europe, they're spreading to the US., Australia and other countries as well. Look for one in your city soon. Question: According to this passage, workers in some cities can take their bikes   _  . Answer: A:","output":"According to this passage, workers in some cities can take their bikes onto public transportation.

Article: Animals are a favorite subject of many photographers. Cats, dogs, and other pets top the list, followed by zoo animals. However, because it's hard to get them to sit still and \\"perform on command,\\" some professional photographers refuse to photograph pets.               One way to get an appealing portrait of a cat or dog is to hold a biscuit or treat above the camera. The animal's longing look toward the food will be captured by the camera, but the treat won't appear in the picture because it's out of the camera's range. When you show the picture to your friends afterwards, they'll be impressed by your pet's loving expression. If you are using fast film, you can take some good, quick shots of a pet by simply snapping a picture right after calling its name. You'll get a different expression from your pet using this technique. Depending on your pet's mood, the picture will capture an interested, curious expression or possibly a look of annoyance, especially if you've awakened it from a nap. Taking pictures of zoo animals requires a little more patience. After all, you can't wake up a lion! You may have to wait for a while until the animal does something interesting or moves into a position for you to get a good shot. When photographing zoo animals, don't get too close to the cages, and never tap on the glass or throw things between the bars of a cage. Concentrate on shooting some good pictures, and always respect the animals you are photographing. Question: What is the advantage of calling your pet's name when taking a shot of it? Options: A: To help your pet look its best. B: To make sure that your pet sits still. C: To keep your pet awake for a while. D: To catch a different expression of your pet. The answer is:","output":"D: To catch a different expression of your pet. In the article, it is mentioned that calling your pet's name when taking a shot of it allows you to capture a different expression from your pet using this technique. Depending on the pet's mood, the picture might capture an interested, curious expression, or possibly a look of annoyance if you've awakened it from a nap. This suggests that calling your pet's name gives you the opportunity to capture a more candid and unique expression, providing a more engaging and dynamic photograph."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some parties are at private homes. But in recent years, it has become more and more common for Americans to go to a hotel or eating-place on the night of December 31st. There, they can eat a big dinner, drink champagne, and dance to orchestra music. Most New Year's parties are usually noisy. People shout and sing. And often, guests blow on small noisemakers when the new year arrives at midnight. This tradition of noise making is believed to start centuries ago. People thought that loud sounds would drive away the bad spirits of the old year. The biggest, noisiest New Year's party in the US takes place in Times Square in New York. Thousands of people gather  there. Some of them ring bells and set fireworks. Others blow whistles of car horns . And at twelve o'clock, they begin to cheer as an electric sign in the shape of a red apple lights up on top of a tall building. The Times Square celebration includes another well-known American tradition. Since 1929, the band of musician Guy Lombardo has given a concert on New Year's Eve. Guy Lombardo died in 1977. But, Bill Lombardo, has kept the tradition alive with a band concert at a New York city hotel. When the crowds in Times Square start cheering the arrival of the new year, television cameras show the band playing the song Auld Lang Syne.

She has two brothers, Martin and Steve, who plays in her concert band as of 2017, and a sister, Gina. Martina's parents, Daryl and Jeanne Schiff, owned a dairy farm. Daryl, who was also a cabinetry shop owner, exposed Martina to country music at a young age. Released in 1995, Wild Angels accounted for another top five hit in its lead single \\"Safe in the Arms of Love\\", which had previously been recorded by both Wild Choir and Baillie & the Boys, and was concurrently released in Canada by Michelle Wright at the time of McBride's version. The album's title track went on to become McBride's first No. 1 single on the country charts in early 1996. However, the three follow-ups,\\"Phones Are Ringin' All Over Town\\", \\"Swingin' Doors\\" and \\"Cry on the Shoulder of the Road\\" were less successful, reaching the lower regions of the top 40.  In early 1997, after \\"Cry on the Shoulder of the Road\\" peaked, McBride released two duets. \\"Still Holding On\\", a duet with Clint Black which was the lead-off single to her album Evolution and his album Nothin' but the Taillights, and \\"Valentine\\", a collaboration with pop pianist Jim Brickman which appeared on his album Picture This. She also sang duet vocals on \\"Chances Are\\" with Bob Seger, featured on the soundtrack of the 1998 motion picture Hope Floats.

A:","output":"The conspiracy to break up Dido and Aeneas primarily involved Jupiter, Mercury, and Dido's sister Anna, along with other supporting characters and circumstances in Vergil's \\"Aeneid.\\" A detailed analysis of the characters and events that led to the ultimate separation of Dido and Aeneas is provided below. 1. Jupiter: As the king of the gods in Roman mythology, Jupiter played a major role in orchestrating the events in \\"Aeneid.\\" He held great concern for Aeneas' preordained destiny of founding Rome, which would become a mighty empire. Jupiter feared that Aeneas' love affair with Dido could hinder his quest, prompting the god to take action. 2. Mercury: Jupiter sent the messenger god Mercury to deliver a message to Aeneas. Mercury informed Aeneas of his divine mission to establish Rome and the great future that awaited him. This message served as a warning and urged Aeneas to leave Carthage immediately, ensuring he stayed on course to fulfill his destiny. Mercury was instrumental in influencing Aeneas spiritually, reminding him of the consequences of wavering from his preordained path. 3. Dido's sister, Anna: While Anna did not deliberately conspire against the couple, her actions contributed to the turmoil between Dido and Aeneas. Unaware of Jupiter's intervention and Aeneas' true intentions, Anna encouraged her sister, the Queen of Carthage, to express her love for Aeneas and strengthen their bond. As a result, Aeneas was torn between his love for Dido and his duty to fulfill his destiny. Ultimately, his dedication to Rome led to the tragic breakup. 4. Other characters and circumstances: A variety of supporting characters and circumstances contributed to Dido and Aeneas' separation. Aeneas' deceased father, Anchises, and the ghost of Celaeno (a harpy) warned him of the dangers he would face if he didn't proceed to Italy. Additionally, Dido's deceased husband, Sychaeus, appeared in her dreams, urging her to move on and not to be bound to Aeneas, further complicating the situation. In conclusion, the conspiracy to break up Dido and Aeneas involved a complex interplay of divine intervention, well-intended advice from loved ones, and destiny itself. These competing forces challenged the lovers' happiness, eventually leading to their tragic separation and Dido's eventual suicide. Vergil's \\"Aeneid\\" serves as a reminder of the power that fate and circumstance can hold over human relationships and ambitions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(IV) They got good medical news ..","output":"The narrator is feeling relieved leaving the office because of option (III) They didn't pay as much as expected. In the given text passage, the narrator expresses their initial reaction to the amount by wincing, which indicates that the thought of having to pay around five hundred dollars is distressing or causes discomfort. However, the other person in the conversation informs the narrator that the doctors have written off any difference, which means they no longer need to worry about paying the full amount. Instead, the narrator is only responsible for a 20 co-pay. This information is a source of relief for the narrator, as it significantly reduces the financial burden they expected to face. By only having to pay 20 instead of the initial five hundred dollars, the narrator's concerns regarding payment are alleviated, and they can leave the office without the additional stress that comes with carrying such a financial responsibility. The other options (I, II, and IV) are not related to the passage or the situation mentioned in it. The text does not provide any information about the narrator receiving a job offer, getting a new job, or receiving good medical news.

Translate the following sentence to French: The panellists responded to comments and queries addressed to them.","output":"Step 1: Identify the elements of the sentence.     The sentence is basically simple and straightforward. Its elements are subject \\"The panellists\\",     verb phrase \\"responded to\\", and object \\"comments and queries addressed to them\\". Step 2: Apply the basic rule to translate English to French.     The basic rule is that French language usually follows a Subject-Verb-Object sentence structure,     similar to English. However, French has some specific rules that need to be respected.      In particular, when translating the idea of something being \\"addressed to\\" someone, we use the      preposition \\"à\\" in French. In this context, it should be noted that the noun that comes     immediately after the verb usually matches the gender and number with the subject in French. Step 3: Run the translation.     The English to French translation of the sentence \\"The panellists responded to comments and     queries addressed to them\\" becomes \\"Les panélistes ont répondu aux commentaires et questions      qui leur ont été adressées\\". Explanation for the translation:     \\"The panellists\\" translates to \\"Les panélistes\\". French generally use definite articles more      often than English.      \\"Responded to\\" translates to \\"ont répondu à\\". The verb 'to respond' is translated as 'répondre'     in French and is used with the auxiliary 'avoir' (ont) when in the compound past tense.     The conjunction \\"and\\" is translated to \\"et\\".      \\"Comments\\" and \\"queries\\" translate to \\"commentaires\\" and \\"questions\\".      \\"Addressed to them\\" is a relative clause in English and can be translated with \\"qui leur ont été     adressées\\" in French. In French, we use the relative pronoun 'qui' to refer to the subject      of the clause ('comments and queries'), 'leur' as the indirect object pronoun referring to 'them'      (the panelists), 'ont été' is the auxiliary verb 'être' in the past tense, and 'adressées' is      the past participle of 'adresser', matching in number and gender with the subject.

Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975. Although they initially lasted just two and a half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, \\"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\\", they are considered one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music, having initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom, and inspired many later punk rock, thrash metal and alternative rock musicians.  - The Big Knockover is the Swedish punk group No Fun at All 's third album , released on July 13 , 1997 . All music by Mikael Danielsson except track 1 , which was co-written by Jimmie Olsson . All lyrics by Ingemar Jansson . Published by Misty Music .  - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices.  - Burning Heart Records is an independent record label formed in 1993 and based in Örebro, Sweden. It has a close affiliation with Californian label Epitaph Records, who own the rights to distribute Burning Heart's output in North America. It also started a German office in Berlin in the end of 2003.  - Epitaph Records is a Hollywood-based independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. The label was originally \\"just a logo and a P.O. box\\" created in the 1980s for the purpose of selling Bad Religion records, but has evolved into a large independent record label. Gurewitz took the name from a King Crimson song of the same name. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most of the bands on Epitaph were punk and pop punk groups, while there are many post-hardcore and bands signed to the label as well. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid. Several sister-labels also exist, such as ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Fat Possum Records, Hellcat Records and Heart & Skull Records that have signed other types of bands.  - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.  - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.  - No Fun at All (often abbreviated to just NFAA) is a Swedish punk rock band. The band formed in the summer of 1991 in Skinnskatteberg. The group initially consisted of Mikael Danielsson (guitar), Henrik Sunvisson (bass guitar) and Jimmy Olsson (vocals, drums). The name was inspired by a tongue-in-cheek version of The Stooges' song \\"No Fun\\" as covered by the Sex Pistols, and the name of the band Sick of It All. The group released their albums on the Swedish label Burning Heart Records outside the United States. Within the U.S., No Fun at All's albums were released by Theologian Records and later by Epitaph Records.

Natalie Martinez reports. (Published Monday, March 24, 2014)      Chicago Transit Authority union president Robert Kelly says the operator of a Blue Line train that derailed at O'Hare early Monday may have dozed off.      Kelly says early indications show this may explain why the eight-car train jumped the tracks and landed on the stairs and escalators leading to the airport terminals just before 3 a.m.      \\"The indication is there, yes,\\" Kelly said about whether the operator dozed off. \\"She has worked a lot of hours in the past weekend, and the indication is there.\\"      According to Kelly, the female train operator had 17 hours off between her shifts, which was ample time to get the necessary rest.

(Published Monday, March 24, 2014)      \\"She has assured me there is no problem with her passing the drug and alcohol, so that is not a factor in this,\\" Kelly said.      At a news conference Monday, National Transportation Safety Board signal specialist Tim Depaepe said the motorman started her shift at about 8:40 p.m. Sunday.      \\"When she is released, we will make arrangements to interview her and find out what happened from her point of view,\\" DePaepe said.      Kelly said the operator, who has been employed with the CTA for about a year, will be interviewed by the NTSB on Tuesday.      The train operator was walking, talking and answering questions afterward, fire officials said. She was taken to the hospital with injuries to her leg and later released.

(Associated Press)      National Transportation Safety Board officials will be back Tuesday at O'Hare International Airport, where a Chicago Transit Authority train crashed early Monday morning at the airport stop.      More than 30 people suffered non-life-threatening injuries.      Transportation expert Joseph Schwieterman says it's \\"a miracle that nobody died.\\"      He says the accident likely would have been far worse had it happened during the day, when the trains are often full and the escalator packed with people heading into O'Hare.      The union representing the operator says she may have dozed off. The NTSB hasn't drawn conclusions, saying it will scrutinize the train's breaks, signals and other potential factors. ||||| Federal investigators will focus on whether a CTA train operator fell asleep at the controls and if an automatic braking system was working properly as they seek to pinpoint the cause of a spectacular crash Monday that left a Blue Line car perched atop an escalator.      The operator may have fallen asleep shortly before her train smashed through a “bumping post” at the end of the track at O'Hare International Airport just before 3 a.m., according to a transit union representative.      The CTA employee, whose name has not been released, said after the crash that she was tired, said Robert Kelly, president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 308.      “I can confirm that she was extremely tired,” Kelly said.      “Indications are she might have dozed off.”      Other crucial issues that will come under sharp focus in the inquiry include whether the train was speeding as it entered the station at the airport and whether the safety control system was working.      The train was traveling with such momentum that it smashed through a barrier designed to stop trains at the end of the line, jumped the platform and climbed the escalator.      More than 30 people were hurt, though none of the injuries was considered life-threatening, officials said. Had the incident occurred at any time other than the middle of the night, scores could have been killed or injured, experts said.      Blue Line service to the airport will be halted until authorities finish studying the crash site and decide how to remove the wreckage. The CTA late Monday declined to say when the station might reopen.      The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, which temporarily halted commuter rail service to one of the country's busiest airports.      The CTA is shuttling passengers to O'Hare from the nearby Rosemont stop for the time being.      The front car of the eight-car train remained wedged atop the escalator late Monday.      “The train is not going to go anywhere for the foreseeable future,” said Tim DePaepe, an NTSB railroad accident investigator. “We need to examine the train and the position it's in prior to its movement.”      The NTSB will also try to determine how fast the train was going when the crash occurred.      Officials said the train did not carry an event data recorder. Typically, the CTA's older-model 2600 Series cars, like the ones in Monday's crash, do not have event recorders.      However, the train did have an outward-facing video system, DePaepe said, and officials are reviewing the recording and several others. They also are examining the signals and tracks to see if there were problems or malfunctions.      The crash happened about 2:50 a.m., one of the station's lightest traffic times.      “I heard a boom and when I got off the train, the train was all the way up the escalator. It's a wreck,” Denise Adams, who was riding toward the back of the train, told reporters.      “It was a lot of panic because it was hard to get people off the train.”      CTA President Forrest Claypool said safety is the agency's top priority. ||||| Summary:","output":"On March 24, 2014, a Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) Blue Line Train derailed at O'Hare Airport, leaving 32 people injured. The eight-car train jumped the tracks and landed on the stairs and escalators leading to airport terminals around 3 a.m. The train operator was suspected to have dozed off, as she had worked many hours over the weekend preceding the accident. CTA union president, Robert Kelly, reported that the female train operator had 17 hours off between her shifts, which should have provided enough time for adequate rest.

His gang consists of skilled operatives, each possessing unique talents that make them indispensable members of the group. They manage to stay under the radar, leaving little to no traces or clues connecting them to their crimes. Lorenz has been planning the most daring and audacious heist of his career: the robbery of the city's impregnable Central Bank. Plot Summary: Lorenz has his eyes set on the immense wealth stored at the city's Central Bank. He assembles his trusted squad - a getaway driver, a weapons expert, a hacker, and a stealthy infiltrator - and meticulously lays out the plan for robbing the Central Bank. To ensure a successful heist, the team works round the clock to gather all the necessary intel about the target location, including security protocols, guards' routines, and floor plans. Meanwhile, Detective Harding, an honest cop who has tirelessly pursued Lorenz's gang for years, receives an anonymous tip about the master plan. With this information in hand, Detective Harding and his team begin putting the pieces together, preparing to stop the heist before it occurs. As Lorenz's gang commences operations, they demonstrate exceptional coordination, bypassing security systems and outwitting law enforcement. However, Detective Harding, constantly one step behind, fervently tries to anticipate the gang's every move. As the tension mounts, Lorenz and Harding become increasingly focused on outwitting one another. Unbeknownst to them, the anonymous tipster, a former confidante of Lorenz, seeks revenge on both parties for different reasons - he wants to exploit their rivalry to take down Lorenz’s gang and cripple the city’s law enforcement, giving him free reign over the city. Climax: On the day of the heist, Lorenz's gang expertly executes their plan, breaching the Central Bank's vault. However, Detective Harding arrives in the nick of time, resulting in an intense standoff as both factions square off. The situation, already tense, escalates even further as the treacherous informant reveals himself, throwing both Lorenz and Harding off balance. Resolution: Realizing they have a common enemy, Lorenz and Harding forge an uneasy alliance to bring down the turncoat, who is arrested and handed over to the authorities. The Central Bank heist is thwarted. While Lorenz's gang manages to escape, they stay out of sight and lay low for some time. Despite the close encounter, Lorenz knows he cannot escape forever, and both he and Harding acknowledge the inevitability of their next confrontation. The movie ends with an air of uncertainty, leaving room for a potential sequel that would further explore the paths of Lorenz and Detective Harding. The Cunning Crusade of Lorenz's Gang promises to be a thrilling, action-packed, and suspenseful journey that showcases the lengths to which intelligent criminals will go to achieve their ends, and the tireless efforts of law enforcement to stop them. Central themes of trust, betrayal, and the desire for vengeance intertwine, creating a gripping cinema experience that will leave audiences captivated."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With the advent of online shopping and chain stores, for many the high street has changed beyond recognition over the last century. But as these pictures show, some businesses have remained immune to the whims of fashion, surviving - and prospering - in spite of the profusion of high-street stores and out-of-town shopping centres. From a cobbler to a pub, some have proved that by bucking the trends and remaining true to their roots, they have flourished in the cut-throat world of business. Current director William Lobb the great great grandson of John Lobb who started the bootmakers in 1849 in London. The original shop on Regent Street with William Lobb (centre) the second generation of Lobb men to run the shop in 1849 in London. Keeping up the family tradition: The cobbler. business has been passed down from generation to generation and. maintains its position on London's high street. The ornate exterior of James Smith and Sons Umbrellas and Sticks on New Oxford Street in London. The long-running business has survived the changing face of the High Street and is a familiar face on the capital's busy street. One example is a bootmaker that is 165 years old - and has seen prime ministers and singers pass through their doors. Frequented. by British prime ministers, Frank Sinatra and Laurence Olivier, John. Lobb, Bootmaker was founded in 1849 and has been family-run for five. generations. 'We have a way. of working which might be considered old fashioned, but it's necessary. to our work,' said Jonathan Lobb, 44, director and last-maker at John. Lobb Bootmaker. 'As soon as. we change something, something else goes awry. It's the nature of what. we do - and it's something you can't just suddenly change.' The. original John Lobb started out as an apprentice in Cornwall, but. decided to move to Australia and set up on his own after failing to find. a position in London. The long-enduring firms include Truefitt and Hill with employee Gino Ruso helping to maintain the business at the oldest hairdresser and barber shop. Truefitt and Hill is one of Britain's oldest hairdressers and barber shop, open since 1805, in London. Unchanged: Paxton and Whitfield Cheese Shop, open since 1797, on Jermyn Street.

After founding a successful business there, he made the move back to London, initially setting up shop on Regent Street, before moving to its current St James's Street home. 'It's a family business, which gives it a different feel. Working for a company with this history is quite a privilege,' Jonathan added. 'To my mind, and I've been here for the last twenty years, the history contributes to the character of the company.' Another beloved institution is the historic Princess Louise pub in Holborn, London. Still a hit: The famous pie shop has flourished despite the dramatic changes that have hit the British shopping scene in the last few centuries.

Pine city was located in the mountains, and was inhabited by nature lovers and people that protected the environment. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops.  Which city contributed less to the creation of dead zones? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Bird City has contributed less to the creation of dead zones.  Dead zones are areas in bodies of water, such as rivers or oceans, where oxygen levels are too low to support most life forms. These are primarily caused by high levels of nutrient runoff, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, from agricultural activities. These nutrients encourage the growth of excessive amounts of algae, which upon decomposing, consumes the available oxygen in the area, leading to hypoxic conditions and dead zones. Pine City, situated in the mountains, is inhabited by nature lovers and people dedicated to protecting the environment. This suggests that the city may prioritize using sustainable and eco-friendly methods for agriculture, reducing the use of fertilizers, and preventing excessive nutrient runoff into nearby water sources. Such practices may include organic farming and natural methods of pest control that do not involve chemicals. Moreover, the residents of Pine City might be more inclined to preserve and maintain the natural balance of their surrounding ecosystem, which can help minimize the formation of dead zones. On the other hand, Bird City, which is situated on the banks of a large river, relies mostly on conventional agriculture and is known to use fertilizers for their crops. This suggests that there may be a higher amount of nutrient runoff entering the river from Bird City compared to Pine City. In turn, this can contribute more to the formation of dead zones downstream, especially in the areas where the river flows into the sea. The increased use of fertilizers for agriculture has been linked to the growth of dead zones in coastal regions around the world. However, it is essential to note that the information provided does not give enough context to determine the precise situations in both cities. Factors such as population, overall land usage, water treatment and conservation measures should be taken into account for a more accurate evaluation. Yet, based on the background given, it would seem that Bird City may contribute less to creating dead zones relative to Pine City. In summary, adopting sustainable agricultural practices and prioritizing environmental conservation can significantly reduce a city's contribution to dead zones and promote a healthier ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Archaeological finds date back to the Neolithic period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the Roman Empire in the first century AD. The city grew wealthy from trade caravans; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the Great Colonnade, the Temple of Bel, and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of Amorites, Arameans, and Arabs. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke Palmyrene (a dialect of Aramaic), while using Greek for commercial and diplomatic purposes. Greco-Roman culture influenced the culture of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic deities, Mesopotamian and Arab gods. By the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by regent Queen Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian destroyed the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic.

Flight crew on a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 first spotted an unmanned drone as the jumbo jet made its final approach on a flight from London last Sunday evening. The captain told officials that the drone was flying at an altitude of around 3,000ft in airspace over Nassau County, just east of the airport. A Virgin Atlantic pilot alerted air traffic control after spotting a drone at an altitude of 3,000ft. Radio-controlled drones have skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the growing trend of aerial photography. Around a minute later, a Delta Air Lines pilot who was behind the controls of a Boeing 737 arriving from San Diego told air traffic controllers that the drone was flying too close to its left wing as it flew over Nassau County, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). According to an audio recording obtained by NBC News, the Delta pilot told the air traffic control tower: ‘We just had something fly over us. I don’t know if it was a drone or a balloon, it just came real quick.’ Another incident was reported on Wednesday afternoon as a JetBlue plane from Savannah, Georgia, prepared to land at JFK. Nassau County police were unable to locate the drone during an aerial search by helicopter. The drone was flying at about 400ft as it buzzed near the Airbus A320 over Nassau County. Air traffic control recordings captured the pilot's concern telling controllers that the drone looked like it was flying right on the final approach, NBC reported. Despite raising concerns, none of the pilots had to take evasive action and all three planes landed safely. A drone was flying at about 400ft as it buzzed a JetBlue Airbus A320 over Nassau County. Local police, the FBI and FAA were all notified, and Nassau County police were unable to locate the drone or its operator during an aerial search by helicopter. If the operator is identified, he or she could face criminal charges. Unmanned drones have skyrocketed in popularity thanks to the growing trend of aerial photography, and they have become a serious problem for airports and pilots as many operators are not aware of the rules or dangers. There have been dozens of reports of drones flying too close to airports or commercial aircraft, and experts say the radio-controlled devices pose a significant threat because they could be sucked into a jet engine. Three commercial pilots encountered drones while making their final approach to JFK Airport in New York. Hobbyists are allowed to use drones for recreational flights but the tiny aircraft are not permitted within five miles of airports and they must be kept far from planes. Ken Honig, a former high-ranking official with the Port Authority, which operates major airports in New York City and some New Jersey cities, told NBC that drone operators probably don't realise the devastating damage they could cause. He said: ‘These planes are all being approached [by drones] while the planes are landing, so they're close to the ground, which means the pilot doesn't have a whole lot of room for manoeuvring. ‘If the unmanned aerial vehicle gets too close to a plane, it could get sucked into a jet engine. The kind of damage done by a bird could be amplified by the metal parts in a UAV.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Imagine you're playing with a toy car, but instead of a car, it's a small flying machine called a drone. Drones are really popular these days, and lots of people like to use them to take cool pictures from the sky.

Recently, three different airplanes near New York's JFK Airport saw a drone flying really close to them. These planes were getting ready to land, so having a drone nearby made the pilots worried. If a drone gets too close, it could get sucked into the airplane's engine and cause a big problem. Luckily, all the airplanes landed safely, and no one was hurt.

Let's look at the problem: 2424 = 147*r + 4090 + 4655 First, find the total of the numbers on the right side of the equation, so we need to add 4090 and 4655 together: 4090 + 4655 = 8745 Now we have: 2424 = 147*r + 8745 Our goal is to find the value of r. To do that, we should get r all by itself on the right side of the equation. So we will subtract 8745 from both sides: 2424 - 8745 = 147*r This will give us: -6321 = 147*r Now to find the value of r, we just need to divide both numbers by 147: -6321 ÷ 147 = r After calculating this division, we get: r = -43 So the answer is r = -43!

If there is oxidization on the surface, you may need to place the silver in a pickle solution before soldering. Optionally, you may use 1000 grit sandpaper to make a rougher surface for joining. Prepare the flux according to instructions on the packaging, if it is not ready to use. Use a small paintbrush to apply this flux onto the silver object(s). Some people apply flux only where the solder will be present, in order to limit the amount of solder that flows to the wrong place. Others prefer to apply the flux over a larger area to minimize the risk of fire damage, but this is not recommended for beginners. Using a small amount of flux in a separate container is recommended, as repeatedly dipping a brush into the original bottle may add dirt and affect its function. Lay the two components next to each other on the soldering brick. Position them exactly as you want them to be joined, noting that they must be physically touching to be joined properly. Use a pair of tweezers to pick up a solder chip and gently place it on one end of the crack or gap to be joined. Once melted, the solder will be drawn by the heat anywhere flux was applied, so you do not need to cover the entire length of the gap. Light your torch and adjust the heat to its highest setting. Begin by holding the torch about 4 inches (10 cm) away from the joint, moving it constantly in small circles to ensure even heating of all components. Slowly move the flame closer to the joint, focusing on the metal objects near the solder, not the solder itself. When the solder reaches its melting point, it will quickly melt and be pulled onto the fluxed areas of the silver.  If one of the objects to be joined is thicker than the other, heat the thicker object from the back until the solder starts to melt, then heat the thin object briefly.  Use tweezers if necessary to hold the objects in place, but place them on the far end of the silver, away from the flame. You may need to hold down small, thin areas of the silver to provide a heat sink, preventing the thin area from melting. Let the object cool for a minute, then cool it further by dipping it into a water bath. The \\"pickle\\" solution described in the work area section is an acidic bath used to clean the jewelry after soldering. Lower the silver into this bath using copper tongs, and leave it for a few minutes to remove the flux and oxidization.

Teacher:In this task, you're given a paragraph from the research paper and your task is to generate a suitable title for the research paper based on the given paper. Under 100 words is a good title length. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes acute diarrhea and dehydration in sucking piglets and has a high mortality rate. An immunochromatography (IC) assay, known as a lateral flow test, is a simple device intended to detect the presence of target pathogens. Here, we developed an IC assay that detected PEDV antigens with 96.0% (218/227) sensitivity and 98.5% (262/266) specificity when compared with real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using FAM-labeled probes based on sequences from nucleocapsid genes. The detection limits of the real-time RT-PCR and IC assays were 1 × 10 2 and 1 × 10 3 copies, respectively. The IC assay developed herein did not detect non-specific reactions with other viral or bacterial pathogens, and the assay could be stored at 4 • C or room temperature for 15 months without affecting its efficacy. Thus, the IC assay may result in improved PED detection and control on farms, and is a viable alternative to current diagnostic tools for PEDV. Student:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, I analyzed the key elements, including the subject (Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus), the method (an immunochromatography assay), the performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, and detection limits), and the potential application (improved PED detection and control on farms).

Who will lose less strength in their muscles?  Justin and Derek are accomplished competitive weight lifters. One day, Derek suffers a severe injury to his leg. Because of this injury, Derek is forced to stop exercising for several months. Justin remains injury free and continues to work out regularly on the other hand.  Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. A:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, Derek will lose more strength in his muscles compared to Justin. The reason behind this is the principle of \\"use it or lose it,\\" which emphasizes the importance of continued exercise to maintain muscle size, strength, and efficiency. As Justin remains injury-free and continues to work out regularly, his muscles, particularly his skeletal muscles, will continue to contract against resisting forces, such as the weights lifted during his training sessions. As a result, Justin's muscles will maintain their increased size and strength due to the consistent exercise. On the other hand, Derek suffers a severe injury to his leg, forcing him to stop exercising for several months. During this period of inactivity, Derek's muscles will not be exposed to the regular resistance and effort they experienced when he was exercising. Consequently, his muscles will gradually get smaller and weaker due to the lack of use. In summary, Derek will lose more strength in his muscles because of his inability to exercise due to his injury, while Justin will maintain or even improve his muscle strength by continuing his regular workout routine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the names of the people Beatrix wants to prove wrong?, using the article: The story begins with Beatrix Potter nervously packing her portfolio and narrating that she is a London spinster, and that her ambition to become a children's author meets with wide disapproval. She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of Harold and Fruing Warne, who decide to publish her book. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However, it is revealed the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure. The only reason they agreed to publish it is because they promised their younger brother, Norman, a project. When Norman Warne visits Beatrix, they make decisions about her book regarding size, colour and price. Norman admits he has never done anything like this before but has given her book a great deal of thought. Beatrix realises what Norman's brothers have done regarding him and her, but they become determined to prove them wrong. Norman takes Beatrix to the printer, and she has her drawings reproduced and copies of her book sold. Thrilled, Beatrix and Norman visit the Warne family, where Beatrix meets the wheelchair-bound but lovely Mrs. Warne, and Norman's sister, Amelia, nicknamed \\"Millie\\". Millie has decided that she and Beatrix are going to be friends and is overjoyed that Beatrix is a spinster, as is Millie, who believes men to be nothing but bores. The family befriends Beatrix, yet Helen Potter, Beatrix's social-climbing mother, is unhappy about her daughter spending time in the company of 'tradesmen'., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The names of the people Beatrix wants to prove wrong are Harold and Fruing Warne, the Warne brothers who own the publishing house.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? To prepare homemade lox, you’ll need 1 ½ to 2 pounds (680 to 907 g) of boneless salmon fillet with the skin on. Run some cold water in the sink and rinse the fillet well. Next, examine the fillet to make sure that all of the bones have been removed.  You can purchase either \\"belly lox\\" or regular \\"lox\\" fillets. Both are salmon, but belly lox comes from the stomach region of the fish. The graining of fat in the stomach region makes belly lox the better option to use when you make lox because it is more widely spaced. This results in a final product that is more desirable and less salty. If there are any pin bones left in the salmon fillet, use a small pair of tweezers or pliers to pull them out in the same direction that they’re facing. Pin bones are more likely to occur in wild salmon than farmed salmon. Once the salmon is thoroughly rinsed, use a sharp knife to cut the fillet in half. Make sure that the pieces are as equal in size as you can get them. Add 1 cup (288 g) of kosher salt and 1 cup (200 g) of sugar to a medium bowl. Mix the ingredients together well so they’re fully blended. If you like, you can also add about ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of coarsely ground black pepper to the mixture. Place the two pieces of salmon in a shallow dish so they’re side by side. Pour an equal amount of the salt mixture over each piece, piling it right on top of the salmon. It may seem that there is a lot of excess salt mixture on the salmon, but the fish will absorb it during the curing process. After you’ve added the salt mixture to the salmon pieces, divide half a bunch of dill with the stems removed between them and add it on top of the salt. Next, place one of the salmon pieces on top of the other, being careful not to knock off the salt mixture. When the salmon pieces are sandwiched together, carefully wrap them in plastic wrap. Once the fish is secure in the plastic wrap, set it in a large plastic zipper bag. Before closing the zipper bag, be sure to push all of the air out of it first. Set the bag with the salmon down in a shallow dish. Place another heavy dish on top of the bag to weigh it down, and refrigerate the fish for 2 to 3 days. You can use any heavy item, such as a bottle of wine, to weigh down the salmon. While you’re curing the salmon, it’s important to keep it from getting soggy. Remove any liquid that’s been extracted from the salmon from the plastic bag and flip the fish over so both sides are evenly weighed down. At the two day mark, begin tasting the lox. Once it has the taste that desire, you can take it out of the curing container and unwrap it. If the lox isn’t properly cured after two days, you should leave in the container for another day. After you’ve removed the fish from the plastic wrap, rinse it well under cold water to remove any residue. Use a sharp knife to cut it thin on the bias. Make sure to leave the skin behind. You can freeze the lox if you don’t plan to eat all of it right away. Wrap it well in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer bag for storage. You should eat it within 3 to 4 months. Summary:","output":"This article teaches you how to make homemade lox using boneless salmon fillet, salt, sugar, and dill, by curing the fish in the fridge for 2-3 days before slicing and eating it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 15 October, after moderate KPA resistance, the 7th Cavalry Regiment and Charlie Company, 70th Tank Battalion captured Namchonjam city. On 17 October, they flanked rightwards, away from the principal road (to Pyongyang), to capture Hwangju. Two days later, the 1st Cavalry Division captured Pyongyang, the North's capital city, on 19 October 1950. Kim Il Sung and his government temporarily moved its capital to Sinuiju – although as UNC forces approached, the government again moved – this time to Kanggye.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The current capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, is Pyongyang. While the context provided discusses events from the Korean War in 1950, during which the North Korean capital temporarily shifted locations multiple times, Pyongyang has remained the primary and recognized capital city of North Korea since that time. In October 1950, the United Nations Command (UNC) troops, including the United States' 1st Cavalry Division, pushed the Korean People's Army (KPA) back across the Korean Peninsula. This series of events led to the capture of Pyongyang by the UNC forces on 19 October 1950. Consequently, North Korea's leader Kim Il Sung was forced to move the capital temporarily to Sinuiju and eventually to Kanggye as UNC forces advanced further into North Korean territory. However, as the Korean War progressed and eventually reached a ceasefire agreement in 1953, North Korea regained control over its territory, including Pyongyang, which was reestablished as the nation's capital.

It helps support your foot when you engage in physical activity to reduce strain. It can also help minimize stress and inflammation. Keeping your foot stretched helps your foot loosen and heal in an elongated position so it doesn't shorten during the night. The main goal in taping your foot is to keep the foot flexed, with the toes pointing or pulled toward your head, until you feel a stretch in the bottom of your foot. Make sure you only feel a gentle stretch in your foot. You may start seeing symptoms when you feel pain under your heel or in the arch of your foot. This often occurs when you stand up in the morning or after resting your feet for an extended period of time. After some time walking, the pain decreases.  Pain may be felt after long periods of standing, physical activity, running, or sitting. Many times, the pain is felt while exercising. The pain is usually described as stabbing, but it can also be described as aching or burning. The plantar fascia bears all our weight and has been described as a sort of bowstring supporting the arch of the foot. Anything that causes increased strain on this area of the foot can cause plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis may occur when the plantar fascia tightens, shortens, or becomes inflamed.

Given the question: In a rare display of bipartisan unity during an election year, Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his comments about the ethnicity of a judge overseeing a class action suit against Trump University. Members of both parties lambasted the real estate mogul for remarks that they assert were racist. Trump said he felt U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case that charged Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the midwestern U.S. state of Indiana. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \\"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.''' Also leading the charge Monday were Trump’s two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \\"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \\"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.'' Florida Senator Marco Rubio agreed. \\"It's wrong and I hope he stops.'' But no mea culpa was forthcoming from the candidate. Trump insisted earlier Monday that Curiel could not be impartial in the legal action against him because the jurist's parents were born in Mexico and Trump wants to build a wall along the Mexican border. Republican Senator Susan Collins called Trump's comments \\"absolutely unacceptable.\\" Democratic Congressman Filemon Vela said in an open letter published Monday that Trump's \\"ignorant anti-immigrant opinions,\\" border wall rhetoric and continued attacks on a sitting federal judge \\"are just plain despicable.\\" Vela, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border, says his great-great-grandfather came to the U.S. in 1857 — well before Trump's ancestors. Vela wrote, \\"Mr. Trump you are a racist and you can take your border wall and shove it….\\" Kasich, Rubio and Collins joined other top...

The filmmakers' interpretation of the Wendigo's form is interesting, and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the Wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror, for instance - and the tree-form was actually very good. However, as a monster character it never really comes to life. We don't get much of an explanation for its behavior, and what we DO see from it doesn't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself, or any Wendigo lore I've ever read. I think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it isn't given enough to do, in the movie. When you boil this film down to its bones, what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element, instead of a movie about a monster. The cinematography is good, though a little cheesy; the filmmakers use scenery, lighting, and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well. The character of Otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable, making him the real monster in the film. It might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the Wendigo, which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend. I have heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason the Wendigo doesn't do much is that, when the monster suit was built, it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable (in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves, the performer had to walk on his toes) that it was nearly impossible to run, walk, or otherwise perform in it. Thus the many flashes of the creature standing still, and the obvious sped-up footage of it running. I stress that these reports are uncomfirmed. Choose your answer.

(CNN)  -- Novak Djokovic extended his winning run to 23 matches with a 6-3 6-1 victory over American Mardy Fish to reach the final of the Masters 1000 tournament in Miami Friday. The Australian Open champion will play either Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer, who were playing in the night session, in Sunday's final. The Serbian beat world number one Nadal to claim the prestigious Indian Wells crown last month. The world number two saved two break points as Fish made a strong start, but after a brief rain delay it was Djokovic who seized the initiative with an immediate break of service. \\"I told Mardy at the end I got saved by the rain,\\" Djokovic told the official ATP Tour website. \\"It really seemed like that. After I went back to the locker room I had 45 minutes to get it together and I felt much better after I came back to the court.\\" 14th seed Fish, who has succeeded Andy Roddick as the highest placed American in the rankings, was unable to respond as Djokovic closed out the opening set. He was broken immediately at the start of the second set and a further break in the fifth game left him no way back. The 23-year-old Djokovic eventually closed out victory in just 90 minutes as he continued his superlative start to 2011. In other tennis news Friday, Britain's Andy Murray has confirmed that doubles specialist Ross Hutchins will be his new coach from the Barcelona Open later this month.

Given the question: A recently study found people's lives are made shorter in North China. It is showed the life expectancy  had been cut down by 5.5 years there. Researchers think that the heavy air pollution in China should be to blame . It's really the truth. Our government has already done something. However, it doesn't seem to work so well. \\"Air pollution in China is doing harm to people's health. The harm is much more serious than we can imagine,\\" said Chen Yuyu of Beijing University, one of researchers of this study. Dirty air brings serious problems in North China. In January this year, the air pollution was worse than that in other places. That was caused by rising temperature and waste gas  from coal heating. Chinese government should strongly fight against air pollution. They should think of more proper ways to deal with the problem. People should be encouraged to take buses, ride bicycles or walk, instead of driving cars. The factories that pollute heavily should be closed. \\"We need to improve our environment, although it might be expensive. Protecting our environment means protecting ourselves,\\" Li Hongbin, another researcher of the study said. Which of the following is Li Hongbin's idea? A) The life expectancy had been cut by 5.5 years. B) Chinese government should close some factories that pollute heavily. C) People need to make pollution less, although it might cost a lot. D) The air problem brings us serious problems. The answer is:","output":"C) People need to make pollution less, although it might cost a lot. Li Hongbin, one of the researchers in the study, emphasizes the importance of improving the environment despite the potential expenses involved. Air pollution has been an ongoing issue in China, particularly in the northern regions, significantly impacting people's health and cutting down life expectancy by 5.5 years. He believes that protecting the environment is synonymous with protecting ourselves. Though the government has already taken measures to combat air pollution, they have not been as effective as desired. Chen Yuyu, another researcher, states that the harm caused by the air pollution is much more serious than previously thought. A comprehensive strategy to fight against air pollution is essential for the Chinese government. They should develop more efficient and targeted solutions to address the problem. Promoting environmentally friendly methods of transportation, such as buses, bicycles, and walking instead of driving, would help reduce emissions from cars. Additionally, shutting down heavily polluting factories could significantly decrease the levels of air pollution. In conclusion, Li Hongbin's idea is centered on making concerted efforts to reduce pollution, even if it may be costly. Both he and his fellow researcher Chen Yuyu highlight the severity of air pollution's impact on public health in North China and the urgent need for more effective strategies. It is important for the Chinese government and its citizens to prioritize the environment and work together to improve the air quality for a healthier future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1385, the castle of Ricklingen, where the Mandelslohs resided, was besieged. When a catapult threw a heavy rock at the troops of Duke Albert, he was hit, and died on 28 June 1385. In the wake of his death, Elector Wenceslas appointed Bernard, his brother-in-law, as co-regent involved him in the government. But his younger brother Henry did not agree with this ruling, and after vain attempts to reach an agreement, the fight flared up again in the spring of 1388. Elector Wenceslas had to assemble an army without the help of Bernard, supported by the town of Lüneburg. From Winsen an der Aller, he wanted to attack Celle, which was held by Henry and his mother. During the preparations, however, Elector Wenceslas fell seriously ill and died shortly thereafter. According to legend, he was poisoned.

John is a biologist, who studies animal species of tundra biome. He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B.  Which process would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, process A or process B? The answer to this question is:","output":"To determine the answer to this question, we need to analyze the hormonal responses and effects of both process A and process B. Let's examine each process one by one: Process A: Hormones secreted from the adrenal cortex include cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenal androgens. Cortisol helps regulate metabolism by increasing blood sugar levels and playing a role in decreasing inflammation. Aldosterone helps regulate blood pressure by controlling the balance of salt and water in the body. Adrenal androgens are sex hormones.  Process B: Hormones secreted from the adrenal medulla include adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). These hormones are responsible for the \\"fight or flight\\" response in animals. Adrenaline increases heart rate, dilates blood vessels, and increases blood flow to the muscles, supplying them with more oxygen and glucose. Noradrenaline increases blood pressure and constricts blood vessels in non-essential areas of the body, directing more blood flow to vital organs and muscles. Based on this analysis, it is clear that process B, which involves the secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands' medulla, would cause more oxygen and glucose to be delivered to the muscles. This is because adrenaline and noradrenaline, the hormones secreted in process B, are responsible for increasing blood flow and oxygen supply to the muscles as part of the \\"fight or flight\\" response.

Now, I will form a sentence that includes all these words while maintaining a logical connection: \\"The builder, proud of his latest creation, chose to depict the birth of his child through a beautiful stained glass window, carefully crafting each vibrant stain to capture the emotion of the moment.\\" In this sentence: - The builder connects with the act of constructing something artful. - The birth of a child is the central theme of the depicted scene. - Depict relates to representing the birth in the stained glass window. - Stain refers to the colors used in the stained glass to create the image. - Window is the canvas on which the builder creates the representation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A billionaire Russian businessman, Uri Omovich (Karel Roden), plans a crooked land deal, and London's crooks all want a piece of it. Other key players include the underhand accountant Stella (Thandie Newton) and ambitious small-time crook One-Two (Gerard Butler) leading a group called the \\"Wild Bunch\\" which includes Mumbles (Idris Elba) and Handsome Bob (Tom Hardy). Lenny charges Uri â¬7,000,000 for the crooked deal; Uri has his accountant Stella find funds. Uri lends his lucky painting to Lenny as a sign of friendship. Stella, however, double-crosses Uri and tips off the Wild Bunch to steal the money, while the painting is stolen from Lenny's wall by his junkie rocker stepson Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell), who disappears. Lenny and Archy coerce his former managers Mickey (Chris \\"Ludacris\\" Bridges) and Roman (Jeremy Piven) into tracking down Johnny. Handsome Bob also gets close to a lawyer who has information on a prevalent undercover informer in their criminal circle. After Uri's money is stolen by the Wild Bunch a second time, his assistant Victor begins to suspect that it is Lenny who has been stealing the money and purposely keeping Uri's painting from him to resell it. This theory enrages Uri, who lures Lenny to a private golf game in order to break his leg, warning him to return his painting without delay. Cookie (Matt King) happens to buy the painting from some crackheads who had just stolen it from Johnny's hideout. Cookie then gives the painting to One-Two who, in turn, offers the painting to Stella (after a sexual encounter) as a token of appreciation. After Stella leaves his flat, One-Two is surprised by Uri's henchmen but is rescued, and then kidnapped, by Archy and his goons who had come looking for Uri's money.

Although the statement initially acknowledges that the subject has some amount of fun, the overall sentiment expressed tends to focus on the shortcomings and problems present in the subject, which can be analyzed with a closer look at the specific language used. First, the phrase starts with a comparison, stating that the subject has \\"about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor.\\" The comparison is somewhat positive, as it implies that the subject retains a portion of the fun present in the original. However, describing that the subject has less fun than its predecessor introduces negativity by setting a standard that the subject fails to reach. Following this, the phrase describes the subject as \\"rushed\\" and \\"slapdash,\\" which generally carry negative connotations. These terms suggest that not enough time or effort was put into creating the subject, leading to a product or experience that may be incomplete, poorly thought-out, or lacking in quality. The phrase further emphasizes the lack of thought put into the subject by characterizing it as a \\"sequel-for-the-sake-of-a-sequel.\\" This implies that the subject's creators may have been more focused on the financial benefits of producing a follow-up rather than trying to create a meaningful, fresh, and engaging experience. Such a sentiment can come across as a disappointment, especially to fans of the original who may have had high expectations. Finally, the phrase critiques the subject's story and creativity by stating it has \\"less than half the plot and ingenuity.\\" This comparison implies that the subject fails to build upon or even capture a significant portion of the elements that made the original interesting. Overall, this phrase suggests that the subject is a disappointing follow-up to its predecessor. In conclusion, the phrase contains a generally negative sentiment due to the focus on the subject's shortcomings, the negative language used, and the disappointment evoked in the reader. Although there is a minor positive aspect recognizing that the subject has some measure of fun, this aspect is overshadowed by the numerous negative points."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Given the following context:  Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Kim Jong-un bans SARCASM after North Koreans praise him ironically saying 'It's all America's fault' Crackdown on indirect criticism hidden behind humour, now classed as 'hostile actions' NORTH Korea’s crackpot dictator Kim Jong-un has banned his people from using sarcasm in their everyday conversations in a fresh crackdown on criticism of his leadership. Mass meetings organised by government officials have been used to issue a chilling warning that ironic statements “will not be forgiven”. Oppressed and starving workers have been told satire directed towards the regime or indirect criticism hidden behind humour will be seen as “hostile actions”. Among the phrases outlawed by Kim are ‘This is all America’s fault’ – a jibe at the paranoid regime’s obsession with blaming the USA for its own failings. A source in the northern Jagang province near the Chinese border told Radio Free Asia: “One state security official personally organised a meeting to alert local residents to potential ‘hostile actions’ by internal rebellious elements. “The main point of the lecture was ‘keep your mouths shut’.” The same message was delivered in a meeting held in neighbouring Yanggang province on August 28, a source there said. The official leading the meeting warned those present against being “dragged into internal hostile behaviour”. The source added: “This habit of the central authorities of blaming the wrong country when a problem’s cause obviously lies elsewhere has led citizens to mock the party.” Another blacklisted expression is “A fool who cannot see the outside world”. Portly Kim has launched a crackdown on anyone directing irony at his regime The phrase has been used widely by government workers in the capital Pyongyang who were surprised Kim Jong-un failed to appear at commemorations held in Russia and China to mark the end of the Second World War. Expressions of public discontent with the brutal regime have become more common in the tightly controlled state this year. Graffiti mocking production slogans appeared at a construction site in Pyongyang, while more scandalous graffiti personally attacking Kim has been seen in areas near China. We pay for your stories!

Q:I have a new situation: Dan, a renowned pedologist, visited two farms near his home town. Grape farm had depleted soils and a low crop production, while Fruit farm, having parcels with depleted soils in the past, established an agroforestry system starting a decade ago which helped stabilize soil and increase production.  But I can use this background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  What is an answer for this question: Which farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods? A:","output":"To answer the question: Grape farm didn't obtain cleaner water as a result of their farming methods. Step 1: Identify key information from the situation and the background. - Grape farm has depleted soils and low crop production. - Fruit farm established an agroforestry system that helped stabilize soil and increase production. - Agroforestry systems can provide cleaner water by reducing nutrient and soil surface runoff. Step 2: Compare the two farms' farming methods. - Grape farm has not implemented any measures to protect and restore its depleted soils. - Fruit farm has implemented an agroforestry system, which is known to reduce soil erosion and improve water quality. Step 3: Determine which farm did not obtain cleaner water based on their farming methods. - Since Grape farm did not implement any measures to improve soil quality and reduce erosion, it is less likely to have obtained cleaner water as a result of their farming methods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  Horse stable  for the following movie plot:  The story opens as a woman with dark hair, seen only from behind, carries a suitcase along a train platform. The yellow purse tucked under her arm is presented at such an angle that it is suggestive of female genitalia.In the next scene, outraged business owner Sidney Strutt (Martin Gabel) rants to a pair of detectives that he was \\"cleaned out\\" by a female employee named Marion Holland whom he obviously hired for her looks despite her lack of professional references. A client of Strutt's, Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), overhears the conversation and says that he remembers this woman, wryly referring to her as \\"the brunette with the legs.\\"The woman, real name Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedren) is a compulsive thief, and has made off with almost 10,000 stashed in the yellow purse. She changes her appearance, going from brunette to blonde, and flees with the cash, journeying south to a town in Virginia where she keeps her beloved horse, Forio, stabled. She then visits her mother Bernice (Louise Latham) in Baltimore. She lavishes her mother with expensive gifts in an attempt to impress her and win her love, but the woman is cold and distant with Marnie, showing much more maternal affection towards a little neighbor girl named Jessie whom she babysits. Marnie's intense jealousy of Jessie seems inappropriate for a grown woman to express, and along with her panic over a bouquet of red gladiolas and her mother's insistence that \\"decent\\" women don't need men, the first hints of the dysfunction that drives Marnie to lie and steal appear.Time goes by and Marnie constructs a new identity, Mary Taylor, with the intent to run her scam again on another victim. She applies for a job at a printing company in Philadelphia owned by none other than Mark Rutland.

For example, 'A' and 'a' will both be replaced with the number 1, 'B' and 'b' will both be replaced with the number 2, and so on. Here are the steps to complete this task using the given input ['L', 'S']: 1. Create an empty list, called 'output', where you will store the converted numbers. 2. For each alphabet in the input list A, do the following:    a. Check if the input alphabets are uppercase or lowercase.    b. If it's uppercase, subtract 'A' (the first uppercase alphabet) from the alphabet and add 1. This will give you the position of the alphabet in the English alphabet.    c. If it's lowercase, subtract 'a' (the first lowercase alphabet) from the alphabet and add 1. This will give you the position of the alphabet in the English alphabet.    d. Append the resulting number to the 'output' list. 3. Once you have processed all the alphabets in the input list, the 'output' list will contain the required numbers. Applying these steps to the given input ['L', 'S']: Step 1: Create an empty list called 'output'. Step 2: For each alphabet in ['L', 'S']:   a. 'L' is uppercase.   b. Subtract 'A' from 'L', add 1 => 12.   c. Append 12 to the 'output' list.      a. 'S' is uppercase.   b. Subtract 'A' from 'S', add 1 => 19.   c. Append 19 to the 'output' list.

Formed in 2000, the band consists of Tommy Giles Rogers Jr. (lead vocals, keyboards), Paul Waggoner (lead guitar, backing vocals), Dustie Waring (rhythm guitar), Dan Briggs (bass, keyboards), and Blake Richardson (drums). Their debut eponymous album was released through Lifeforce Records in 2002, shifting to Victory Records for subsequent releases until their signing to Metal Blade in 2011, where Between the Buried and Me released their first extended play, The Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues that year, and its full-length follow-up The Parallax II: Future Sequence the following year. Their seventh studio album, Coma Ecliptic, was released in 2015. In August 2003, Between the Buried and Me traveled to Q Division Studios in Somerville, Massachusetts to record their second record, The Silent Circus, released in October the same year. It was later re-released in 2006 with a live DVD of the band's performance at The Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on July 17, 2005. Mark Castillo played drums on The Silent Circus, replacing Goodyear.  After the release of The Silent Circus, the band went through numerous members before the current lineup was assembled for their third album, Alaska. On drums, Mark Castillo was replaced by Jason Roe, and later by Blake Richardson. On guitar, Fletcher was replaced by Shane Blay, and later by Dustie Waring. And on bass, King was replaced by Kevin Falk, and later by Dan Briggs. This remains the current lineup.  In the summer of 2005, Between the Buried and Me released Alaska. The album released the songs \\"Selkies: The Endless Obsession\\", \\"The Primer\\", and \\"Backwards Marathon\\" as singles. In the following year, the band released their first cover album, The Anatomy Of, a collection of covers of bands that influenced Between the Buried and Me, including Metallica, King Crimson, Pantera, Faith No More, Queen, Pink Floyd, Earth Crisis, Counting Crows, and Soundgarden. In early 2006, Between the Buried and Me was on tour supporting Bleeding Through along with Every Time I Die and Haste the Day. They were also on the Ozzfest 2006 Second Stage.

Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that. Of course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours. They needed to cash that check and disappear as soon as they could. The bank put up a bit of a fuss about the check, which was one more reason Paul hated Bank of Fucking America. They always had some rule to screw a customer. But Chloe made a bunch of noise and actually jumped up and down at one point and eventually they walked out of the bank with a cashier's check. Why didn't Paul feel concern?  A. He could blackmail Greg with pictures of Evan in drag.  B. not enough information  C. Once Greg  made up his mind, it was hard to change.  D. He knew he and Chloe was just do it all over again. Answer:","output":"The main reason Paul didn't feel concern was C. Once Greg made up his mind, it was hard to change.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament.

He logically knows it is time to give up his attempts to enter piano competitions and instead accept a salaried position as a music teacher. Paul also needs to help his mother and his seriously ill father, but he decides to travel to San Francisco for an international piano competition. Doing so could cost him his job waiting for him in Chicago; nevertheless, he wants to try his luck for the last time before passing the age limit to compete.

He advances to the final round of six, which includes a brash New Yorker named Jerry DiSalvo, who only knows how to play one concerto, Michael Humphries, who rehearses in the nude, Canadian pianist, Mark Landau, who is note-perfect but emotionally moribund, and a meek Russian girl, Tatjana Baronova, whose teacher disrupts the competition by defecting to the United States.

Heidi's esteemed music teacher, Greta Vandemann, advises her to avoid letting personal matters interfere with her concentration. Heidi is also rudely rebuffed by Paul, who also wants to avoid any distraction. Despite his situation, Paul asks Heidi for a date and pours his heart out to her about his family situation. Just before the competition, she realizes how much winning means to Paul and wants to drop out. Greta, angry, later chastises Paul, blaming him for hurting Heidi's chances by exploiting her guilt over competing against him.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In America, most people don't get enough sleep. Children aged 5 to 12 are advised to sleep 10 to 11 hours every night, but most of them can't sleep that long. A study found that about 41 million American workers got less than six hours of sleep every night. Scientists worry that parents are passing their bad sleeping habits down to their children. In the study, Reut Gruber and some other scientists either added or reduced on hour of sleep for healthy children aged 7 to 11. They watched the children for five nights. They wanted to know if the amount of sleep can affect a child's behavior. Before the study began, students were asked to sleep the same amount of hours as usual. Their teachers were asked to record their behavior. After five nights of the records, scientists found that those who slept one hour less behaved worse than those who slept one hour more. Students with less sleep were more likely to feel sad and had more problems paying attention. The scientists chose to study children in their homes instead of in a laboratory, because they wanted to find out how everyday changes might affect children's behavior at school. \\"In the study, nobody became a talent, and nobody became crazy. But small changes in children can really make a big difference,\\" says Gruber. Question: Scientists worry that  _   may cause children to sleep less.

Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Which dog breed is larger, Pandikona or Schipperke? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, I will gather information about the sizes of both Pandikona and Schipperke dog breeds and compare them. Step 1: Research the sizes of Pandikona and Schipperke dog breeds. - Pandikona is an Indian dog breed primarily used for hunting. The average height for a Pandikona dog is between 20-25 inches (51-63 cm) and they typically weigh around 44-66 lbs (20-30 kg). - Schipperke is a Belgian dog breed originated as a small herding dog. The average height for a Schipperke is between 10-13 inches (25-33 cm), and they typically weigh around 10-16 lbs (4.5-7 kg). Step 2: Compare the sizes of both breeds. After gathering the information, it's clear that Pandikona dogs are larger than Schipperkes in both height and weight.

Question: What is the title of the person that the gun was illegally taken from after it was paid for?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  A series of interweaving stories tell the journey of a handgun — specifically, a .38 special revolver — as it passes from one owner to another. In all the time it passes between its various owners, it is never actually fired (aside from the one test-firing it underwent at the factory) and is never shown actually to discharge any ammunition.The opening credits run over scenes of the manufacture of the weapon. It is shipped to a gun store, where it is purchased by an older business owner whose home was recently burglarized. His wife is uncomfortable with the weapon in the house and convinces him to get rid of it. He gives it away to a security guard at his company, who pawns the gun. A young professional asks for a gun at the pawn shop. He is displeased when told there is a five-day waiting period required by law. When the pawnbroker turns to get the blank paperwork, he loads the gun with his own bullets and departs at gunpoint after paying for the pistol. At his place of employment, he is given the news that because he has the least seniority, he is being laid off. He considers shooting his supervisor before walking outside to the building's plaza during lunchtime, making mock shooting motions at random bystanders with the gun. They are alarmed and call the police. When the police arrive, he throws the gun through the open window of a parked car before he is arrested.

What is the answer: Wroxeter, the site of the Roman city of Viroconium Cornoviorum, is in which English county?","output":"Wroxeter, the site of the Roman city of Viroconium Cornoviorum, is located in the English county of Shropshire. Shropshire is a landlocked county situated in the West Midlands region of England, bordering Wales to the west, Cheshire to the north, Staffordshire to the east, and Worcestershire and Herefordshire to the south. Wroxeter, also known as \\"Viroconium\\" or \\"Uriconium,\\" was once among the largest Roman settlements in Britain, covering an area of approximately 173 acres. The Roman city of Viroconium Cornoviorum was initially built as a fortress around AD 58, during the Roman conquest of Britain, and served as a critical military base. It was home to the Legio XIV Gemina, one of the most renowned and successful Roman legions. Over time, the city grew and evolved as the fort was demilitarized, becoming an essential hub for commerce, trade, and agriculture. It was the fourth largest city in Roman Britain, with a population of around 6,000 at its peak. The city boasted various amenities, including bathhouses, a forum, a basilica, temples, and other facilities typically found in Roman cities, reflecting a sophisticated lifestyle in that era. By the late 4th and early 5th centuries, however, the Roman Empire faced numerous challenges, which eventually led to its withdrawal from Britain. Consequently, Viroconium Cornoviorum began to decline, and over the centuries, it was gradually abandoned and consumed by nature. Currently, the ruins at Wroxeter serve as a valuable archaeological site, providing valuable insights into the life and culture of Roman Britain. The site is managed by English Heritage, and visitors can explore the majestic ruins of the city and learn about its fascinating history through the visitor center and museum on-site. In conclusion, Wroxeter, home to the ruins of the Roman city of Viroconium Cornoviorum, is located in the county of Shropshire in England. The site is an important part of Britain's rich history and offers a unique perspective into the Roman presence in Britain over 2,000 years ago."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If Food and Drink, can we conclude that \\"Cuisine and beverages\\"?","output":"\\"Cuisine and beverages\\" certainly falls within the broader category of Food and Drink. It is important, however, to recognize the slight differences in nuance and focus between these two phrases. Food and Drink: The term \\"Food and Drink\\" is a general expression encompassing all edible items and potable liquids that serve as sustenance to living creatures. This category covers a vast range of concepts, from basic raw ingredients to complex dishes and various types of beverages, including water, milk, tea, coffee, soft drinks, and alcoholic beverages. It does not differentiate between various cultures, styles, or preparation techniques when discussing food and drink as sustenance for individuals. Cuisine and Beverages: The phrase \\"Cuisine and Beverages,\\" on the other hand, narrows the focus to culinary preparations and the consuming experience. \\"Cuisine\\" refers to a particular style or method of cooking, usually associated with a specific culture or region. For example, Japanese, Italian, or Mexican cuisine each have their own unique ingredients, techniques, and dishes that define their culinary identities. When discussing \\"Cuisine,\\" there is an underlying emphasis on the art of cooking, presentation, and the overall dining experience. The term \\"Beverages\\" bears a similar connotation, placing emphasis not only on the liquids consumed but also on their role in complimenting a meal, providing hydration, or offering refreshing and invigorating flavors and textures. Combining the terms \\"Cuisine and Beverages\\" implies a greater attention to detail in the cooking and presentation process, as well as an enjoyment and appreciation of various cultures, flavors, and drink pairings. In conclusion, while \\"Cuisine and Beverages\\" can be considered a subset of \\"Food and Drink,\\" the distinction lies in the focus and context of the terms. \\"Food and Drink\\" broadly covers sustenance and nourishment, whereas \\"Cuisine and Beverages\\" zeroes in on the culinary arts, cultural cooking styles, and the role of beverages in enhancing the dining experience. When discussing topics related to gastronomy, culinary arts, or cultural/regional delicacies, \\"Cuisine and Beverages\\" would be the more appropriate term to use. However, if discussing the broader subject of consumption for sustenance, hydration, and overall nourishment, \\"Food and Drink\\" would be the more accurate and fitting expression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Cleopatra VII Philopator (69  August 12, 30 BC), known to history simply as Cleopatra, was the last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt, briefly survived as pharaoh by her son Caesarion. After her reign, Egypt became a province of the recently established Roman Empire.  - Raetia (or , , also spelled Rhaetia) was a province of the Roman Empire, named after the Rhaetian (\\"Raeti\\" or \\"Rhaeti\\") people. It bordered on the west with the country of the Helvetii, on the east with Noricum, on the north with Vindelicia, on the west with Transalpine Gaul and on south with Venetia et Histria. It thus comprised the districts occupied in modern times by eastern and central Switzerland (containing the Upper Rhine and Lake Constance), southern Bavaria and the Upper Swabia, Vorarlberg, the greater part of Tirol, and part of Lombardy. Later Vindelicia (today south-eastern Wuerttemberg and south-western Bavaria) formed part of Raetia. The northern border of Raetia during the times of Augustus and Tiberius was the River Danube. Later the Limes Germanicus marked the northern boundary, stretching for 166 km north of the Danube. Raetia linked to Italy across the Alps over the Reschen Pass, by the Via Claudia Augusta. The Romansh people living in Southeast Switzerland are believed to be direct descendants of the Raetians. However, the exact lineage of the Romansh (or Romansch) people remains incomplete.  - Magnus Maximus (ca. 335  August 28, 388) was Western Roman Emperor from 383 to 388.  - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\".  - Aquileia ( Venetian: Aquieja/Aquiegia, ) is an ancient Roman city in Italy, at the head of the Adriatic at the edge of the lagoons, about from the sea, on the river Natiso (modern Natisone), the course of which has changed somewhat since Roman times. Today, the city is small (about 3,500 inhabitants), but it was large and prominent in Antiquity as one of the world's largest cities with a population of 100,000 in the 2nd century AD. and is one of the main archeological sites of Northern Italy.  - The Cimbri were an ancient people, either Germanic or Celtic who, together with the Teutones and the Ambrones, fought the Roman Republic between 113 and 101 BC. The Cimbri were initially successful, particularly at the Battle of Arausio, in which a large Roman army was routed, after which they raided large areas in Gaul and Hispania. In 101 BC, during an attempted invasion of Italy, the Cimbri were decisively defeated by Gaius Marius, and their king, Boiorix, was killed. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling Gladiators in the Third Servile War.  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - Theodosius I (11 January 347  17 January 395), also known as Theodosius the Great, was Roman Emperor from AD 379 to AD 395. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire. On accepting his elevation, he campaigned against Goths and other barbarians who had invaded the empire. He failed to kill, expel, or entirely subjugate them, and after the Gothic War, they established a homeland south of the Danube, in Illyricum, within the empire's borders. He fought two destructive civil wars, in which he defeated the usurpers Magnus Maximus and Eugenius at great cost to the power of the empire.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.  - Augustus (23 September 63 BC  19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.  - Flavius Eugenius (died 6 September 394) was a usurper in the Western Roman Empire (392394) against Emperor Theodosius I. Though himself a Christian, he was the last Emperor to support Roman polytheism.  - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the  Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.  The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about .  - Marcomer ( Marcomeres , Marchomer , Marchomir ) was a Frankish leader ( dux ) in the late 4th century who invaded the Roman Empire in the year 388 , when the usurper and leader of the whole of Roman Gaul , Magnus Maximus was surrounded in Aquileia by Theodosius I. The invasion is documented by Gregory of Tours who cited the now lost work of Sulpicius Alexander . According to this account Marcomer , Sunno and Genobaud invaded the Roman provinces Germania and Belgia in Gaul . They broke through the lines , killed many people , destroyed the most fruitful lands and made the city Cologne panic . After this raid , the main body of the Franks moved back over the Rhine with their booty . Some of the Franks remained in the Belgian woods . When the Roman generals Magnus Maximus , Nanninus and Quintinus heard the news in Trier , they attacked those remaining Frankish forces and killed many of them . After this engagement Quintinus crossed the Rhine to punish the Franks in their own country , however his army was surrounded and beaten . Some Roman soldiers drowned in the marshes , others were killed by Franks , few made it back to their Empire . Nanninus and Quintinus were replaced by Charietto and Syrus , who were again confronted by an attack of unidentified Franks . Later , after the fall of Magnus Maximus , Marcomer and Sunno held a short meeting about the recent attacks with the Frank Arbogastes , who was a general ( magister militum ) in the Roman army . The Franks delivered hostages as usual , and Arbogastes returned to his winter quarters in Trier . A couple of years later when Arbogastes had seized power and the West Roman army was nearly completely in the hands of Frankish mercenaries , he crossed the Rhine with a Roman army into Germania , because he hated his own kin . Marcomer was seen as leader with Chatti and Ampsivarii but the two did not engage . Later we hear from the poet Claudian that Marcomer was arrested by Romans and banned to a villa in Tuscany . His brother Sunno crossed the Rhine and tried to...  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.

With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Noricum is the Latin name for a Celtic kingdom, or federation of tribes, that included most of modern Austria and part of Slovenia. In the first century AD, it became a province of the Roman Empire. Its borders were the Danube to the north, \\"Raetia\\" and \\"Vindelicia\\" to the west, Pannonia to the east and southeast, and \\"Italia\\" (\\"Venetia et Histria\\") to the south. The kingdom was founded around 400 BC, and had its capital at the royal residence at Virunum on the Magdalensberg.  - The Battle of Actium was the decisive confrontation of the Final War of the Roman Republic, a naval engagement between Octavian and the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra on 2 September 31 BC, on the Ionian Sea near the promontory of Actium, in the Roman province of Epirus Vetus in Greece. Octavian's fleet was commanded by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, while Antony's fleet was supported by the power of Queen Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt.  - The Roman Senate was a political institution in ancient Rome. It was one of the most enduring institutions in Roman history, being established in the first days of the city (traditionally founded in 753 BC). It survived the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC, the fall of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC, the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, and the barbarian rule of Rome in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries.  - Northern Italy is a cultural and geographical region, without any administrative purpose, used to indicate the northern part of the Italian state, also informally referred as \\"Il Nord\\", \\"Settentrione\\" or \\"Alta Italia\\". It consists of 8 regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. According to the 2011 census, its population was 27,213,372. For statistic purposes, the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT) uses the term Northwest Italy and Northeast Italy for identifying two of the five statistical regions in its reporting. These same subdivisions are used to demarcate first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\\"NUTS 1 regions\\") within the European Union, and the Italian constituencies for the European Parliament.  - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC  15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.  - The La Tène culture was a European Iron Age culture named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland, where thousands of objects had been deposited in the lake, as was discovered after the water level dropped in 1857. La Tène is the type site and the term archaeologists use for the later period of the culture and art of the ancient Celts, a term that is firmly entrenched in the popular understanding, but presents numerous problems for historians and archaeologists. The culture became very widespread, and presents a wide variety of local differences. It is often distinguished from earlier and neighbouring cultures mainly by the La Tène style of Celtic art, characterized by curving \\"swirly\\" decoration, especially of metalwork.  - Marcus Antonius (Latin: ; January 14, August 1, 30 BC), commonly known in English as Mark or Marc Antony, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic from an oligarchy into the autocratic Roman Empire.  - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.

Beyonce Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine \\"Tina\\" Knowles (nee Beyince), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager. Beyonce's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name. Beyonce's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former back up dancer for Destiny's Child. Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \\"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\\". Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \\"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\\". Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyonce's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto. Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \\"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\\"  Beyonce's music is generally R&B, but she also incorporates pop, soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyonce's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases. While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyonce recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyonce was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.  She has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Destiny's Child and her solo efforts. Her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \\"Independent Women\\" and \\"Survivor\\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \\"Cater 2 U\\". Beyonce has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself, but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them with producers.  In 2001, she became the first black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards. Beyonce was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs (\\"Irreplaceable\\", \\"Grillz\\" and \\"Check on It\\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine song-writing credits on number-one singles. (The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song \\"I Was Here\\" for 4.) In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyonce at number 17 on their list of the \\"Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters\\", for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as \\"jumps\\" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of control flow). Now answer this question: Loops are defined as what?","output":"Loops are defined as a programming construct that enables a sequence of instructions to be executed repeatedly by a computer. They facilitate efficient management of repetitive tasks in a program, allowing for concise and organized code. Loops are an essential aspect of control flow in computer programming and serve as a powerful means to easily handle repetitive operations or complex data structures. There are two primary types of loops: For loops and While loops.  1. For loops: These loops are utilized when a programmer knows the exact number of times a certain block of code needs to be executed. For loops consist of an initialization statement, a condition or loop-continuation test, and an iteration statement. The initialization statement assigns an initial value to a control variable, while the condition tests whether the control variable meets a specific criteria to continue loop execution. The iteration statement updates the control variable after each cycle. Example of a for loop in C programming language: \`\`\` for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {     printf(\\"Loop iteration %dn\\", i); } \`\`\` 2. While loops: These loops are employed when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, and the loop continues until a specified condition is met. While loops consist of a single loop-continuation test, which is evaluated before each cycle of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop runs; otherwise, it terminates. Example of a while loop in C programming language: \`\`\` int i = 0; while(i < 5) {     printf(\\"Loop iteration %dn\\", i);     i++; } \`\`\` Loops play a crucial role in managing and processing data, such as iterating through elements of an array or traversing data structures like linked lists and trees. They also enable programmers to control the flow of their programs elegantly, and without them, many tasks would become overly complicated and inefficient to execute. Loops are a fundamental building block in virtually every computer programming language, underscoring their importance in the development of efficient and effective software solutions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Besides my Lord Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, who for family reasons had kindly promised his protection and patronage to Colonel Esmond, he had other great friends in power now, both able and willing to assist him, and he might, with such allies, look forward to as fortunate advancement in civil life at home as he had got rapid promotion abroad. His Grace was magnanimous enough to offer to take Mr. Esmond as secretary on his Paris embassy, but no doubt he intended that proposal should be rejected; at any rate, Esmond could not bear the thoughts of attending his mistress farther than the church-door after her marriage, and so declined that offer which his generous rival made him.  Other gentlemen in power were liberal at least of compliments and promises to Colonel Esmond. Mr. Harley, now become my Lord Oxford and Mortimer, and installed Knight of the Garter on the same day as his Grace of Hamilton had received the same honor, sent to the Colonel to say that a seat in Parliament should be at his disposal presently, and Mr. St. John held out many flattering hopes of advancement to the Colonel when he should enter the House. Esmond's friends were all successful, and the most successful and triumphant of all was his dear old commander, General Webb, who was now appointed Lieutenant-General of the Land Forces, and received with particular honor by the Ministry, by the Queen, and the people out of doors, who huzza'd the brave chief when they used to see him in his chariot going to the House or to the Drawing-room, or hobbling on foot to his coach from St. Stephen's upon his glorious old crutch and stick, and cheered him as loud as they had ever done Marlborough.  Answer the following questions: 1. Where do you think this takes place? 2. Did Colonel Esmond have friends in high places? 3. Who promised to protect Esmond? 4. What position was Esmond offered? 5. Where would that have taken place? 6. Was His Grace certain Esmond would accept the offer? 7. Why did Esmond not accept?","output":"1. Although the exact location is not mentioned in the text, it seems to take place in England during a historical period, most likely during the early 18th century, considering the presence of famous historical figures like Lord Oxford and Mortimer (Robert Harley) and the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon. 2. Yes, Colonel Esmond had friends in high places, such as the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, Lord Oxford and Mortimer (Robert Harley), and Mr. St. John, who were all in important positions of power and offered him support and opportunities for advancement. 3. The Duke of Hamilton and Brandon promised to protect and provide patronage to Colonel Esmond for family reasons. 4. Esmond was offered the position of secretary on the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon's Paris embassy. 5. The position would have taken place in Paris, France, where the Duke was serving as an ambassador. 6. The text implies that the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon might not have been certain that Esmond would accept the offer. It says, \\"His Grace was magnanimous enough to offer\\" the position, but also mentions that \\"no doubt he intended that proposal should be rejected.\\" This suggests that the Duke might have anticipated Esmond would not accept the offer but still graciously extended the opportunity to him. 7. Esmond did not accept the offer because he could not bear the idea of attending to his mistress after her marriage to the Duke of Hamilton, which would have been part of his responsibilities as the secretary in the Paris Embassy. It appears that Esmond's emotional connection to his mistress influenced his decision not to take up this role."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Before he has any chance to escape, a native Thai tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, Luhanà, is told that the group has captured a large fish-man.

Answer: Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections \\"balancing.\\" Question: what are corporation balance Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer provided is correct. A corporation balance sheet is a financial statement that displays the financial position of a corporation at a specific point in time. It consists of two main sections: assets and liabilities & net worth (shareholders' equity). The balance sheet follows the fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity Assets include items such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and investments owned by the corporation. These assets can be used to generate revenues and are categorized into current assets (short-term assets expected to be converted to cash within a year) and non-current assets (long-term assets). Liabilities include obligations the corporation owes, such as loans, accounts payable, and various other long-term liabilities. These liabilities are sorted into current liabilities (short-term obligations due within a year) and non-current liabilities (long-term obligations due beyond one year). Shareholders' Equity (Net Worth) represents the residual interest or ownership in the corporation after deducting liabilities from assets. It includes common stock, retained earnings, and other components related to the ownership interest of the shareholders. The balance sheet is said to \\"balance\\" as the total value of assets must be equal to the combined value of liabilities and shareholders' equity. This financial statement is essential for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders as it provides an overview of a corporation's financial health and enables them to analyze its liquidity, solvency, and overall financial stability."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given commands (in terms of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table.

With no further explanation, a sadistic madman degrades, tortures and mutilates them. Initially, he punctures Kazuo's belly with a screwdriver and slices his tongue, then rapes both, one at a time, forcing the other to watch. Sometimes he stops the torture to provide medical assistance and cure the couple's wounds, so they can continue alive for a long period of time. This way he cuts off all their fingers, makes collars with them, pops out Kazuo's right eye, removes the girl's nipples and cuts off her right arm. As the torture progresses, it is revealed he is simply doing it for sexual stimulation, and tells the couple he wants the two to survive. He finally castrates Kazuo, claiming he has found all the sexual relief he needs, so no longer needs the couple's \\"services\\". Then the couple is moved to a room which resembles a modern and clean hospital room, where the kidnapper takes care of the couple's wounds. While it is never explicitly mentioned on the movie, it becomes gradually apparent that the man has professional medical training, refined manners, taste for classical music and good wines and dressed with expensive clothes when he is not in surgeon dress torturing the couple. At some point he even mentions he is a wealthy man, which suggests he may be a reputable surgeon, not merely a violent sadist, looking for an extreme and different way to obtain satisfaction on his lonely life; however, the couple also notes the doctor has a particular rotting smell always present behind his clean and elegant appearance.

She echoed the Bank of England which warned earlier this week of a sharp rise in household debt and car loans. Ms Reeves also pledged to question company bosses over their record on reducing the gender pay gap. The recently elected chairwoman of the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee told the BBC's Today Programme she was concerned that UK households were overextending themselves with personal debt. \\"I do worry about the growth of some of those issues we saw in the mortgage market in 2008 now rearing their heads in unsecured lending and in car purchases,\\" said Ms Reeves. \\"We've got to be forever vigilant. We're not going to have the same crisis as in 2008, but there are risks building up in the financial services sector as well as in household debt.\\" Ms Reeves's words chime with a warning from the Bank of England's Alex Brazier this week that personal loans had increased by 10% over the past year and were now at \\"dangerous\\" levels. Ms Reeves, an economist, worked in the retail banking arm of HBOS between 2006 and 2009. She became MP for Leeds West in 2010 and served in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. Under her predecessor as committee chairman, Iain Wright MP, the select committee prompted headlines over the appearances of some prominent business leaders. Most notable were its cross-examination of Sir Philip Green, interviewed about his role in the collapse of BHS, and the appearance of Sports Direct boss, Mike Ashley, after allegations surfaced over poor working conditions and under-payment at the company's Derbyshire warehouse. Ms Reeves said she thought those events were \\"really powerful and actually changed behaviour in some cases\\". She said she was keen to pursue a similar strategy and also planned to look at employment practices in the gig economy. Ms Reeves signalled her intention to get tough with companies over the difference between what they pay male and female employees. From next April firms must publish information on the ratio of pay between the genders. \\"I'd like the select committee to scrutinise that, to look at what sectors and businesses are doing well and which have some way to go,\\" she said. \\"And I am keen to call in some of those businesses to understand why some - I hope -  are getting close to parity on pay, while others are still out of step.\\" Following her election earlier this month she also indicated the committee would hold companies to account over their disability and ethnicity pay gaps.

DH and I stayed at Carefree Resort and Conference multiple times during our house-hunting expeditions, but think we ate at The Lariat only once, early on, before we discovered Carefree Station and it became our \\"go-to\\" restaurant.  Well, with CS a sad memory, we are conducting try-outs for another local place---somewhere we can get a delicious meal in nice surroundings at reasonable prices minutes from our home.    Arrived about 7 pm Saturday night and the large dining room was bustling, but a pleasant  hostess seated us within minutes at  by the french doors.  We were immediately supplied with a wine list and menus, but the hostess asked if we knew about the Saturday night prime rib special.  Prime rib---yum!  For 16.95, we got a 6 oz piece of meat, our choice of baked or mashed potatoes, and a veggie choice---asparagus, broccolini, or seasonal veggies.    Checking out the menu, funnily enough with it's cowboy name and western ambiance---The Lariat menu is heavy on fish!  Most of the appetizers and a large number of entrees features our finned friends.  Our server, when he promptly arrived, told us that they have a seafood buffet the first Friday of every month that is huge and fabulous!  I wish I could tell you all the dishes on the menu, but I didn't think to grab a photo and the menus on any website are way out of date and no page on the Carefree Resort site.  But they looked delish.  I was torn between the flounder or the halibut and DH was really thinking about a pasta dish that made him salivate.  In the end, we chose to go with the prime rib special.  Started with a field greens salad---not included in the special---choosing to share.  Happily, it arrived on separate plates---very generous and served with a white balsamic vinaigrette that was WAY too tangy for me, though DH loved it.  I requested something more mellow and our server brought me some ranch.  Obviously, all the dressings are house-made---the ranch also had more tang than say---Hidden Valley and was thinner, but it was very tasty and more appealing to me.  Greens and veggies were all very fresh.  We received a basket of bread---seeded rolls and wheat rolls.  DH liked the seeded rolls so much he requested another and they gladly brought a basketful.  I thought the bread was good but a tad chewy---I suspect maybe it got a zap in a microwave to warm it up.  DH ordered a glass of Millbrandt cab and I had a glass of Coppola Pinot Noir---we enjoyed both.   Our meals arrived.  DH had went medium rare with seasonal veggies and a loaded baked potato and I went rare and mashed with broccolini.  Both pieces of meat were served perfectly to our request.  Veggie servings were generous---we aren't talking about six daintily arranged pieces---we are talking about a mound, sauteed perfectly so they were tender and crisp and still green color.  DH's seasonal veggies was a half-bushel of zucchini and yellow squash chunks, again sauteed to the point of tender-crisp. Mashed potatoes good but ordinary.  DH's potato was piled with cheese and bacon and green onions and butter and sour cream and he was happy, but I thought it could have been warmer.  He was happy though.  Of course, we got little cups of au jus, which was tasty, but not over-salty, as it can be. I requested and was immediately brought a portion of creamy horseradish sauce.  Yum!  Well, the meat was excellent.  A touch of fat for flavor, seasoned with a lovely salty-peppery rub, cooked to order, as I mentioned earlier, and DH, who is more filet mignon than prime rib, commented it didn't have the \\"game-y\\" taste he often associates with prime rib.  (I refrained from telling him that's called \\"flavor\\", unlike those over-priced blobs of tasteless meat he usually orders!)  DH cleaned his plate---except for a couple of morsels he put aside for the four-legged Queen.  I just could not eat it all despite my best efforts. I ended up bringing a whole 'nother meal home with me.  Disappointing---not having another delicious lunch planned for Sunday---but because I would like to have tried their desserts, which I understand are very good.  Instead, I settled for a cup of coffee to finish my meal.  And I have to say---whoo-doggie!  I don't know if they have a proprietary blend or what, but that was some cup of coffee.  I definitely had to cream it up.  DH said it reminded him of the coffee in Italy.  It was really good!  If they sold it in the resort lobby, I'd buy some!  Ambiance was very nice---casually elegant.  You can tell restaurant was constructed in the 60's---it has that sense---but nicely updated.  Service was excellent.  Thank you, Sean!

You can use a countertop, spoon, or your finger to lightly tap the shell. Throw out any clams that do not close when tapped.","output":"This step is essential to ensure that all the clams you will be cooking are still alive and fresh, as dead or expired shellfish can lead to adverse health effects when consumed. Once all the opened clams have been discarded, rinse the clams thoroughly under cool running water to remove any surface dirt and debris. During this step, it's crucial to handle the clams gently to avoid cracking their shells. When rinsing the clams, consider using a soft brush or cloth to gently scrub the shells and remove any stubborn dirt, sand, or algae. This will not only make your clams more visually appealing but also minimize the amount of grit that could end up in your final dish. Next, prepare a saltwater solution to help purge the clams of any sand or grit that they may still have inside their shells. To do this, mix about 1/4 cup of salt per quart of water in a large bowl or container. Make sure to use non-iodized salt, as iodized salt can impart an undesirable flavor to the clams. The ratio of salt to water should approximate the salinity of the ocean. Allow the solution to sit for a few minutes so the salt can dissolve fully. Place the clams in the saltwater solution, ensuring they are fully submerged. If the clams are not completely submerged, add more water and salt to adjust the level. Leave the clams in the saltwater solution for at least 30 minutes, preferably up to two hours, to give them enough time to filter out and expel the unwanted sand and grit. While the clams are soaking, it's essential to avoid overcrowding the container and to keep the clams in a cool environment, ideally around 45-50 degrees Fahrenheit (7-10 degrees Celsius). Overcrowding or high temperatures can stress the clams, causing them to open their shells and potentially die. Be sure to cover the container with a damp cloth to ensure the clams remain moist throughout the soaking process. After the clams have completed their soak in the saltwater solution, remove them from the water and rinse them one last time under cool running water. At this stage, it's essential to thoroughly yet gently rinse the clams to ensure that any remaining sand or grit has been washed away. Once all the clams have been cleaned and rinsed, you are now ready to cook and enjoy your delicious clams in a variety of recipes such as pasta, chowders, or steamed with a tasty broth. By taking the time to properly clean and prepare your clams, you will significantly improve the taste and texture of your clam-based dishes while enjoying them in a safe and healthy manner."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   When fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, the added nutrients cause excessive growth of algae. This is called an algal bloom. You can see one in Figure below . The algae out-compete other water organisms. They may make the water unfit for human consumption or recreation.   Q: When fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, the added nutrients cause excessive growth referred to as what, which can render the water unfit for human consumption or recreation?   A: Answer:","output":"When fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, the added nutrients cause excessive growth referred to as an algal bloom, which can render the water unfit for human consumption or recreation.  An algal bloom occurs when the nutrient levels in the water, such as nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers, become abnormally high. This leads to a rapid increase in the population of algae - single-celled photosynthetic organisms - in the water body. The algae can multiply and spread rapidly, leading to a thick, visible layer covering the surface of the water. This can lead to various negative consequences for the ecosystem, such as reduced light penetration, oxygen depletion, and the release of harmful substances. The proliferation of algae during an algal bloom can out-compete other water organisms for resources such as light and nutrients, potentially leading to a decline in their numbers. This may cause imbalances in the aquatic ecosystem and affect the food web in these water bodies. Algal blooms can make water unsuitable for human consumption due to the presence of harmful toxins produced by some species of algae. These toxins can contaminate drinking water sources, posing health risks for humans, such as gastrointestinal, neurological, and respiratory issues. Additionally, the high concentration of algae can lead to unpleasant odors and tastes in the water, further degrading its quality. Recreational activities in the water, such as swimming, boating, and fishing, can be negatively impacted due to an algal bloom. The dense layer of algae on the water's surface can be visually unappealing and may deter people from engaging in recreational activities. Additionally, there is a risk of exposure to harmful algal toxins, leading to health concerns such as skin irritation and respiratory problems. In conclusion, when fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, the added nutrients can cause excessive growth referred to as an algal bloom. This phenomenon can have severe consequences for both the aquatic ecosystem and human activities, rendering the water unfit for consumption and recreation. Effective management and monitoring of nutrient inputs in water bodies are crucial to prevent and control algal blooms and their adverse effects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Real Housewife of New York “You realize, of course, this is actually a fight club,” Helen Ellis said, as she took my coat. She spoke in a sweet Southern accent. Behind her were four members of her weekly bridge group, wearing cashmere cardigans or fitted black dresses with chunky jewelry. At 10 on a Tuesday morning, we stood in the living room of Ms. Ellis’s spacious Upper East Side apartment. She had set out a pot of tea, a tray of pastries, berries with cream. Nearby was a white Christmas tree nine feet tall, decorated entirely in insect ornaments: gold glitter dragonflies, glass ladybugs, brightly colored beetles. Each December, her tree has a different theme. She includes the previous year’s ornaments in the gift bags she gives to the 150 guests at her annual holiday party. Ms. Ellis, 45, calls herself a housewife. But that only begins to describe her. She is also a shrewd poker player who regularly competes in high-stakes tournaments, and the author of a forthcoming story collection, “American Housewife,” that focuses a dark and humorous lens on the domestic. Early reviews have been glowing; Booklist compared her to Shirley Jackson and Margaret Atwood. Ms. Atwood herself recently tweeted: “Reading ‘American Housewife’ by Helen Ellis. Pretty ferocious! (And ferocious about ‘pretty.’) Cackle-making.” Weeks before the book’s release, Ms. Atwood named it one of her favorites of the year in The Guardian. “When you meet Helen, at first you think: president of a Southern college sorority,” said one of her bridge guests, Jean McKeever. “What you find is she’s this hilarious, twisted, many-layered person.” Midway through the game, one player accidentally showed her cards. Ms. Ellis sneaked a peek. “She’s a cheater,” said her bridge partner, Erica Shultz. “It’s not cheating if someone puts a little kitten in your lap,” Ms. Ellis said. After bridge, she sat down in her bright orange den, eating a leftover croissant with jam and talking about her life. Raised in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Ms. Ellis moved to New York in 1992, on her 22nd birthday. She wanted to be a writer. “I arrived dressed in my finest, which at the time was Talbots,” she said. “The long plaid wool skirt and the turtleneck. I kept walking by that store, trying to get a job in publishing. I ended up getting a job at Talbots.” Later, she was hired as an assistant at Individual Investor magazine. While there, she applied to, and was rejected by, several M.F.A. programs. But eventually, New York University took her off the wait list. The day after she got the news, a reporter named Lex Haris walked into her office. “I had the biggest smile on my face,” Ms. Ellis said. “He thought it was for him, but really it was because I had just quit.” The misunderstanding was fortuitous. She had been trying to flirt with him for weeks. (“I would bring him People magazines, wrinkled because I had read them in the tub. I just put that image in his mind.”) They went out that night and were married six years later. Mr. Haris is now the executive editor of CNNMoney. Happily child-free, the couple has two cats, Tang Tang and Big Boy, who, true to his name, weighs 25 pounds. Throughout graduate school, Ms. Ellis worked as a temp. During her last semester, she became a secretary in the chairman’s office at Chanel, a job she would keep for a decade. A year out of school, in 1998, she sold her debut novel, “Eating the Cheshire Cat.” The book earned good reviews and solid sales. But a follow-up proved elusive. Ms. Ellis spent six years writing a second novel that was never published. She wrote another after that, which also failed to find a home. Then her husband suggested that she quit her job to write full time. “So I quit,” Ms. Ellis said. “I wrote another book. Nobody wanted to buy that one either.” She wrote a young adult book “for hire,” about teenagers who turn into cats. The sales were dismal. After that, she stopped writing altogether. Most people she met had no idea she had ever been a writer. Upon learning that she didn’t work or have children, they often asked what she did all day. “I settled into what became a very happy life,” she said. “You ask yourself, ‘What happens if I stop writing?’ First of all, nobody cares. And you put on 10 pounds. That’s all it is.” She collected paintings by emerging artists, cleaned her home religiously and hosted fund-raisers for her favorite causes, including One Story, a literary magazine edited by a friend from her N.Y.U. days, Hannah Tinti. (Along with the novelist Ann Napolitano, they have met monthly over dinner for the last 20 years. “That has been a marriage for me,” Ms. Ellis said.) She also had more time to devote to a lifelong passion: poker. Her father taught her seven-card stud when she was 6. Ms. Ellis started entering tournaments in 2008. In 2010, she played at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas for the first time. She won nearly 20,000. “Some of the most interesting people I’ve met, I’ve met through poker,” she said. One of her regular games is attended by both Broadway pit musicians and high-ranking members of law enforcement, all but one of them male. In 2011, the writer Colson Whitehead hired Ms. Ellis to be his coach at the World Series of Poker. He immortalized the experience in his book “The Noble Hustle: Poker, Beef Jerky and Death.” “In a male-dominated game, where female players often affect an Annie Oakley tomboy thing to fit in, the housewife-player was an unlikely sight,” Mr. Whitehead wrote. “The dudes flirted and condescended, and then this prim creature in a black sweater and pearls walloped them. ‘A lot of people don’t think women will bluff,’ Helen said. She was bluffing the moment she walked into the room.” Ms. Ellis was thrilled by Mr. Whitehead’s portrayal of her. “I thought at the time, ‘If this is the last that I’m published, I’m very happy letting that be what anybody thinks.’” But the urge to write remained. So she started an anonymous Twitter feed. She gave it the name American Housewife and the handle @WhatIDoAllDay. She tweeted about her life. When Ms. Ellis tweeted, “Inspired by Beyoncé, I stallion-walk to the toaster,” she was retweeted over a hundred times and earned dozens of followers. The tweet became the opening line of what would eventually be her new book. Slowly, she began to write again. Short stories this time, in the voices of housewives. The stories are addictive and full of pitch-perfect observations like, “the only thing with less character than Chardonnay is wainscoting” and “Delores was as fertile as a Duggar.” They are populated by, among others, neighbors in a co-op whose fight over decorating turns deadly; women in a book club trying to seduce a new member into carrying their babies; and a chilling series of dead doormen. Ms. Ellis placed the stories in literary journals. Last spring, her agent sent the collection to publishers. The book received multiple pre-empt offers and sold in three days to Doubleday. Fifteen years after the release of her first book, she said, “I am very aware at 45 that this is special.” She displays none of the neuroses of most writers on the cusp of a book release: “The worst-case scenario is that this fails terribly and I go back to a very nice life.” It does sound very nice: after we parted ways, she took a nap, she said, then met up with a friend to see “Hamilton.” The next day, she planned to attend a book signing by Dita Von Teese (“My spirit animal”) in the lingerie department at Bloomingdale’s. Ms. Ellis’s email signoff when making plans is a single word: “Enjoyable!” At this point, she has no interest in doing anything that isn’t. Asked if she fears that the book will offend friends or acquaintances, she said, without blinking, “I don’t care.” Then she added, “Though I’m curious to see what my doormen will think.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The text is about Helen Ellis, a 45-year-old housewife from the Upper East Side of New York, who is also a shrewd poker player and the author of a forthcoming story collection, \\"American Housewife.\\" She hosts a weekly bridge group at her apartment and frequently competes in high-stakes poker tournaments.

Her book focuses on the dark and humorous aspects of being a housewife and aims to captivate readers with her unique observations of everyday life.

They washed it out, put a band-aid on it and gave you a kiss to make it feel better – right? Sometimes, something much worse than a scraped knee can happen to some people, making them feel very scared and hurting a lot inside.  If someone hurts you in a more serious way, it's really important to tell someone you trust about it right away. This might be your mom, dad, a teacher or a police officer. In this article, we're going to talk about the steps you need to take, kind of like a special safety plan.  1. Speak Up Right Away: Just like when you hurt your knee and go to Mom or Dad, if something really scary happens, it's important you tell them right away, before you do anything else. Even if someone told you to keep it a secret, remember that secrets about hurting aren't safe or good. 2. See a Doctor: After you tell your trusted grown-up, they will take you to see a special kind of doctor. The doctor won't give you a shot or anything scary, they just want to make sure you are okay. Just like testing for a fever when you are sick, they might do special checks to make sure your body is healthy. 3. Talk to Professionals: Sometimes, when bad things happen, talking to someone who knows a lot about how to help can make you feel better. These people are like super-smart toy teddy bears who understand your feelings.  4. Share with Friends and Family: You can also talk to friends or family if you feel comfortable. It can be like when you're sad about your broken toy and you share it with your best friend. They might not be able to fix the toy, but it feels nice to have someone listen to you and comfort you.  5. Be Safe from Your Hurter: If someone has hurt you, it's really important to try and stay safe from them. This might mean staying, for example, at Grandma’s house for a while. Your trusted grown-up can help you with this. Remember, if anything bad or scary happens to you, you can always tell the grown-ups you trust. They're there to keep you safe and help take care of you, just like when you scrape your knee."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term refers to two related genres:  - Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II, with the popular action film \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\" (a.k.a. \\"Judo Saga\\"). After the war, the critically acclaimed \\"Drunken Angel\\" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. His wife Yko Yaguchi was also an actress in one of his films.  - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.  - The Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Neulovimye mstiteli\\") is a 1967 Soviet adventure film directed by Edmond Keosayan and made by Mosfilm. It is loosely based on the novel Little Red Devils by Pavel Blyakhin, under its original name. The film is an example of Ostern, set in Russian Civil War era Ukraine.  - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.  - The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers ( Russian :    , translit . Novye prikluchenya Neulovimykh ) is a 1968 Soviet action movie , a sequel of The Elusive Avengers , directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm . The movie was followed by The Crown of the Russian Empire , or Once Again the Elusive Avengers released in 1971 .  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Crown of the Russian Empire, or Once Again the Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Korona Rossiyskoy Imperii, ili Snova Neulovimye\\") is a 1971 Soviet action movie, a second sequel of \\"The Elusive Avengers\\", directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Mohamed Abdi Hassan, known as \\"Afweyne\\" or \\"Big Mouth\\", allegedly earned millions of dollars in ransom payments as the boss of one of Somalia's most successful pirate gangs.      Belgian undercover agents spent months persuading him to come to Europe to take part in a documentary, only to arrest him as he landed at Brussels airport on Saturday.      Also held was an associate, Mohamed \\"Tiiceey\\" Aden, the governor of the town of Adado in southern Somalia, who was involved in trying to broker the release of the British yachting couple, Paul and Rachel Chandler.      \\"After patiently starting a relationship of trust with Tiiceey, and through him with Afweyne, which took several months, both were prepared to participate in this (film) project,\\" said Johan Delmulle, a Belgian federal prosecutor, at a news conference on Monday.      A quietly-spoken man whose manner belies his reputation, Hassan was described in a United Nations report last year as \\"one of the most notorious and influential leaders\\" of the pirate network in Hobyo and Haradhere, two remote pirate towns along Somalia's vast east coast.      He is understood to have been given a diplomatic passport by the Somali government after publicly renouncing his old profession earlier this year, and agreeing to try to persuade other pirates to follow suit.      But his diplomatic status did not appear to impress Belgian officials, who had apparently identified him as the man behind the hijacking of a Belgian ship in 2009, for which two other Somalis have already been rrested and sentenced.      \\"All too often those persons stay out of the frame and let others carry out their dirty business,\\" said Mr Delmulle.      The prosecutor said Mr Hassan was asked via Mr Tiiceey whether he would be prepared to be an adviser on a film about piracy, portraying his life carrying out hijackings off the East African coast and making millions of dollars from ransom payments. The Belgian tactics are likely to invite criticisms that they could put genuine documentary makers at risk.      Mr Hassan's first big prize as a pirate is believed to have been the 2008 capture of the Sirius Star, a Saudi-owned supertanker that had a crew including two Britons, chief engineer Peter French, from County Durham, and second officer James Grady, from Strathclyde.      The hijacking marked the moment that the Somali piracy began to be taken as a major threat by the international community. The tanker was far bigger than anything that had been taken before, and was sailing hundreds of miles outside the pirates' usual hunting grounds, showing their ability to roam right across the Indian Ocean. It was eventually released for a £2 million ransom.      The following year, Hassan's men received a similar-sized million ransom for the Ukrainian ship MV Faina, which was carrying Russian-made tanks and weapons.      In 2012, he was reportedly offered an amnesty and a diplomatic passport by the government if he agreed to publicly repent. The deal was allegedly brokered by Somalia’s then president, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, a moderate Islamist who visited Downing Street in 2010.      Then, in January, Mr Hassan announced his retirement from buccaneering. \\"From today on I will not be involved in this gang activity,\\" he told newsmen in the town of Adado in central Somalia. \\"I have also been encouraging many of my colleagues to renounce piracy too, and they have done it.\\"      However, despite carrying around paperwork that identified himself as an \\"anti-piracy officer\\", many suspected Hassan only quit the game because piracy was getting harder as foreign ships began to carry armed guards.      His associate, Mr Aden, is a naturalised Somali-American who spent many years in Minneapolis, a city with a large Somali community.      He is credited with turning the town of Adado into one of southern Somalia's more stable spots, which also made it an attractive place for local pirates to conduct delicate hostage and ransom exchanges. As a result of that, he got to know many of the country's most notorious pirate leaders, including Mr Hassan.      At least 77 hostages are still held by Somali pirates, while some gangs have turned to land-based kidnapping and banditry instead. ||||| The alleged pirate kingpin thought he was going work in the movies.

(Associated Press)      In a sting operation worthy of Hollywood, Mohamed Abdi Hassan was lured from Somalia to Belgium with promises of work on a documentary about high-seas crime that would \\"mirror his life as a pirate,\\" federal prosecutor Johan Delmulle said Monday.      But rather than being behind the camera as an expert adviser, Abdi Hassan ended up behind bars, nabbed as he landed Saturday at Brussels airport.      \\"(He's) one of the most important and infamous kingpin pirate leaders, responsible for the hijacking of dozens of commercial vessels from 2008 to 2013,\\" Delmulle said.      Abdi Hassan _ whose nickname, Afweyne, means \\"Big Mouth\\" _ was charged with hijacking the Belgian dredger Pompei and kidnapping its nine-member crew in 2009, Delmulle said.      The Pompei's crew was released after 10 weeks in captivity when the ship's owner paid a reported 3 million ransom. Belgium caught two pirates involved in the hijacking, convicted them and sentenced them to nine and 10 years in prison.      But prosecutors still wanted the ringleaders.      \\"Too often, these people remain beyond reach while they let others do the dirty work,\\" Delmulle told reporters.      Malaysian authorities almost captured the reclusive Adbi Hassan in April 2012, but a document from the Somali transitional government let him slip back home, according to a U.N. report last year that called him \\"one of the most notorious and influential\\" leaders of a piracy ring that has netted millions in ransom.      So Belgian authorities decided to go undercover to get him, because they knew he traveled very little and that an international arrest warrant would produce no results in unstable Somalia.      They approached an accomplice known as Tiiceey, dangling a fake job as an adviser to a fake movie about piracy, Delmulle said.      The two men took the bait. Tiiceey was also arrested Saturday.      The prosecutor refused to divulge any more details of the sting. The two Somalis were to appear in court Tuesday in Brugge. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Mohamed Abdi Hassan, also known as \\"Afweyne\\" or \\"Big Mouth\\", was a boss of a successful pirate gang in Somalia.

Note the measured number.\\"","output":"Title: Master the Art of Measurements: Hold the Tape Tight and Note Introduction: When it comes to measuring, whether it be for clothing or home improvement projects, accuracy is key. A slight deviation in measurement can result in ill-fitting clothing or botched construction projects. To ensure you get the correct measurements, it is essential to follow proper techniques and guidelines. In this article, we will discuss the art of measurement and explore the importance of holding the tape tight and noting the measured number - a golden rule for accurate measurements. The Importance of Accurate Measurements: In the world of fashion, tailors and designers rely on the accuracy of their measurements to create bespoke clothing pieces that mold perfectly to the body. A typically small discrepancy could result in garments that are too tight, too loose, or simply uncomfortable. Similarly, in construction and other DIY projects, accurate measurements are the foundation of any successful venture. Whether measuring the length of a room, the width of a door, or the height of a wall, the right measurement ensures proper material allocation, waste reduction, time efficiency, and ultimately, project success. Mastering the Art of Measurements: 1. Choose the Right Tool: Before diving into any project, make sure you have the right measurement tool. A standard measuring tape is suitable for most tasks, but specialized measuring tools such as laser measures and calipers are available for more precise applications. Consider the scope of the measuring task at hand and decide which measuring instrument fits best. 2. Start your measurement: Once you've selected the appropriate measurement tool, you can begin the measuring process. It's crucial to start measuring from a fixed and well-defined point. For example, when measuring a room's length, you can start from a corner or a door frame. Be consistent and always use the same starting point, especially when taking multiple measurements, to ensure accuracy. 3. Hold the tape tight: Secure the measuring tape's hook or end on the starting point. Ensure that there are no kinks or twists along the length of the tape, as that can lead to inaccurate results. Hold the tape tight, maintaining tension along the entire length, to prevent any sagging or slippage. The tautness of the tape is essential for precise measurements. Tip: Be cautious not to stretch the tape too much; this can cause damage or potentially affect the accuracy.  4. Note the measured number: As you keep the tape tight, take note of the measured number where the tape meets the end of the object or the distance you're measuring. To read measurements easily and record them correctly, pay close attention to the scale markings and units of measurement (inches, centimeters, etc.) on your tape. Tip: Make a habit of double or even triple-checking your measurements before recording them to avoid any inaccuracies due to human error or misreading the tape. 5. Record your measurements: After noting the measured number, store this information in an easy-to-retrieve and reliable place. Some prefer writing down measurements in a notebook, while others may use digital storage systems such as a spreadsheet or smartphone app. Recording your measurements systematically helps prevent data loss and confusion during the project's execution. Conclusion: Accurate measurements are vital in various aspects of our lives, from clothing and construction to science and technology. By meticulously following the proper steps, starting from the right selection of measuring tools to holding the tape tight and noting the measured number, you can guarantee precise outcomes and avoid costly errors in your DIY projects or tailored outfits. Remember, mastery comes with practice: the more you measure, the better you'll get at it. So, the next time you find yourself holding a measuring tape, follow these guidelines, hold the tape tight, and note the measured number. Happy measuring!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Definition: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice.  After reading the above, is \\"Caves\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What is the landscape in the Illinois farmlands?\\"? Choose from: [a]. no; [b]. yes;","output":"[a]. no; \\"Caves\\" is not the correct answer because the passage described the landscape in the Illinois farmlands as flat, allowing you to see far into the distance. It also mentioned the southern part of Illinois has rolling hills, which were formed by glacial movement thousands of years ago. The passage did not mention the presence of caves in Illinois farmlands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Based on the premise \\"Paper presented at the American Educational Research Association meeting, Toronto, Canada, April 1983.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The paper covered various aspects of educational research.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the given premise, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The paper covered various aspects of educational research\\" is likely to be true. However, without examining the actual content of the paper, we cannot definitively claim its accuracy. Here are some considerations that can help strengthen the likelihood of the hypothesis's accuracy: 1. Context of the event: The paper was presented at the American Educational Research Association (AERA) meeting. AERA is a professional organization that aims to advance knowledge of education by encouraging scholarly inquiries related to education. Given the nature of the association and the event, it's logical to assume that the paper would cover topics related to educational research. 2. Location and date: The meeting took place in Toronto, Canada, in April 1983. Although the location might not play a significant role in determining the content of the paper, understanding the historical context can provide some insight. The 1980s was a decade that saw a strong focus on educational reform and research, and the paper could likely cover topics relevant to the time. 3. Relevance to the audience: Considering the target audience at the event consisted of professionals and researchers in the field of education, it is fair to assume that the paper was tailored to address their interests. It is likely that the paper's content would pertain to educational research, as these individuals would expect information relevant to their field. 4. Absence of contradictory evidence: There are no details provided that would lead us to doubt the hypothesis in question. In the absence of any contradictory information, it is reasonable to lean towards the side of the hypothesis being true. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, it is quite likely that the paper covered various aspects of educational research. However, without access to the actual content of the paper, it is impossible to confirm this hypothesis with absolute certainty. For a more accurate conclusion, reviewing the paper would be necessary to ensure that it indeed aligns with the context and expectations of the event where it was presented."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: Forbidden Planet Movie plot: In the 23rd century, Starship C-57D reaches the distant planet Altair IV to determine the fate of a 20-year-old expedition. Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), one of the expedition's scientists, contacts the Earth ship. He states no assistance is required, warning the starship not to land; he cannot guarantee their safety. Commander John Adams (Leslie Nielsen) insists on landing co-ordinates. Adams, Lieutenant Jerry Farman (Jack Kelly), and Lieutenant \\"Doc\\" Ostrow (Warren Stevens) are met by Robby the Robot, who transports them to Morbius' residence. There, Morbius claims that an unknown \\"planetary force\\" killed nearly everyone and finally vaporized their starship, the Bellerophon, as the last survivors tried to lift off. Only Morbius, his wife (who later died of natural causes) and their daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) were somehow immune. Morbius fears that the Earthmen are in danger, and (silently) that Altaira is intrigued by them. The next day, Adams finds Farman educating Altaira on kissing; furious, he dismisses Farman and berates Altaira for her naivety and revealing clothes. Altaira is frustrated, but designs a new, more conservative dress to please Adams. That night, an invisible intruder sabotages equipment aboard the starship. Adams and Ostrow go to confront Morbius the following morning. Waiting for Morbius to exit his study, Adams steps outside, only to encounter Altaira wearing her new dress. Adams sincerely apologizes and Altaira notes that she tailored her dress for him. Realizing mutual affection, they kiss.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Eleanora Fagan (April 7, 1915 - July 17, 1959), better known as Billie Holiday, was an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years. Nicknamed \\"Lady Day\\" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills, which made up for her limited range and lack of formal music education. As a young teenager, Holiday started singing in nightclubs in Harlem. She took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and the musician Clarence Holiday, her probable father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \\"Halliday\\", the birth surname of her father, but eventually changed it to \\"Holiday\\", his performing name. The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, the tenor saxophone player Kenneth Hollan. From 1929 to 1931, they were a team, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, Pod's and Jerry's on 133rd Street, and the Brooklyn Elks' Club. Benny Goodman recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including Mexico's and the Alhambra Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with Chick Webb. It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing in Fletcher Henderson's band.  Late in 1932, at the age of 17, Holiday replaced the singer Monette Moore at Covan's, a club on West 132nd Street. The producer John Hammond, who loved Moore's singing and had come to hear her, first heard Holiday there in early 1933. Hammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut, at age 18, in November 1933, with Benny Goodman. She recorded two songs: \\"Your Mother's Son-in-Law\\" and \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\", the latter being her first hit. \\"Son-in-Law\\" sold 300 copies, but \\"Riffin' the Scotch\\", released on November 11, sold 5,000 copies. Hammond was impressed by Holiday's singing style and said of her, \\"Her singing almost changed my music tastes and my musical life, because she was the first girl singer I'd come across who actually sang like an improvising jazz genius.\\" Hammond compared Holiday favorably to Armstrong and said she had a good sense of lyric content at her young age.  In 1935, Holiday had a small role as a woman abused by her lover in Duke Ellington's short Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life. In her scene, she sang \\"Saddest Tale\\".

Afghanistan's Abdullah Abdullah chides Ashraf Ghani Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan's chief executive,Â has criticised President Ashraf Ghani for failing to work collaboratively and deemedÂ him undeserving to serve the government. The televised remarks late on Thursday raised fresh questions about the stability of theÂ coalition formed in 2014 after both Ghani and Abdullah claimed victoryÂ in a presidential election and there were fears of armed clashes between their supporters. The post of chief executive was created for Abdullah, aÂ former foreign minister,Â as part of a US-brokered deal to end deadlock over the election. Inside Story - Will Afghanistanâs power sharing deal work? But he complained that he had been left out of key decisions, and depicted Ghani as arrogant and out of touch with the deteriorating situation in the country. \\"The government is paralysed and ministers do not have the chance to speak. [Ghani] provides a one-hour lecture but he should listen to the ministers for 15 minutes,\\" he said. \\"If someone does not have tolerance, they do not deserve the presidency.\\" Ghani's office was not immediately available to respond. While rivalry between the camps has been no secret, until now, Abdullah largely kept his complaints private. The government has yet to officially confirm Abdullah's position past a September deadline that had been set for doing so, or to clear up the problems that plagued the last election. Despite the criticism, Abdullah said he would not leave the unity government and said he planned to meet Ghani to discuss their differences. Abdullah's criticism comes at a particularly sensitive time, as Taliban fighters have made considerable gains in recent month in different parts of the country. Fresh fighting erupted on Thursday in Helmand after the government rushed military reinforcements to beat back Taliban fighters advancing. But US and Afghan officials insist that they will not allow another urban centre to be captured, after the Taliban briefly overran northern Kunduz city last September in their biggest victory in 15 years of war.

Fierce battles in recent days across Helmand have sent thousands of people fleeing to Lashkar Gah, spurring a humanitarian crisis as officials report food and water shortages. About 30,000 people have been displaced in Helmand in recent weeks, local officials said, with many of those fleeing to Lashkar Gah forced to abandon their lentil, maize and cotton crops during the lucrative harvest season. \\"We left everything behind in Nawa; our house, our grape and maize harvests.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Trump to meet with Obama at the White House as US wakes to shock of historic election upset Donald Trump has celebrated \\"the most beautiful and important evening\\" after he defied the world's expectations to be elected the 45th president of the United States. President Barack Obama has invited his successor to the White House later today to plan the transition to a new leader. \\"Ensuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the President identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the President-elect is the next step,\\" the White House said in a statement. The US has woken today to a reality even the senior hierarchy of the Republican party had fought, with the 70-year-old billionaire mogul with no previous experience in office now the oldest president ever elected to a first term. \\"The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will come together as never before,\\" Trump tweeted hours after he caused political embarrassment to his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the long-held favourite to win who last night stunned when she left her election party without giving a concession speech. Across town at the Hilton in New York, it was not known whether Trump would emerge to acknowledge his rival or gloat of his victory. Consistent with the unpredictable nature of his campaign, he delivered a gracious and humble speech that praised Clinton for her \\"very long and very hard\\" work. \\"We owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.\\" After one of the most bitter campaigns in history, during which Trump sought to exploit minorities and further divide the nation, the president-elect last night called for Americans to now unite and heal. \\"Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division,\\" he said. \\"I pledge to every citizen that I will be president for all Americans.\\" Donald Trump and his family and supporters watch results come in. Trump has pledged to put millions of people to work to rebuild America's inner cities and highways and said America will get along with all nations willing to get along with it. \\"We must reclaim our country's destiny,\\" he said. \\"We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things.\\" Trump thanked his family for their support and for putting up with the time he spent on the campaign trail. \\"This political stuff is nasty and it's tough,\\" he said. Trump also paid tribute to political surrogates like Rudy Giuliani, Ben Carson and Jeff Sessions, before thanking the Secret Service and the law enforcement community. He left the stage to the strains of The Rolling Stones song 'You Can't Always Get What You Want'. \\"I promise you that I will not let you down,\\" he said as he finished his address. \\"While the campaign is over, our work on this movement is just beginning. \\"You'll be so proud of your president.\\" How did he do it? Months after opinion polls failed to predict Britain's vote to leave the European Union, they have suffered perhaps their most damning blow after backing the wrong horse for the White House. An average of national opinion surveys gave Clinton a two percentage point advantage the day before the election, and the liberal New York Times gave her an 84-percent chance of winning. Bookmakers also backed Clinton, with Ireland's Paddy Power so convinced she would succeed they paid out 1 million euros (A1.4 million) three weeks before the vote to punters who had bet on Clinton. Trump's victory was that his message was embraced by a large section of America's white majority who have grown increasingly disgruntled by the scope of social and economic change in the last eight years under their first black president, Barack Obama. Many Americans from minority backgrounds expressed dismay at Trump's victory, which some saw as the result of what some observers said was a backlash against multicultural America. He swept to victory through a series of hard-fought wins in battleground states from Florida to Ohio. He amassed at least 290 electoral votes to 218 for Clinton, according to network projections. While Clinton was successful in winning Virginia, Colorado and New Mexico, states won by George W Bush in 2004, her surprise weakness in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio proved fatal. Democrats had been favoured to retake control of the Senate along with a Clinton win, but they fell short. Trump's victory as well as the retention of Senate control will allow Republicans to fill the long-vacant seat on the Supreme Court. Clinton's defeat comes as a body-blow, not just for her long-held ambitions to be president, but because of a campaign pledge from Trump to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her if elected.

Can I easily learn a piano at a later point if I start learning music with a keyboard initially? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"To answer the first question: 1. Assess the difficulty level: Learning the piano or keyboard can be challenging yet rewarding, depending on factors such as the individual's dedication, commitment, and passion for music. If the person is a beginner, they might find it difficult initially, but constant practice will help them progress and improve their skills. 2. Consider factors influencing difficulty: Factors like previous musical knowledge, time commitment, and quality of learning resources also contribute to the difficulty of learning these instruments. 3. Personalize the answer: Ultimately, the difficulty in learning the piano or keyboard varies from person to person, as we all have different learning capacities and preferences. With regular practice, perseverance, and proper guidance, one can overcome the initial challenges and become proficient at playing these instruments. To answer the second question: 1. Assess the transferability of skills: Learning the keyboard as a foundation can be beneficial when transitioning to the piano, as many skills like reading music, understanding rhythm, and finger coordination can be easily transferred between the two instruments. 2. Consider differences between instruments: Although there are similarities, the main differences between the keyboard and piano lie in touch sensitivity, weighted keys, and overall sound. A proper understanding of these differences will be necessary when transitioning from the keyboard to the piano. 3. Provide encouragement: Yes, it is entirely possible to learn the piano at a later point if you start with the keyboard, but it will still require dedication and practice to adapt to the nuances of playing the piano. Lastly, I want to clarify that these two questions are not paraphrases of each other; they ask different things. The first question inquires about the difficulty of learning the piano or keyboard, while the second question asks if there will be ease in learning the piano if the user starts with a keyboard initially. Although they are related questions, they address distinct aspects of learning these instruments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Close to 20 inches of snow piled up at the nation's capital as a blizzard pounded mid-Atlantic states Saturday, cutting power to hundreds of thousands in the region in what the president referred to as \\"Snowmaggedon.\\" Snow was falling from southern Indiana eastward to New York City, Washington, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the New Jersey coast. President Obama kept to his busy Washington schedule amid the swirling flakes, and ditched \\"the Beast\\" -- his souped-up Cadillac limousine -- for an armored, four-wheel drive Chevy Suburban capable of trudging through the several inches of snow. Despite plowing and shoveling, the continuous snow made for a slippery White House driveway. Before the 15-vehicle presidential motorcade pulled out of the driveway headed to the Capital Hilton for Obama's speech to democrats, one of the emergency vehicles lost traction and slid into an SUV. No one was in the car at the time. Flights canceled, highway crews mobilized. About 19.5 inches of snow fell at American University in Washington over two days, and was on track to possibly break a record. The capital received 28 inches of snow in the \\"Knickerbocker Storm\\" of January 27-28, 1922. The blizzard has left hundreds of thousands of customers from Virginia to Pennsylvania without power, utility companies said. As of 12 p.m., Dominion Virginia Power had restored electricity to 101,000 of 207,000 customers who were without power Saturday morning, the company said. In Maryland and Washington, more than 104,000 Pepco customers were in the dark, the utility company said. The majority, or 81,324, live in Montgomery County, Maryland, and 9,587 live in Washington, according to Pepco. In Philadelphia, a reported 26.7 inches had fallen at the airport by 1 p.m., the National Weather Service said. \\"We are getting absolutely clobbered this morning with snow,\\" said Steven Steingard, a lawyer who lives in suburban Philadelphia. \\"We have about a foot already and they say it will continue for 10 to 12 hours more.\\" The storm also may produce a record snowfall for Baltimore, which has 21 inches of snow so far, according to the National Weather Service. Virginia snowman is taller than a house. In College Park, Maryland, snow-laden power lines drooped onto branches, causing power failures. One city resident, Ben Hampton, told CNN he could could hear electrical transformers popping. Annapolis, Maryland, had 18 inches of snow by Saturday. State officials at the briefing said 2,400 pieces of equipment were trying to clear highways. The state also was relying on 300 National Guard members to help with ongoing weather trouble. Check on traffic and road conditions. More than 750 personnel are clearing roads in Washington, Mayor Adrian Fenty said. But the heavy, wet snow has even trapped some plows, Washington Department of Transportation director Gabe Klein said. Flights were canceled at Washington-Baltimore area's three main airports and at Philadelphia International Airport. Amtrak has canceled many trains in and out of Washington, and Greyhound has been halted until 1 p.m. Sunday, Klein said. Check on flight delays. On Friday, a weather-related accident in Virginia's Wythe County left two dead, state police said. A father and son stopped on a shoulder to help injured occupants of a disabled vehicle. Minutes later, a tractor-trailer jackknifed and struck their van while trying to avoid hitting the disabled car. The father and son died at the scene, state police said. Virginia state police said the accident was one of many crashes and disabled cars reported. Winter storm warnings were in effect from southern Indiana eastward to New York City and south to North Carolina, with blizzard warnings for Washington, Delaware and the New Jersey coast. Are you snowed in? Share photos and videos. Delaware Gov. Jack Markell declared a state of emergency Friday night and ordered all vehicles off the roads by 10 p.m. ET.

Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine died Sunday, her longtime friend Noel Beutel said Monday. She was 96. Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.  Question: \\"How old was Joan Fontaine when she moved to Saratoga?\\" Response: \\"Three\\" Select from the following.  1). no.  2). yes. Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"2). yes. The response correctly answers the question because the text says Joan Fontaine was born in 1916 and moved to Saratoga, California in 1919 with her mother. The difference in years is 3, so she was 3 years old when she moved to Saratoga. The other answer, \\"no,\\" is wrong because it implies that the response does not answer the question correctly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer a question about this article: Hanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean \\"high (river)bank\\", though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia. Which city was Hanover connected to by the Leine?","output":"Hanover was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The quake was centered an hour and a half northwest of Acapulco. The quake was a shallow 15 miles at the epicenter, the U.S. Geological Survey says. A building was damaged in Mexico City, 170 miles from quake's epicenter. Article:","output":"Title: Mexico Rocked by Powerful Earthquake: A Firsthand Account of the Devastating Impact Introduction Mexico experienced a powerful earthquake that was unmistakable for anyone in its wake. As one local shared, \\"There was no way not to feel it.\\" Centered an hour and a half northwest of the famed beach destination of Acapulco, this natural disaster has left an indelible mark on the nation and its people. Earthquake Details As reported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the quake's epicenter was located at a shallow depth of 15 miles, which likely exacerbated the severity of the tremors felt on the surface. The geographical location of the earthquake made the effects of the quake all the more destructive. Situated in a densely populated region, the risk of damage to infrastructure was significantly heightened. Damages and Impact While the earthquake was centered relatively close to Acapulco, the tremors were strong enough to cause damage to a building in Mexico City, which is 170 miles away from the epicenter. Mexico City, being one of the country's most populous and bustling urban centers, experienced chaos as panicked citizens sought to evacuate their homes, offices, and public spaces.  The immediate aftermath of the earthquake reveals a sobering landscape in and around Acapulco. Homes, businesses, and essential infrastructure have been damaged to varying degrees, with many structures deemed unsafe for people to enter. The emotional consequences of the disaster are also evident, as people have lost their cherished belongings, sense of security, and in some cases, their loved ones. Rescue Efforts and Government Response In response to the cataclysmic event, numerous rescue teams, both local and international, have mobilized to lend their expertise and assistance to the affected population. Emergency personnel have been working tirelessly to address the urgent needs, including search and rescue operations, setting up temporary shelters, and aiding in the distribution of essential supplies such as food, water, and medical provisions. The Mexican government has also responded swiftly, pledging to allocate significant resources to not only support those directly affected by the earthquake but also to orchestrate a comprehensive recovery plan. Officials recognize the importance of both short-term relief and long-term solutions aimed at rebuilding and restoring communities to a sense of normalcy. Moving Forward In the wake of this devastating natural disaster, the resilience of the Mexican people has been on full display in the determination to heal, rebuild, and move forward. The arduous process of recovery will undoubtedly require an unwavering spirit of cooperation, both within Mexico and from the global community. As experts continue to assess the full scale of damage caused by the earthquake, it is critical to remember the importance of preparedness and planning in mitigating the disastrous impact of such events. Natural disasters are an unfortunate reminder of our vulnerability and the need to develop more robust measures against their devastating consequences. Conclusion \\"There was no way not to feel it,\\" a villager aptly described the sensation of the recent earthquake that left an undeniable impact on Mexico, both tangibly and emotionally. The powerful temblor was centered northwest of Acapulco, but its reach extended far beyond, including damages to a building in Mexico City. Spanning from immediate rescue efforts to long-term rebuilding and recovery initiatives, the Mexican earthquake highlights the interconnectedness of our world and offers a cautionary tale, underscoring the need for effective disaster planning and community resilience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Gary, a high school student, is supposed to be studying two different cells under a microscope during his biology class. Gary doesn't like biology class at all though and can't find the motivation to look at the cells in detail. In his homework where students are supposed to write what they observed, Gary simply wrote down the first thing he saw under the microscope which was that Cell A is larger than cell B. It won't get him a great grade, but Gary is hoping it will at least get him a pass on the assignment.  Does Cell A or Cell B have more folds across the membrane?  Hint: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli . Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information about cell growth and surface area, it is likely that Cell A, being the larger cell, has more folds across the membrane than Cell B. When a cell increases in size, its volume grows at a faster rate than its surface area. As a result, larger cells face the challenge of having a smaller surface area relative to their volume, which can hinder the efficient transport of nutrients into the cell and waste materials out of the cell. To overcome this challenge, larger cells often adapt by developing more folds throughout their membrane, increasing the surface area available for material transport. Additionally, larger cells may develop other structures to increase their surface area and facilitate material transport. Some white blood cells, for instance, grow more nuclei to supply enough proteins and RNA for their needs. Similarly, certain cells in the small intestine form protrusions called microvilli, which help increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. In Gary's case, although he did not observe the cells in detail, the information that Cell A is larger than Cell B suggests that Cell A has developed more cell membrane folds to accommodate its increased size and higher demand for efficient nutrient transport. However, without further observation and analysis, it is essential to note that this conclusion is based on general knowledge about cell growth and surface area relationships, and specific characteristics of the cells under study may deviate from this pattern."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paraphrasing involves restating the same information or ideas in different words while maintaining the original meaning. In this case, both sentences convey the same information about Ram Hill, Nutridge Hill, and their connections to other locations in 1815. Let's break down the similarities and differences between the two sentences: 1. Both mention Ram Hill's former name as Nutridge Hill in 1815:     - In the first sentence: \\"In the Mudge Map 1815, Ram Hill was known as Nutridge Hill\\"    - In the second sentence: \\"In 1815, Ram Hill was known as Nutridge Hill\\" 2. Both mention the connection between Ram Hill/Nutridge Hill and Westerleigh:    - In the first sentence: \\"and was linked to Mays Hill by Westerleigh\\"    - In the second sentence: \\"and was connected to Westerleigh by the Broad Lane\\"    Note that the second sentence refers to the connection as \\"Broad Lane,\\" which isn't mentioned in the first sentence. Despite this minor discrepancy, the general idea of the connection is the same. 3. Both mention the connection between Ram Hill/Nutridge Hill and Mays Hill:    - In the first sentence: \\"and to Broad Lane by Frog Lane\\"    - In the second sentence: \\"and Mays Hill by Frog Lane\\"    Although the ordering of the latter part of each sentence is slightly different, they both convey the same idea that Ram Hill/Nutridge Hill was connected to Mays Hill via Frog Lane. 4. Sentence structure is different:    - The first sentence contains more details and a more complex structure, mentioning the \\"Mudge Map 1815\\" while the second sentence omits the reference to the map and has a more concise sentence structure. In summary, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, as they convey the same information about Ram Hill's former name and its connections to Mays Hill and Westerleigh in 1815, despite slight differences in sentence structure and detail."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The principal bridesmaid, if one is so designated, may be called the chief bridesmaid or maid of honor if she is unmarried, or the matron of honor if she is married. A junior bridesmaid is a girl who is clearly too young to be married, but who is included as an honorary bridesmaid. In the United States, typically only the maid/matron of honor and the best man are the official witnesses for the wedding license. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that can i have a maid of honour and chief bridesmaid?  [A]. no [B]. yes The answer is:","output":"[B]. yes It is true that you can have both a maid of honor and a chief bridesmaid in your wedding party. Having both roles allows you to honor two special people in your life and can help to distribute the responsibilities typically associated with a single maid of honor. The maid of honor is typically a close friend or family member who is unmarried, while the chief bridesmaid can be another close friend or relative. Sometimes, the term \\"chief bridesmaid\\" is used interchangeably with \\"matron of honor\\", which is the title given to a married bridesmaid taking on a similar role. Assigning these roles depends on personal preference and the relationships you have with the members of your bridal party. Both the maid of honor and chief bridesmaid can assist you with various wedding planning tasks and provide emotional support throughout the process. They can help with organizing events like the bridal shower and bachelorette party, coordinating tasks with other bridesmaids, and providing assistance on the wedding day itself. In large bridal parties, having both a maid of honor and a chief bridesmaid can be especially helpful in managing responsibilities and ensuring that everything runs smoothly. The roles may overlap, and both can share similar responsibilities, allowing for a well-rounded and accessible support system during your wedding preparations and the ceremony itself. It is essential to communicate with your maid of honor and chief bridesmaid about what you expect from each role and discuss how they can work together to make your special day a success. In the end, the key to a successful wedding party lies in careful planning, organization, and, above all, meaningful relationships with those who surround and support you on your big day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below      Sometimes your freshman college roommate becomes your bff4lyfe ... but sometimes they don't. For Penn State students Jessica and Nikki, it's the latter situation, and because we live in a world run by social media, their drama is been playing out on Twitter.      Jessica recently discovered all the unpleasant things her roommate had tweeted about her, so she printed them out and turned them into a passive-aggressive collage that she then put up in their room. In a case of meta-revenge-tweeting, she then posted a photo of the collage on Twitter, where it promptly went insanely viral.      In an interview with Fusion, Jessica explained that she \\"wanted her to acknowledge what she did. I was upset, so I wanted her to be upset.\\" Apparently, Nikki did not appreciate the gesture.            Advertisement - Continue Reading Below      Advertisement - Continue Reading Below      And things escalated quickly from there. Following an unsuccessful intervention from their RA, both apparently called campus police on each other — Jessica on Nikki for harassment, per her Twitter feed, and Nikki on Jessica because she claimed she'd been smoking marijuana in the dorm room. Peace negotiations did not go well either:      Advertisement - Continue Reading Below      At present, it seems they're at a stalemate.      Jessica told Fusion she is meeting with college officials to get a different room. Still, \\"it made me feel good that I defended myself,\\" she added. Meanwhile, the internet is just waiting for the Lifetime movie version of the events that have transpired. ||||| Jessica Taylor’s first few weeks as a freshman at Penn State went about as typically as you might expect: she’s majoring in psychology; she joined a sorority (Phi Mu); she didn’t really get along with her roommate in her dorm. What can you do?      Then she found out her roommate was subtweeting the hell out of her on Twitter, and as the social contract between 18-years-old left alone in the world for the first time demands, her revenge was swift and viral. Taylor printed out all her roommates tweets about her and taped them up in their dorm. Then she snapped a photo of her depraved gallery wall and tweeted it herself. Bazinga: 80,000 retweets in one day.      today i found all the subtweets my roommate has made about me, so i printed them out and hung them up in our dorm ❤ pic.twitter.com/fQghyj7seZ — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 27, 2016      There was, to be brief, a lot of alleged drama that followed: Taylor was harassed by her dorm floor neighbors and forced her roommate to sleep in another room. Oh, and the campus police came to her dorm for the second time in a week.      In a brief phone interview, Taylor told Fusion why she did what she did, why the police ended up intervening, and whether she’d do it again. The following transcript has been lightly edited and condensed.      Do you remember your first interaction with your roommate? Were you friends? Was it cordial?            No. Well, basically, I had an original roommate, but she ended up switching out. So [the roommate in question] became my new roommate. And from the beginning, I messaged her, and I was like, “We’re going to be roommates!”      And then she was like “Oh, I want to be able to choose my roommate.” Then, she was trying to get me moved out so she could have somebody else be her roommate or whatever, and I didn’t want to. She talked to the RA about it, and she told me to move out on Monday, after she called the police on me.      also to add on to how shitty my roommate, she called the cops on me yesterday bc i had weed and she hates me — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 27, 2016      At first, she was kinda nice, but soon, she started to get kind of mean and pissy at me. I’d be like, “How was your day?” And she’d just be like, “Good.” She wouldn’t talk to me.      So you suspected she didn’t like you early on?            Yeah.      And then you came across those tweets just a couple of days ago?            Yeah.      What was your reaction?            Well, basically, I was really pissed off at first, so I texted her, and she didn’t—she didn’t really acknowledge that I had a problem with it, which was what led me to posting the tweets on the wall.      What was your thought process there?            I just wanted a way to acknowledge it, and acknowledge that it isn’t right, which is why I posted it on the wall.      How did you think she was going to react?            I don’t know! I kind of hoped she’d be upset. I wanted her to acknowledge what she did. I was upset, so I wanted her to be upset.      Did she see them on the wall before you tweeted them out?            No.      You tweeted it out, and then it blew up, right?            Immediately, it blew up.      Why did the police end up coming?            When I got back to my dorm, there were people crowded outside my dorm yelling at me and calling me a bitch and knocking on my door. I felt like I was being harassed—it wasn’t that I thought it was that serious. It was the RA that came, and recommended I [call the police].      And I wanted to feel like I could stay in the dorm, and not feel like I was being harassed.      When did you hear from your roommate?            I didn’t talk to her until the police came, and then they made us sit down and talk to each other. I told her that she never told me she had a problem with me, and she told me that she did tell me that she had a problem with me. She said that she had told me to clean my sheets, and I didn’t. And even if she did, she’s not my mom.      What did the police end up doing?            Nothing. They just talked to the people on the floor.      Did you have friends on the floor backing you up?            No, I don’t have friends on the floor. They’re all friends with my roommate.      So what’s the roommate situation right now?            I’m gonna move out, most likely.      Related This subtweet drama at Penn State is your worst freshman dorm nightmare come alive      Because you think it’ll be too much tension?            Yeah. I’m gonna meet with [the school] tomorrow, and they’re going to find me a room.      Has it been overwhelming?            Not really. I mean, a little, yeah. My phone’s constantly blowing up.      Would you handle it the same way, if you could live it over again?            Yeah, probably.      How come?            I don’t know, I just feel like it made her really own up to her responsibility. And it made me feel good that I defended myself. ||||| We can't pick our family, we can't pick who we fall in love with, and we can't pick our freshman college roommate. So begins the saga of @jessyjeanie and @nikkihomanick, two young women enrolled in Penn State (class of '20), fated to share dorm space for an entire school year.      It's difficult to say how their beef really began, but let's call it a clash of temperament. Like all mismatched roommates, the girls have blown off steam about one another's infractions; the crucial detail here is that they were doing so on social media. That meant some subtweeting, which prompted some IRL passive-aggressive behavior, which in turn went viral.      so many people outside waiting for me and talking about me except my actual roommate pic.twitter.com/R3vz6A6pCw — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 28, 2016      @_thegingiraffe she got to get all of friends to harrass me because she cant do it herself — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 28, 2016      Isn't higher education inspiring? The future leaders of the world at work. Anyway, this collage is pretty hilarious, though not exactly a defusing tactic.Word travels even faster on campus than it does on the internet, and as a result, the Jessy-Nikki war was soon the talk of PSU, then all of Philly.And while Nikki hasn't addressed the fallout on Twitter, Jessy has had to defend herself against her roommates' friends and assorted haters—in between retweeting examples of Nikki's evidently prodigious drinking.The peace talks, meanwhile, collapsed almost as soon as they began.Then, the most dreaded of all texts.That poor guy has no idea what he's walking into—but, as we all know, becoming an RA is a Faustian bargain. RIP, dude.      Oh, also? When enough Team Nikki forces amassed outside the room, Jessy called the campus police herself to dispel them. This is almost definitely how these people want to make a living.      light of my life university police pic.twitter.com/2cnwqznGDA — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 28, 2016      she also said it was very wrong for her to post those subtweets :( i wonder if she had felt that way if she didnt get caught — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 28, 2016      @PleaseGetMePreg nah shes sleeping in a different room for now — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 28, 2016      It seems, for now, that there's no solution in sight.But hey, it could be worse. They only have to avoid each other while sharing a room for the next eight months, then not run into each other at school for another three years, and then spend the rest of their lives dodging one another at class reunions. And never, ever tweet again, for any reason.      Piece of cake. ||||| She had her desk lamp on again. In the 12-foot-wide room that the two near-strangers shared, that lamp felt as bright as a spotlight.      Jessica Taylor hated that Nikki, her college roommate, kept the light on to do homework late into the night. She needed to get to sleep at 11 p.m., and couldn’t with that bright light shining just feet from her pillow. Nikki, meanwhile, was very tidy, and couldn’t stand that Jessica’s side of the room was so messy and cluttered. She suspected that Jessica was the one responsible for a mysterious stain on the carpet, and she thought her sleep-deprived roommate should just buy a sleeping mask if the lights bothered her so much.      “Right off the bat she annoyed me,” Jessica told The Washington Post. For the first few weeks of college, however, the mismatched roommates tried to keep the peace. “When we moved in, she was pretty nice,” Jessica said.      Time went on, and neither Penn State freshman talked to each other about the increasing tension between them. Instead, one of them — Nikki — found another way to vent: She told the Internet about it instead.      “Two weeks down, and I already hate my roommate,” she tweeted in early September. Later that day, she tweeted again: “My roommate situation is a horror story.”      [The true story behind ‘Zola,’ the epic Twitter story too crazy to be real]      Jessica and Nikki were well on their way to becoming each other’s college roommate horror stories by then. Bad roommates — and the ugly fights that come with them — happen to the best of us in college. But the feuds don’t usually play out on social media, with various snipes gathering 100,000 retweets. And that’s exactly what happened after Jessica found her roommate’s Twitter account.      “today i found all the subtweets my roommate has made about me, so i printed them out and hung them up in our dorm ❤️” Taylor tweeted Tuesday afternoon:      today i found all the subtweets my roommate has made about me, so i printed them out and hung them up in our dorm ❤ pic.twitter.com/fQghyj7seZ — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 27, 2016      About five minutes after tweeting her handiwork, Jessica told me, that tweet started to go viral. So she tweeted again: “To add on to how s[—-] my roommate, she called the cops on me yesterday bc i had weed and she hates me.”      Another tweet contained what appeared to be images of text messages between the two roommates, detailing the fight they had just before Jessica tweeted about her revenge.      “Yeah i shouldn’t have tweeted that but I did so that’s that,” Nikki texted her roommate after being called out for her subtweets. “This is going to be really uncomfortable if you keep feeding the fire.”      In the exchange, Nikki says she didn’t go to the “police,” but did report the smell of weed to their hall’s RA, triggering the involvement of campus law enforcement. “When I walk into the room and it smells like weed yes yes it does effect me,” she texted Jessica.      “How??” Jessica replied. “I mean literally if it bothered you you have a conversation with me about it not call the police lol.”      “Weed is illegal don’t have it in the room or I will tell the RA again,” Nikki responded. “It’s up to them what to do from there and if they call the cops that’s not my problem nor do I care.”      Suddenly, thousands of strangers on the Internet were following every detail. And most of them were rooting for Jessica.      “It felt good to be able to complain about her, so that people could understand,” Jessica told me.      The “roommate horror story” is a viral genre at this point, and Jessica’s story isn’t even the first one this year. A few weeks ago, a UCLA freshman tweeted out a image of a dramatic email she received from her new roommate before they even arrived on campus, an email that New York magazine described as “more dramatic about bunk beds than anyone has ever been in the entire history of humanity.”      But the UCLA email went viral largely detached from the identity of the person who sent it. Not so in the case of the Penn State dispute: Nikki’s Twitter handle was visible in Jessica’s tweets, and it didn’t take long for the Internet’s amateur vigilante detectives to get to work.      Jessica’s new fans started combing through Nikki’s Instagram account, posting photographs that appeared to show the college freshman drinking alcohol — which, Jessica told The Post, proved that her roommate’s objection to her weed habit was “hypocritical.”      When Nikki’s friends — along with some strangers — started to reply to Jessica to defend Nikki, the newly born “Uncle Jessy” fandom knew exactly what to do when Jessica called them out:      she took it to twitter she literally subtweeted me its not my fault it blew up https://t.co/RiWJQklrwJ — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 28, 2016      “all these people defending her all going on private when theyre proved wrong lmao,” Jessica wrote in a tweet, to which she attached a screenshot of a now-protected account.      Things were playing out a bit differently in the physical world. Nikki had few defenders on Twitter, but she was the better liked of the two roommates on their dormitory hall. Jessica said Nikki had gotten really close to most of the people on the hall and “got them not to like me.”      One of Nikki’s friends, Jessica said, came into the room and tore down her subtweet display:      aw looks like she was mad :( pic.twitter.com/0oTz9u4tUb — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 28, 2016      Nikki’s friends remained outside the room. Jessica said she called campus police about it, to report that she was being “harassed” by them.      light of my life university police pic.twitter.com/2cnwqznGDA — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 28, 2016      Jessica said she never intended her tweets to spread beyond her own friends, whom she assumed would find the whole thing really funny. I asked her how she felt about strangers digging through her roommate’s photos, independently trying to find things to damage Nikki’s reputation online and complete the picture that her viral story had started to paint of this person.      “I don’t know,” she said. “I really don’t know. Part of me feels bad, but a part of me feels like she’s the one who instigated it.”      she also said it was very wrong for her to post those subtweets :( i wonder if she had felt that way if she didnt get caught — uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie) September 28, 2016      A spokeswoman for Penn State said the university could not comment on disciplinary measures against students, and referred us to the university’s police logs, which do show two incidents — one a student report of an odor of marijuana, another a report of harassment — that took place in the roommates’ dorm building, at times that roughly correspond to Jessica’s version of events.      Nikki hasn’t tweeted about her roommate since the story went viral, and didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview. We have confirmed Nikki’s full name and enrollment via the Penn State student directory, but we are only identifying her by her first name here.      Her friend Analisa, also a student at Penn State, told me that Nikki was trying to “lay low.”      “She regretted her tweets, and that any of this had happened, and she wished she could go back and change what happened,” Analisa said in an email. “She too is scared for her future.”      And, as it turns out, so is Analisa, who became involved in this viral tale after she caught wind of what was happening to her friend.      “These people on Twitter looked up her photo accounts and started posting her pictures, making fun of her, calling her names, basically cyberstalking her,” she said.      The two knew each other as members of the same dance troupe. Analisa describes her teammate as a “kind,” “genuine” person who had made a ton of friends on campus. “People gravitate towards her,” she said.      “I took it upon myself to report [the harassment] to the university police,” Analisa told me, a request that was forwarded to State College police. When Jessica found out, she was furious. From her perspective, it was her roommate who began everything. She was simply defending herself, she tweeted. And now someone was saying she was “apparently the one guilty of harassment??” she wrote. “lmao.”      [The dark side of going viral that no one talks about]      Jessica took a picture of Analisa’s Twitter account and tweeted it to her followers. Soon, a bunch of strangers were combing through her life, doing to Analisa what they’d already done to Nikki.      “Random strangers who are barely informed on the scandal would enter my inbox and call me a slut, or a ‘dumb hoe b—,’ tell me to go kill myself, or my personal favorite; ‘you’re a dirty dumb irrelevant whore, find a life outside of your bimbo half-degraded brain, stupid slut,’ ” Analisa wrote.      Jessica has since deleted the call-out that prompted all those emails. But Analisa says that the damage has already been done to her reputation. “I am at risk for losing my internship,” she told me. “I am scared of future professors or peers associating me with this scandal, and especially future jobs.” And that is why we’re only identifying Analisa by her first name, too.      It’s easy to understand why a viral tale of a passive-aggressive roommate getting called out for her subtweets has delighted the Internet. But the fallout hasn’t, arguably, left any of them much better off. Because a feud between two frustrated roommates so captured the imagination of the Internet, two college students are now justifiably terrified that their reputations will never recover.      And even though Jessica has found a satisfying outlet for her frustration, choosing the nuclear option is going to have consequences beyond her viral fame.      But first, she has to figure out where she’s going to live.      More reading: ||||| Brutal.

Q:Background: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.  Paragraph: Two farmers sold their produce and milk on a large nearby market. John practiced organic farming and also produced organic milk, while Danny sold non-organic produce and milk.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farmer had fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on his farm? A:","output":"Based on the given background information, it is clear that organic farming practices generally result in fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens due to the restricted use of antibiotics. Therefore, it can be concluded that John, the farmer who practiced organic farming and produced organic milk, had fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on his farm as compared to Danny, who sold non-organic produce and milk. This is because John adhered to the principles of organic farming, which avoids the use of antibiotics as a preventative measure, thus reducing the chances of developing antibiotic resistant pathogens.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Options: - one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them - not enough information - when one is able to acquire produce in bulk - after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating Answer:","output":"The author advises that adding superfoods should occur after beginning clean eating as follows: one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Raffaele Sollecito has paid a secret visit to the grave of murdered student Meredith Kercher, it has emerged. Computer studies graduate Sollecito, 29, is currently back on trial accused of the brutal knife killing, along with his former girlfriend Amanda Knox, 26. The news that he went to Meredith's grave will come as a shock to members of her family, who have asked several times that Knox stay away from the final resting place - despite her making several pleas to visit. Raffaele Sollecito, right,  has paid a secret visit to the grave of murdered student Meredith Kercher, it has emerged. Sollecito, 29, is currently back on trial accused of the brutal knife killing, along with Amanda Knox. Details of Sollecito's secret trip to the grave emerged during an Italian TV programme to mark the sixth year anniversary of the murder in Perugia, and came just days before he is due to attend the retrial ordered by Italy's Supreme Court earlier this year. According to the programme Sollecito was taken to the cemetery at Coulsdon, Surrey, by an English friend of his while visiting London in March - at the same time as the retrial was announced. He did not ask for permission from Meredith's family and, according to the Quarto Grado show, 'said a silent prayer' for the British student but he did not leave any flowers. Knox, left, stunned the Kercher family saying that she hoped one day she could visit Kercher's grave. However Meredith's sister Stephanie Kercher, made it clear the family will not concede to her wish. Meredith had arrived in Perugia in September 2007 to study Italian as part of her University of Leeds course, and she had shared a house with Amanda Knox and two other women. The Kercher family have never accepted Sollecito and Knox's insistence they had nothing to do with Meredith's murder - the 20-year-old was found semi naked with her throat cut in her bedroom in the house she shared with Knox and two Italian women. In September Knox stunned the Kercher family with a bizarre request, saying that she hoped one day she could visit the final resting place of her friend. However in a statement Meredith's sister Stephanie Kercher made it clear the family will not concede to her wish, as she said: 'Her grave is now the safest place for her, she can rest in peace and be with us. I hope that is respected by everybody. 'It took five years for us to be ready as a family to bury Meredith, and even today it is still extremely painful. Now she has a place where we and her friends can go spend some time with her and take her some flowers. 'I hope that she can continue to rest. in peace, despite the judicial process still ongoing but, knowing Mez,. she will fight until the end. The 6th of November 2007 was the hardest day. of my life. I had to go to Italy to identify the body of my little. sister, stretched out cold and lifeless. 'I. would not wish that on anyone, it is something I will never forget. My. mother and I were the last ones to hug Mez that day, to let her know that. we were there and that we were there to bring her home.' Knox. and then boyfriend Sollecito were arrested and. charged five days after the murder in November 2007. At their initial. trial in 2009 they were convicted and sentenced to 26 years and 25 years. respectively. But two years later an appeal court sensationally overturned the original verdict and they were immediately freed, with Knox flying back to her home in Seattle - where she was given a hero's welcome - and Sollecito returning to his home in Bisceglie near Bari. However, it has since emerged that he has moved to the Caribbean island of the Dominican Republic - but his father has insisted he will return later this week to appear at the trial in Florence, where he is expected to make a formal statement to the court. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito pictured outside the rented house in Perugia, Italy on November 2, 2007, the day after British student Meredith Kercher was murdered. Italian police surround the rented home in Perugia, Italy where Miss Kercher was discovered in November 2007 with her throat cut. Last week a fresh forensic report ordered by the court was leaked and it revealed that although Knox's DNA was on a knife believed to be the murder weapon, crucially there was no trace of Kercher or Sollecito on it. Sollecito's father Francesco said:'I have communicated the results to my son and naturally he is delighted. We have always said he had nothing to do with the death of poor Meredith. He is living in the Dominican Republic at the moment but he will return this week for the trial.' Mr Sollecito added he had 'no details' of his son's visit to the grave but said his son has always felt huge sympathy for the Kercher family for the loss of Meredith. Drifter Rudy Guede, 26, was convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith in 2008 and sentenced to 30 years but this was later reduced to 16 years and he could be released on parole by 2018.","output":"Sure, kiddo!

This surprised many people, especially Meredith's family. They don't want Amanda to visit Meredith's grave.  3. People found out about Raffaele's secret visit when it was mentioned on a TV show.

How would the previous sentence be correctly capitalized?","output":"The correct capitalization of the sentence would be:  \\"A Tactile and Fun Alternative to the Charm Links Bracelet with an Expandable Diameter to Fit Most Sizes.\\" It is important to note a few details about capitalization in English: 1. Capitalize the first word of the sentence: This is a basic rule in English. Even if the sentence is a quote inside another sentence, the first word should be capitalized. For instance, if our initial sentence was used in a bigger sentence: \\"She was excited to launch 'A Tactile and Fun Alternative to the Charm Links Bracelet with an Expandable Diameter to Fit Most Sizes.'\\" 2. Capitalize proper nouns: These include names of individuals, companies, brands, cities, countries, or products. 3. Titles and subtitles: In titles and subtitles of books, articles, songs, etc., major words, especially those that carry substantial meaning, should be capitalized. For instance, in the initial sentence, the 'Charm Links Bracelet' can be viewed as a title or proper noun, hence, it's capitalized. 4. Do not capitalize small words within a title: Short prepositions (at, by, for, in, of, on, up, etc.), conjunctions (and, as, but, if, or, etc.), and articles (a, an, the) are typically not capitalized. However, if any of these words begin or end the title or subtitle, they should be capitalized. The specific rules for capitalization can vary depending on the stylistic guide one is following.

That's a sizable saving when you consider that braces treatment averages around 5000. If you decide to pay with this method, you'll make the payment during the visit in which the braces are put on. What that means is, if you have enough money to pay for the whole cost of the braces at one time, you can actually save some money. Because, some dentist offices give special discounts that can be around 3% to 7 % if you pay the whole cost at once. This can be a good saving when you think about the fact that braces usually cost around 5000 on average. If you decide to do this, you would usually make the payment when you go to the dentist to get the braces put on."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He says that \\"evolution occurs by a process called natural selection\\" and \\"speciation is an extension of evolution\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Choices:  1). competition.  2). root growth.  3). mitosis.  4). meiosis.  5). speciation.  6). cellular respiration.  7). Plants growth.  8). Animal survival. Answer:","output":"Answer: 5). speciation. Based on the hints provided by the teacher, we can deduce that the best answer is 'speciation'. The teacher mentioned that \\"evolution occurs by a process called natural selection,\\" which is the overarching concept behind the question. Furthermore, the teacher also said, \\"speciation is an extension of evolution.\\" Now, let's break down the other choices to understand why they are not the correct answer. 1). Competition: Competition does play a role in natural selection as organisms compete for resources, and survival favors those best suited to their environment. However, it is not the overarching process being asked here. 2). Root growth: This refers to the growth of plant roots, which is unrelated to the concept of natural selection. 3). Mitosis: Mitosis is a process of cell division that occurs in eukaryotic cells. It plays a role in growth, repair, and maintenance, but not directly in natural selection. 4). Meiosis: Meiosis is another type of cell division that occurs in eukaryotic cells, specifically during the formation of gametes for sexual reproduction. It contributes to genetic variation, which is important for natural selection, but again, it is not the overarching process being asked here. 6). Cellular respiration: Cellular respiration is the process by which cells produce energy. While it is essential for life, it is unrelated to the concept of natural selection. 7). Plants growth: Plant growth is a result of various processes, including root growth and cellular respiration mentioned above. While plant growth may be impacted by natural selection, it is not the primary process being asked about in the question. 8). Animal survival: Animal survival is closely related to the process of natural selection, as those individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. However, it is still not the main process being asked in the question. In conclusion, speciation is the best answer to the question as it directly ties into the concept of natural selection and its role in evolution, as mentioned by the teacher's hints. Speciation refers to the process by which new species arise from existing populations as a result of various factors, including natural selection, genetic drift, and changes in the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

John Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 - August 12, 1992) was an American composer and music theorist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives. In 2012, amongst a wide range of American and international centennial celebrations, an eight-day festival was held in Washington DC, with venues found notably more amongst the city's art museums and universities than performance spaces. Earlier in the centennial year, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas presented Cage's Song Books with the San Francisco Symphony at Carnegie Hall in New York. Another celebration came, for instance, in Darmstadt, Germany, which in July 2012 renamed its central station the John Cage Railway Station during the term of its annual new-music courses. At the Ruhrtriennale in Germany, Heiner Goebbels staged a production of Europeras 1 & 2 in a 36,000 sq ft converted factory and commissioned a production of Lecture on Nothing created and performed by Robert Wilson. Jacaranda Music had four concerts planned in Santa Monica, California, for the centennial week. John Cage Day was the name given to several events held during 2012 to mark the centenary of his birth.  A 2012 project was curated by Juraj Kojs to celebrate the centenary of Cage's birth, titled On Silence: Homage to Cage. It consisted of 13 commissioned works created by composers from around the global such as Kasia Glowicka, Adrian Knight and Henry Vega, each being 4 minutes and 33 seconds long in honor of Cage's famous 1952 opus, 4'33''. The program was supported by the Foundation for Emerging Technologies and Arts, Laura Kuhn and the John Cage Trust.  In a homage to Cage's dance work, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company in July 2012 \\"performed an engrossing piece called 'Story/Time'. It was modeled on Cage's 1958 work 'Indeterminacy', in which [Cage and then Jones, respectively,] sat alone onstage, reading aloud ... series of one-minute stories [they]'d written.

You can think of a significant digit as an \\"interesting\\" or an \\"important\\" digit that gives you useful information about a number. This means that any zeroes to the right of whole numbers or to the left of decimals can be discounted because they are placeholders. To find the number of significant digits in a number, just count the number of digits from left to right. Here are some examples:  1.239 has 4 significant digits 134.9 has 4 significant digits .0165 has 3 significant digits This depends on the problem you're working with. If you're rounding a number to two significant digits, for example, then you'll need to identify the second significant digit of the number and then use the number to the right of it to see if you should round it down or up. Here are some examples:  1.239 rounded to 3 significant digits is 1.24. This is because the digit to the right of the third digit, 3, is a 9, which is 5 or more. 134.9 rounded to 1 significant digit is 100. This is because the digit to the right of the digit in the hundreds place, or the first digit, 1, is 3, which is less than 5. 0.0165 rounded to 2 significant digits is 0.017. This is because the second significant digit is 6, and the number to the right of it, 5, makes it round up. To do this, you will first have to add up the numbers you are given. Then, you will have to find the number with the lowest amount of significant digits and then round your entire answer to that place. Here's how you do it:  13.214 + 234.6 + 7.0350 + 6.38 = 261.2290 See that the second number, 234.6, is only accurate to the tenths place, or four significant digits. Round the answer so that it is only accurate to the tenths place. 261.2290 becomes 261.2. First, multiply all of the numbers that you are given. Then, check them to see which number is rounded to the least amount of significant digits. Finally, round your finally answer to match the level of accuracy of that number. Here's how you do it:  16.235 × 0.217 × 5 = 17.614975 Notice that the 5 number only has one significant digit. This means that your final answer will only have one significant digit as well. 17.614975 rounded to one significant digit becomes 20.","output":"A significant digit represents valuable information in a number, and counting them from left to right helps in rounding and performing mathematical operations while maintaining accuracy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -23*g + 203 = 6*g - 58 for g.","output":"Sure, let's solve the equation step by step. 1. The given equation is: -23 * g + 203 = 6 * g - 58 2. To isolate g, we first need to move all terms containing g to one side of the equation. Let's move the 6 * g term to the left side by subtracting it from both sides of the equation:    (-23 * g - 6 * g) + 203 = -58 3. Simplify the left side by combining the g terms:     -29 * g + 203 = -58 4. Next, let's move the constant term (203) to the right side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides:    -29 * g = -58 - 203 5. Simplify the right side:    -29 * g = -261 6. Finally, to find the value of g, divide both sides by -29:    g = -261 / -29 7. Simplify the expression:    g = 9 So, the solution is g = 9."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Drama critic John Earl observes a piece of artwork in a museum, gazing at it reverently. He asks the museum curator how much it costs, and the curator says that it is not for sale. The artist, James Harlan Corbin [Lederer], does not wish to sell the painting. Nonplussed, Earl returns to his office and phones Corbin with his proposal to sell. Again, Corbin refuses. Earl continues his pursuit to find out who the model for the painting was. He learns it is Helen North, a young woman who looks nothing like the woman in the painting. He visits with her to learn his location, but she refuses, telling him that she will be singing at a local nightclub, where Corbin frequents. Earl finds both of them in the museum, and again confronts Corbin. Becoming clearly annoyed, Corbin invites the singer out for a night in his yacht. She agrees, but is later found washed ashore. Although Police Lt. Roberts initially questions Helen's suitor Hunt Mason, Mason implicates Corbin as the last person who saw Helen North. John Earl works with the police department to arrange for Helen's sister Linda to apply for modeling, in order to spy on Corbin. The two return to Corbin's boathouse. While there, Linda calls for Earl and tells his chef that she is in danger and to notify the police. There, she learns that Corbin did not murder her sister. Thereafter, she falls in love with Corbin and agrees to support him against the district attorney's allegations he killed both Helen and another model, Madonna. Although Corbin has visions that he did so, Linda tells him to make sure he is telling the truth before confessing such heinous crimes. Linda returns home with Corbin's mother, who poisons her tea and tries to inject her with a lethal substance before police shoot. Corbin had suddenly recognized who it was that had planted evidence at the boathouse to implicate him. Police arrive just in time to save Linda from death but not Mrs. Corbin, who dies in her son's arms. Answer:","output":"Linda, Helen North's sister, falls in love with James Harlan Corbin.

Saksan yhdistymisen jälkeisten ongelmien käsittely on varmasti jättänyt pysyvän jäljen Euroopan historiankirjoihin. Vaikka on totta, että tämä voimakas tapahtuma vaikutti suuresti maan sisäiseen ja ulkoiseen tilanteeseen, ei ole oikeudenmukaista vetää yleistä johtopäätöstä, että samanlaiset ongelmat olisivat yleisiä kaikissa Euroopan maissa tai että niiden pitäisi ohjata laajempaa eurooppalaista politiikkaa. Saksan yhdistymisprosessiin liittyi monia seikkoja, jotka olivat ainutlaatuisia sille tietylle ajalle ja tilanteelle. Itse asiassa tärkeimmät haasteet liittyivät maan taloudelliseen integraatioon, infrastruktuuriin, yhteiskunnallisiin kysymyksiin, kuten työttömyyteen ja elintasoon, sekä maiden aiempiin poliittisiin eroihin. Eurooppa 2000-luvulla on kuitenkin hyvin erilainen kuin se 1990-luvun alussa. Euroopan unioni on kehittänyt yhteistyö- ja yhdentymismekanismeja, joilla pyritään helpottamaan jäsenvaltioiden välistä yhteistyötä ja parantamaan koheesiota ja solidaarisuutta. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että yksittäisten maiden ongelmat voidaan nähdä ja käsitellä yhteisenä haasteena, joka voidaan ratkaista yhteistyön ja keskinäisen tuen avulla. Lisäksi nykypäivän Euroopassa on muita haasteita, kuten ilmastonmuutos, pakolaiskriisi, terrorismin torjunta ja yhteinen puolustus, joiden kohtaaminen vaatii toimivan eurooppalaisen politiikan, eikä yksittäisten maiden ongelmien projisointia koko Euroopan kysymyksiksi. On siis tärkeää erottaa Saksan yhdistymisen jälkeisten ongelmien konteksti ja tunnistaa erityispiirteet, jotka liittyvät ainoastaan tähän tapahtumaan. Tämän pohjalta on mahdollista kehittää todellakin yleiseurooppalainen politiikka, joka pystyy käsittelemään monenlaisia haasteita ja erilaisia kulttuureja, mutta joka myös hyödyntää kaikkien jäsenvaltioiden vahvuuksia ja potentiaalia tavoitteiden saavuttamiseksi."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She did not like her ugly colour. She was attracted by the colour of the lake near her home. It was as blue as the sky after a storm. Bluebird wanted to be the colour of that beautiful lake very much. Flapping her wings one morning, Bluebird flew from her tree to the blue lake. Then she bathed in the water three times. After each bath, she sang, \\"Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue.\\" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Now Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended  to be interested in everything she did. He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, \\"How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too.\\" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue. Convinced  that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped  and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur.

While waiting for the shower to heat up, she notices she got one cut on each of her arms. The cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable, but the one on her right arm is red and easy to see. Karen gets some cream from her cabinet to use on her cuts after she gets done showering.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Does the cut on Karen's right arm have more or less white blood cells than the cut on her left arm?  Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. The answer is:","output":"The cut on Karen's right arm has more white blood cells than the cut on her left arm. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that the cut on Karen's right arm is red and easy to see, while the cut on her left arm is hardly even noticeable. The redness and visibility of the cut on the right arm indicate that there is an inflammatory response occurring in the damaged tissue, which is a part of the body's second line of defense against pathogens. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. These chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate or expand, increasing blood flow to the damaged area and making it red and slightly warm. These are the signs that we can observe in the cut on Karen's right arm. Moreover, these chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound. Neutrophils are essential in fighting against infections and cleaning up the wound. The fact that the cut on Karen's right arm is red indicates that there is a higher presence of these inflammation-causing chemicals, which in turn signifies that there are more white blood cells in the area compared to the less noticeable cut on her left arm. In conclusion, based on the inflammatory response and the visible signs of redness associated with the cut on Karen's right arm, we can deduce that it has more white blood cells than the cut on her left arm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

China's first space lab module Tiangong-1 blasted off at 9:16 p.m. Beijing Time (1316 GMT) Thursday from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest desert area. The unmanned module, carried by Long March-2FT1 rocket, will test space docking with a spacecraft later this year, _ the way for China to become the third country in the world to operate a permanent space station around 2020. The Tiangong-1 will orbit the Earth for about one month to await Shenzhou-8 unmanned spacecraft. Once the two vehicles successfully rendezvous , they will conduct the first space docking at a height of 340 kilometers above Earth surface. After two docking tests, Tiangong-1 will await Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 in the next two years, according to a plan of China's manned space program. The 8.5-tonne Tiangong-1, with a length of 10.4 meters and maximum diameter of 3.35 meters, provides a room of 15 cubic meters for two to three astronauts to live and work. Zhang Shancong, deputy chief designer of the Tiangong-1, told Xinhua that the module carries special cameras which will take hyperspectral  images of China's vast farmlands to detect heavy metal pollution and pesticide residue as well as plant disease. Moreover, scientists on the ground will also conduct experiments on photonic crystal , a new material expected to revolutionize information technology, in the low-gravity environment inside the Tiangong-1 as these experiments would be extremely difficult to conduct on Earth's surface. \\"China is clearly becoming a global power and its investments in areas like technology and space exploration reflect this,\\" said Peter Singer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. \\"It is a natural result of the growth in political and economic power and is to be expected,\\" said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space program,...

Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released  the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation.

UPDATED:. 06:34 EST, 23 December 2013. A mother whose 13-year-old daughter was declared brain dead after what should have been a routine tonsillectomy says she cannot bring herself to take her daughter off life support. Nailah Winkfield of Oakland, California, has pleaded for prayers and time to keep her daughter, Jahi McMath, on a ventilator past Monday, when a temporary restraining order barring a hospital from disconnecting life support expires. ‘They have been pressuring me to “pull the plug”,’ Winkfield wrote in an open letter released this weekend. ‘I can't. I won't. I can't let them kill my baby a second time.’ Loss: Jahi McMath, 13, suffered cardiac arrest after having her tonsils out and has been declared brain dead. A decision is expected on Monday regarding her future. ‘Despite what they say, she is alive. I can touch her, she is warm. She responds to my touch. Given time I know (God) will spark her brain awake.’ Children's Hospital of Oakland's responded in a statement that while it sympathizes with Winkfield's wishes, ‘it would be unfair to give false hope that Jahi will come back to life.’ Jahi was admitted to hospital on December 9 to undergoing a ‘simple procedure’ to remove her tonsil to help with her sleep apnea. But the girl suffered complications and began bleeding profusely from her nose and mouth for hours, Winkfield said. Devastated: Nailah Winkfield (center), mother of Jahi McMath pictured on Friday awaiting the verdict of a court decision about the future of her daughter. McMath then went into cardiac arrest, and was revived by doctors, only for them to declare that she was brain dead on December 12. The hospital statement contends the surgery was complicated, and that it was committed to fully investigating what caused ‘this catastrophic outcome.’ A judge ruled on Friday to keep Jahi on a ventilator and continue giving her intravenous fluids through to Monday, when a court-approved neurologist will examine the girl for any signs of brain activity. The family's attorney, Christopher Dolan, told Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo the family wanted independent tests because they do not believe the hospital's physicians are sufficiently independent. The hospital said in documents presented to the court on Friday that a staff neurologist and Jahi's attending physician conducted separated exams, both of which determined that Jahi's entire brain, including her brain stem, stopped functioning. Ruling: Nailah Winkfield's daughter will be evaluated by an independent doctor on Monday and then a decision on her future will be taken. ‘There is absolutely no medical possibility that (Jahi's) condition is reversible or that she will someday recover from death,’ declarations from the doctors said. ‘Thus, there is no medical justification to provide any further medical treatment whatsoever to (her).’ The family told ABC station KGO-TV in San Francisco they will hold a march and rally Monday at 9:30 a.m. PT outside the hospital. They said the rally will be peaceful and lawful. 'Jahi's favorite color is purple. So if you can come out wearing a purple shirt, it doesn't matter what shade it is. But if you have a purple shirt, please wear it and march with us Monday morning,' McMaths's uncle, Omari Sealey, said. Winkfield told KGO-TV on Friday she was grateful just to have three more days with her daughter. 'It is hard because I feel like I'm just on borrowed time with my daughter,' Winkfield said. 'I will fight for my daughter until I can't fight anymore and I don't know when a mother loses a fight for her children.' United front: Nailah Winkfield (center), Jahi's uncle, Omari Sealey (far left) and their attorney said they wanted to hospital to keep the girl on the ventilator indefinitely. After her daughter underwent a. supposedly routine tonsillectomy and was moved to a recovery room,. Nailah Winkfield began to fear something was going horribly wrong. Jahi was sitting up in bed, her hospital gown bloody, and holding a pink cup full of blood. 'Is this normal?' Winkfield repeatedly asked nurses. With. her family and hospital staff trying to help and comfort her, Jahi kept. bleeding profusely for the next few hours then went into cardiac. arrest, her mother said. In an interview at. Children's Hospital Oakland on Thursday night, Winkfield described the. nightmarish turn of events after her daughter underwent tonsil removal. surgery to help with her sleep apnea. She said that even before. the surgery, her daughter had expressed fears that she wouldn't wake up. after the operation. To everyone's relief, she appeared alert, was. talking and even ate a Popsicle afterward. Beloved: Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield has said that she believes God will 'spark her brain awake' Apprehensive: Jahi was nervous about undergoing surgery but her mother assured her she'd be fine. As she was recovering, she was bleeding from the mouth and nose and suffered cardiac arrest. But about a half-hour. later, shortly after the girl was taken to the intensive care unit, she. began bleeding from her mouth and nose despite efforts by hospital staff. and her family. While the bleeding continued, Jahi wrote her. mother notes. In one, the girl asked to have her nose wiped because she. felt it running. Her mother said she didn't want to scare her daughter. by saying it was blood. 'My. daughter had actual clots sliding out of her mouth and they gave me a. cup and said, \\"Here, catch them with the cup so we can measure them,\\"' Winkfield told ABC 7. Family members said there were containers. of Jahi's blood in the room, and hospital staff members were providing. transfusions to counteract the blood loss. 'I don't know what a. tonsillectomy is supposed to look like after you have it, but that blood. was un-normal for anything,' Winkfield said. The family said hospital officials told them in a meeting Thursday that they want to take the girl off life support quickly. 'I just looked at the doctor to his face and I told him you better not touch her,' Winkfield recalled. The. family filed a request Friday for a temporary restraining order. prohibiting the hospital from taking Jahi off life support or any of her. other current treatment. Speaking to CNN's Piers Morgan Tuesday night, Nailah Winkfield said she believed her daughter could still wake up. 'I. don't want to take my daughter off life support because I love my. child,' an emotional Winkfield said. 'When I walked her into that. hospital, she was perfectly fine, there was nothing wrong with her. She. had no health problems. 'As long as she has a pulse, we want her on life support,' Sealey said. 'We want her to come home for Christmas. We want to give her presents. We want a chance for a Christmas miracle.'

Media playback is not supported on this device Thomas O'Ware's header and strikes by Denny Johnstone and Ross Forbes ensured Alan Stubbs' side remain eight points behind Championship leaders Rangers. Jim Duffy's visitors, meanwhile, moved to within a point of the promotion play-off places. Jason Cummings had Hibs' best chances, including a close-range header in the first half. Few saw the result coming with Morton having last won a league game at Easter Road in 1982. Stubbs made seven changes from the side that beat Alloa Athletic on Sunday; but Lewis Stevenson kept his place and was made captain, playing his 300th game for the club under his eighth manager. Duffy gave a debut to Celtic loanee Paul McMullan, who had been with St Mirren earlier this season. Before the match, Stubbs said the fixture came under the 'must-win' category, and from the kick-off his players seemed to be underlining his message, taking the game to the Greenock side. The passing was slick, they were patient in possession and Hibs came close on a number of occasions in the early stages through Kevin Thomson with a sizzling shot, Cummings with a header and two inventive efforts from Stokes. John McGinn even netted, only to be judged offside, and there was a ridiculous miss from Cummings when he nodded past the post from around two yards out. But Morton weathered all of that and began to create their own pressure. Mark Oxley had to produce an alert piece of goalkeeping following an O'Ware header and it became clear that, from the home side's perspective, the evening may not be quite as straightforward as some might have imagined. Their fears were confirmed when Forbes' whipped corner from the right was met by a courageous header by O'Ware, who attacked a crowded area and forced the ball home. Easter Road, bar for 100 or so joyous travellers from Greenock, was silenced. Suddenly it was all change. Morton looked energetic and creative, Hibernian nervous and predictable. They looked like they craved the half-time advice of their manager. But whatever Stubbs said had no effect. In fact it went from bad to worse when Morton doubled their lead shortly after Stokes claimed unsuccessfully for a penalty following a challenge by Forbes. Declan McManus delivered a hopeful cross and Oxley made a dreadful hash of dealing with it, spilling to the feet of Johnstone. It was a tap-in job and Hibs were deep in trouble. Bobby Barr thundered down Morton's left on the counter-attack and delivered a telling pass for Forbes to produce a sweeping finish into Oxley's net. It rounded off a stunning performance by the visitors and one which left the Hibs fans looking on in disbelief. Summary:","output":"Thomas O'Ware's header and goals from Denny Johnstone and Ross Forbes helped Morton beat Hibernian in a soccer game, which surprised many people because Morton hadn't won a league game at Easter Road since 1982."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Write a fact related to the given fact, based on the given topic word.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   RNA is studied to understand gene expression patterns in cells. RNA is naturally very unstable because enzymes that break down RNA are commonly present in nature. Some are even secreted by our own skin and are very difficult to inactivate. Similar to DNA extraction, RNA extraction involves the use of various buffers and enzymes to inactivate other macromolecules and preserve only the RNA. Gel Electrophoresis Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or alkaline pH in an aqueous environment, they can be moved by an electric field. Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate charged molecules on the basis of size and charge. The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or as fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot at one end of a gel matrix, an electric current is applied, and negatively charged molecules are pulled toward the opposite end of the gel (the end with the positive electrode). Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. The nucleic acids in a gel matrix are invisible until they are stained with a compound that allows them to be seen, such as a dye. Distinct fragments of nucleic acids appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) that are based on their size (Figure 10.3). A mixture of many fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many million pounds did the cottun spun increase between 1781 and 1800?","output":"Title: The Explosion of Cotton Spinning in Britain: A Significant Increase from 1781 to 1800  Introduction The late 18th century was a period of rapid industrial growth, innovation, and social change. It marked the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, a time when textile production, among other industries, experienced exceptional transformations resulting in increased economic development. In Britain, the rise of mechanized cotton spinning played a pivotal role in driving this economic progress. This article will delve into just one aspect of this story – the dramatic increase in the amount of cotton spun between 1781 and 1800 – to help shed light on the broader picture of this remarkable period in history. The Significance of Cotton The importance of cotton as a textile material cannot be understated. As a versatile, soft, and easily-dyed fiber, it was the ideal candidate for mass production. Demand for cotton cloth grew rapidly across Europe, and in Britain, it played an integral role in the economy and the Industrial Revolution. Cotton Spinning Innovation: Key Technologies During the 18th century, technological advancements were the driving force behind the revolution in textile manufacturing. Two key inventions, the spinning jenny and the water frame, radically altered the way cotton was spun, leading to a significant increase in the volume of its production. Invented by James Hargreaves in 1764, the spinning jenny mechanized the process of spinning cotton, allowing a single worker to operate multiple spindles simultaneously. This invention dramatically increased productivity. The water frame, patented by Richard Arkwright in 1769, improved upon the spinning jenny by implementing water power to spin cotton, resulting in stronger and finer yarn. The Increase in Cotton Production: Quantifying the Growth With these machinery innovations in place, the volume of cotton spun in Britain experienced a staggering growth between 1781 and 1800. Quantifying this growth in terms of million pounds can be done by examining historical records and statistical estimation.  According to economic historian Nick Harley, the amount of raw cotton spun in British mills was approximately 10.5 million pounds in 1781. By 1800, this figure had grown to an estimated 110.6 million pounds. This represents an increase of about 100.1 million pounds during this 19-year period. It is worth mentioning that these numbers are approximate, and different sources might provide slightly varying figures. Nonetheless, the overall trend of phenomenal growth remains evident. Factors Contributing to the Growth This exponential growth in cotton spinning can be attributed to several factors: 1. Technological advancements: As mentioned earlier, inventions like the spinning jenny and water frame significantly increased the efficiency of cotton production. 2. Availability of raw materials: The expansion of British colonies led to increased imports of raw cotton, primarily from American plantations. This ensured a steady supply of cotton for British mills. 3. Labor supply: The rural population in Britain was rapidly urbanizing due to enclosures and agricultural changes, creating an abundant workforce for the growing cotton industry. 4. Investment and financing: The rising demand for cotton products led to increased investment in the textile industry, both in terms of capital and financing. This enabled the industry to expand and meet the growing needs of the market. Conclusion The period between 1781 and 1800 witnessed a stupendous growth in cotton spinning in Britain, with an estimated increase of around 100.1 million pounds. This growth was driven by technological advancements, the availability of raw materials, an abundant labor force, and increased investment. It was a vital catalyst in Britain's economic development and a key factor in the success of the Industrial Revolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: [893, 406, 55, -312, -50] A:","output":"To perform this task, I will iterate through each number in the list and apply a rounding mechanism to each number accordingly. Numbers in Python are rounded up if the unit digit is 5 or more, and rounded down if it is less than 5. This rule applies to both positive and negative numbers. Also, since -50 is already a multiple of 10, it would remain unchanged. Let's start this process for the given list [893, 406, 55, -312, -50]. 1. The first number is 893, the unit digit of 893 is 3 which is less than 5, so it should be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10 which is 890.  2. The second number is 406, the unit digit of 406 is 6 which is more than 5, so it should be rounded up to its nearest multiple of 10, which is 410. 3. The third number is 55, the unit digit of 55 is 5, according to the rule, a number is rounded up when its unit digit is 5 or more, so 55 should be rounded up to 60. 4. The fourth number is -312, the unit digit of -312 is 2 which is less than 5. For negative numbers also the same rule is used. In other words, we consider the value of the unit digit irrespective of the sign. Hence, -312 should be rounded down to its nearest multiple of 10, which is -310. 5. The fifth number is -50, -50 is already a multiple of 10 so it does not need to be rounded to a different tens place. We leave it as -50 itself. So, the list [893, 406, 55, -312, -50] when rounded to the nearest tens places becomes [890, 410, 60, -310, -50]."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If little things are bothering you and you shove them down, they are just going to turn into an explosion at a bad time. If you deal with them as they happen, it won't be as big of a deal. If you find yourself starting a discussion while angry or getting angry while in the middle of a discussion, you may need to spend some time calming down. You know what calms you down. Maybe you need to take a short walk, listen to some music, or take a relaxing shower. You can also try counting to ten or taking a few deep breathes. Whatever you need to do, take a few minutes to calm down before continuing the discussion. Look for warning signs. If you find yourself feeling like you absolutely must win an argument, it's time to take a break. At that point, you're likely to say something you regret or keep the argument going long past the point that it's wise to do so. When you're angry, you're just thinking about how you've been wronged. However, as soon as you start forcing yourself to think about what the other person is going through, you start to pull yourself out of that mindset. Being empathetic can help drain your anger. It's important to respect what your partner is feeling, as he or she has a right to feel and express his or her emotions, whatever they are. Whether or not you think your partner is right about the problem, you should still validate what the person is feeling. Listening to what the other person has to say can help you develop empathy for what he or she is feeling. Don't just let the words pass over you. Actually think about what the person is saying, and maybe try to understand what is behind the words, as well.  One way to show you are listening is to try to summarize what the other person is saying. For example, you can say, \\"What I hear you saying is you get frustrated when you do more than your share of the housework.\\" Another way to show you're listening is to ask relevant follow-up questions to make sure you understand what the other person is saying. You also have a right to discuss what you're feeling and thinking. The key is to keep a calm head. It's also important to be clear about what you're thinking and feeling. You can't expect your partner to read your mind when it comes to your thoughts and emotions.  Keep to talking about what you think about the problem, rather than placing blame. In other words, start with \\"I\\" instead of \\"You.\\" For instance, you could say \\"I get anxious when the house isn't clean. Can we work on making a schedule for house cleaning so we can stay on top of it?\\" instead of \\"You never clean house with me!\\" The key to any relationship is learning to compromise. You can't just expect to win every argument, as relationships involve give and take. Compromising is about finding common ground and both of you giving a little on the issue.   Discuss your needs and wants.  If you can decide on what both you need, you can give a little in the \\"wants\\" section. Basically, you need to decide what areas are least and most important to you and learn to give in the areas that aren't as important. If you hate cleaning the bathroom but your spouse wants you to help out around the house more, maybe you can divide chores into ones you find more tolerable and ones he or she finds more tolerable. When you're arguing, it's tempting to name-call or make unfair remarks that drag up the past. You know how to push your partner's buttons because you know him or her so well. However, all that will serve to do is make everyone angrier, and may even damage the relationship irrevocably. Keep to the task at hand.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of addressing issues as they arise, staying calm during discussions, practicing empathy and active listening, expressing one's own feelings clearly, compromising, and avoiding harmful communication tactics to maintain healthy relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","output":"(A). Yes Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"Walking into a store and seeing all the available options can be overwhelming.\\" can be considered true. The speaker clearly states that they feel overwhelmed when they walk into a store with numerous choices and options. This can be supported by several details in the text that relay a sense of being overwhelmed. For instance, the speaker says, \\"you walk into a store and you just like you said you're overwhelmed by how much there is.\\" This statement not only directly uses the word \\"overwhelmed\\" but also demonstrates how the sheer amount of available options creates confusion or feelings of being overwhelmed. Additionally, the speaker mentions that they \\"don't know if you're like me,\\" which implies that this feeling of being overwhelmed could be a personal preference or opinion. Regardless, the inclusion of this phrase allows for the possibility that others share the same perception, making the hypothesis even more valid. The speaker also acknowledges that they may have a different experience compared to the person they are talking to who is \\"much more voracious in terms of how much reading you're doing obviously.\\" This statement highlights that personal preferences and habits can influence the feeling of being overwhelmed or not. However, it does not negate the hypothesis, as it simply showcases variations in personal experiences. Therefore, based on these points, the hypothesis \\"Walking into a store and seeing all the available options can be overwhelming\\" can be considered true for the speaker and possibly for others who share the same experience or sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So graceful, yet so powerful, their movements synchronized even as they swam their separate courses. Dara had been a competitive swimmer for most of her life, beginning her training when she was just a child. Now, as a dedicated athlete in her early twenties, the water was as much her home as any other place. Her slender form, toned muscles, and the incredible ease with which she navigated each lap were a testament to the countless hours spent honing her craft. He knew first-hand that swimming with such grace and fluidity was anything but effortless. The countless hours of practice, the muscle soreness after exhausting workouts, and the mental discipline required to keep pushing one's limits had all yielded extraordinary results in her case. Drew, on the other hand, was not a professional swimmer like Dara. Although he couldn't match her exceptional skill and speed, he was quite a good swimmer in his own right. His strength and endurance were impressive, and other swimmers at the pool often admired his dedication and determination. He had initially picked up swimming as a hobby and a means to keep fit, but soon found himself drawn to it with a zeal he had never before experienced. Watching athletes like Dara in action, he couldn't help but push himself harder, striving for even a fraction of their prowess. As he pulled his goggles over his eyes and dove in, he felt the familiar rush of excitement course through him. The water enveloped him, shutting out the rest of the world and leaving only the quiet, muted space beneath the surface. With powerful kicks and sweeping arms, Drew propelled himself forward, feeling the water rush across his skin, hair, and muscles. Gliding far underwater, and surfacing in a smooth freestyle, Drew found himself in his element, letting himself be carried away by the rhythm of his strokes. Dara, who heard someone enter the water, spared a glance in his direction, recognizing Drew. She offered a brief smile of acknowledgement and encouragement before continuing with her own workout. Lap by lap, they crossed and recrossed the pool, their respect for one another growing with each passing stroke. Despite their differing skill levels, a silent camaraderie formed between them, born from their shared love for swimming. They challenged each other, silently pushing one another to be their best selves, adding to the already electric atmosphere of the pool. As they continued their workout, the two swimmers reveled in the athletic pursuit that united them, the water becoming a common ground for their shared passion. The connection between them extended beyond the pool, their friendship strengthened by the respect and understanding they found in each other's company. In their own unique ways, they both found solace, drive, and purpose within the graceful world of swimming, forever bound by the seemingly effortless dance they performed through the water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of turning on an HP laptop, follow these detailed steps: 1. Ensure the laptop is adequately charged or connected to a power source: Before turning on the laptop, check if it has enough battery charge to function properly. HP laptops typically have a battery indicator on the side or front of the device, which can give an idea of the battery life. If the battery is dead, connect the laptop to a power source using the charger provided with your laptop. Plug the charger into a wall outlet and connect the other end to the laptop's charging port. 2. Locate the power button: The power button varies in appearance and location depending on the model of your HP laptop. Usually, it is a circular or rectangular shape button with a symbol that resembles a circle with a vertical line through the top. The button is commonly found on the top-right or left side near the keyboard, on the hinge between the screen and the keyboard, or on the side of the laptop. 3. Turn on the laptop: Press the power button firmly for a brief second and then release. You should see the laptop's power indicator light up and hear the fans and hard drive start to function. If you don't notice any of these signs, ensure your laptop is connected to a power source or has enough battery charge to power on. 4. Wait for the startup process: After pressing the power button, the HP logo should appear on the laptop screen, followed by the Windows or your chosen operating system's startup screen. The startup process may take a few seconds to a minute to complete, depending on your laptop's specifications and installed software. 5. Log in to your account: Once the startup process is complete, you may need to log in to your user account. If your HP laptop has a password or PIN set up, enter it when prompted. Some newer HP laptops may also have biometric authentication options like facial recognition or a fingerprint scanner, which can be used to log in faster if you have set up these features. 6. Troubleshoot if necessary: If your HP laptop does not turn on even after following the above steps, some potential issues could be contributing to the problem. These may include a damaged power button, a faulty charger, battery issues, or software-related problems. In such cases, visit the HP support website or reach out to their customer service department for further assistance. Turning on an HP laptop should be a straightforward process once you locate the power button and ensure the laptop has a functional battery or power source. In case of any issues or complications, always consult the laptop user manual or contact HP support for help."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court ruled Monday morning in favor of a death row inmate in a case concerning race discrimination in jury selection.      Timothy Tyrone Foster, an African-American, is on death row in Georgia for the 1987 murder of an elderly white woman, Queen Madge White. The jury that convicted him was all white. Twenty years after his sentence his attorneys obtained notes the prosecution team took while it was engaged in picking a jury, including marking potential jurors who were black had a \\"b\\" written by their name.      \\"The focus on race in the prosecution's file plainly demonstrates a concerted effort to keep black prospective jurors off the jury,\\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas was the only dissenter.      The decision does not vacate Foster's conviction; it opens the door for Foster to go back to the Georgia state court and argue for a new trial.      The case is likely to cause other inmates across the country with similar claims to come forward and to seek a new trial.      Monday's ruling can provide \\"new life to these so-called Batson claims in the lower courts and the issue of racial bias in jury selection,\\" said Steve Vladeck, CNN contributor and law professor at American University Washington College of Law, referring to the 1986 case Batson v. Kentucky.      Foster's lawyers argued the notes reflect the fact the prosecution illegally took race into consideration as it struck every potential black juror. Georgia argued the notes reflect the prosecutors were simply preparing themselves for a racial bias challenge.      \\"The State's new argument today does not dissuade us from the conclusion that its prosecutors were motivated in substantial part by race,\\" Roberts wrote.      \\"Two peremptory strikes on the basis of race are two more than the Constitution allows,\\" he added.      \\"This discrimination became apparent only because we obtained the prosecution's notes which revealed their intent to discriminate. Usually that does not happen,\\" said Foster's lead lawyer, Stephen Bright, from the Southern Center of Human Rights. \\"The practice of discriminating in striking juries continues in courtrooms across the country. Usually courts ignore patterns of race discrimination and accept false reasons for the strikes.\\"      Thomas dissent      In his dissent, Thomas argued that the court didn't have the power to review the Georgia state court decision. Thomas also said he believed the Supreme Court owed more deference to the lower court's ruling that prosecutors had race-neutral reasons for striking specific jurors.      In his view, \\"The Court today invites state prisoners to go searching for new 'evidence' by demanding the files of the prosecutors who long ago convicted them . ...I cannot go along with that 'sort of sandbagging of state courts.' New evidence should not justify the relitigation of Batson claims,\\" Thomas wrote.      \\"Even in the face of overwhelming evidence of racial bias on the part of the prosecutors, Justice Thomas still would have deferred to the state court's conclusion that there was no unconstitutional discrimination,\\" Vladeck said.      \\"The notion that, as Justice Thomas suggested, it is 'flabbergasting' that newly discovered evidence could prove racial bias on the part of prosecutors is itself flabbergasting, especially given the facts of this case, and an alarmingly deferential view for a Supreme Court justice to take,\\" Vladeck added.      What the prosecutor's notes showed      White was a 79-year-old retired elementary school teacher who lived alone. In court papers, the state said Foster \\"broke her jaw, coated her face with talcum powder, sexually molested her with a salad-dressing bottle and strangled her to death.\\"      Nearly 20 years after the conviction, through an open records request, Foster's lawyers obtained the notes the prosecution team took while it was engaged in the process of picking a jury.      Foster's lawyers said the notes reflect that the prosecution illegally took race into consideration as it struck every potential black juror.      \\"We have an arsenal of smoking guns in this case,\\" Bright told the justices at oral arguments.      \\"The prosecutors in this case came to court on the morning of jury selection determined to strike all the black prospective jurors,\\" Bright said. \\"Blacks were taken out of the picture here, they were taken and dealt with separately.\\"      Beth A. Burton, Georgia's Deputy Attorney General told the justices that the prosecutors at the time were anticipating future challenges from Foster's team and that is why they highlighted information concerning black jurors and prepared race-neutral explanations for the strikes.      The notes, released in court filings, were taken as the legal teams prepared to pick a jury. Each side was granted \\"peremptory challenges\\" that allowed them to dismiss potential jurors without explanation. But Supreme Court precedent -- reaffirmed in 1986 -- says, however, that jurors cannot be struck because of their race.      In the Foster case, the state and the defense used their peremptory strikes to reduce the pool to 12 jurors and four alternates. The state struck the four black potential jurors.      One set of documents from the prosecution files shows that potential jurors who were black had a \\"B\\" written by their name and their names highlighted with a green pen. On some juror questionnaire sheets, the juror's race \\"black,\\" \\"color\\" or \\"negro\\" was circled. One juror, Eddie Hood, was labeled \\"B #1. Others were labeled B#2, and B#3.      Another set of the prosecution notes contains a coded key to identify race. There is a list of six \\"definite no's\\" --the top five are black.      The Supreme Court's 1986 case held that once a defendant has produced enough evidence to raise an inference that the state impermissibly excluded a juror based on race, the state must come forward with a race-neutral explanation for the exclusion.      According to Bright, the states' race-neutral justifications didn't hold up. For example, the prosecution said one reason it struck a 34-year-old black woman was that she was near the age of Foster. ||||| Overview      Equal Protection refers to the idea that a governmental body may not deny people equal protection of its governing laws. The governing body state must treat an individual in the same manner as others in similar conditions and circumstances.      Permissible Discrimination      Before proceeding, it is important to remember that a government is allowed to discriminate against individuals, as long as the discrimination satisfies the equal protection analysis outlined below, and described in full detail in this Santa Clara Law Review article.      U.S. Constitution      The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause requires the United States government to practice equal protection. The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause requires states to practice equal protection.      Equal protection forces a state to govern impartially—not draw distinctions between individuals solely on differences that are irrelevant to a legitimate governmental objective. Thus, the equal protection clause is crucial to the protection of civil rights.      Equal Protection Analysis      When an individual believes that either the federal government or a state government has violated that individual's guaranteed equal rights, that individual is able to bring a lawsuit against that governmental body for relief.      Based on the type of discrimination alleged, the individual will first need to prove that the governing body actually discriminated against the individual. The individual will need to prove that the governing body's action resulted in an actual harm to the individual. After proving this, the court will typically scrutinize the governmental action in one of several three ways to determine whether the governmental body's action is permissible: these three methods are referred to as strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis scrutiny. The court will determine which scrutiny the individual will be subject to, relying on legal precedent to determine which level of scrutiny to use. It is important to note that courts have combined elements of two of the three tests to create an ad hoc test.

(Associated Press) In this undated photo made available by the Georgia Department of Corrections, shows Timothy Tyrone Foster. The Supreme Court has thrown out a death sentence handed to Foster because prosecutors improperly... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled decisively in favor of a death-row inmate in Georgia on Monday, chastising state prosecutors for improperly keeping African-Americans off the jury that convicted him of killing a white woman.      The justices ruled 7-1 in favor of death row inmate Timothy Tyrone Foster in underscoring the importance of rules they laid out in 1986 to prevent racial discrimination in the selection of juries.      Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court that Georgia \\"prosecutors were motivated in substantial part by race\\" when they struck African-Americans from the jury pool.      But the court did nothing to limit peremptory strikes, lawyers' ability to reject potential jurors without offering any reason. The late Thurgood Marshall once said that racial discrimination would persist in jury selection unless peremptory strikes were curtailed.      The outcome probably will enable Foster to win a new trial, 29 years after he was sentenced to death.      Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, saying he would have respected the decisions of state judges who sided with prosecutors and rejected Foster's claims.      When the case was argued in November, the justices did little to hide their distaste for the tactics employed by prosecutors in north Georgia. Justice Elena Kagan said the case seemed as clear a violation \\"as a court is ever going to see.\\"      Still, Georgia courts had consistently rejected Foster's claims of discrimination, even after his lawyers obtained the prosecution's notes that revealed prosecutors' focus on the black people in the jury pool. In one example, a handwritten note headed \\"Definite No's\\" listed six people, of whom five were the remaining black prospective jurors.      The sixth person on the list was a white woman who made clear she would never impose the death penalty, according to Foster's lawyer, Stephen Bright. And yet even that woman ranked behind the black jurors, Bright said.      The court was not persuaded by the state's argument that the notes focused on black people in the jury pool because prosecutors were preparing to defend against discrimination claims. The Supreme Court's ruling about race discrimination in jury selection was about a year old when Foster's case went to trial, the state said. The 1986 decision in Batson v. Kentucky set up a system by which trial judges could evaluate claims of discrimination and the explanations by prosecutors that their actions were not based on race.      \\"This argument falls flat,\\" Roberts wrote. He noted that the record shows \\"a concerted effort to keep black prospective jurors off the jury.\\"      Foster's trial lawyers did not so much contest his guilt as try to explain it as a product of a troubled childhood, drug abuse and mental illness. They also raised their objections about the exclusion of African-Americans from the jury. On that point, the judge accepted prosecutor Stephen Lanier's explanations that factors other than race drove his decisions. The jury convicted Foster and sentenced him to death.      The jury issue was revived 19 years later, in 2006, when the state turned over the prosecution's notes in response to a request under Georgia's Open Records Act.      The name of each potential black juror was highlighted on four different copies of the jury list and the word \\"black\\" was circled next to the race question on questionnaires for the black prospective jurors. Three of the prospective black jurors were identified in notes as \\"B#1,\\" ''B#2,\\" and \\"B#3.\\"      An investigator working for the prosecutors also ranked the black prospective jurors against each other in case \\"it comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors.\\" ||||| A Supreme Court case about juries may not sound like the most exciting legal battle of all time. But in Foster v. Chatman, the Supreme Court's decision on how juries work could have a big impact on issues that are definitely getting a lot of attention in America today — mainly, the death penalty and the racism in the criminal justice system.      On Monday, the Supreme Court effectively refused to weaken a legal rule that makes it harder for prosecutors to stuff juries with exclusively white jurors. In a 7-1 decision, the Court found that Georgia prosecutors really had purposely targeted black jurors to keep them off a trial with a black defendant, and that such a move was unconstitutional. \\"[T]he focus on race in the prosecution’s file plainly demonstrates a concerted effort to keep black prospective jurors off the jury,\\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the ruling.      The case has some grisly beginnings: Timothy Tyrone Foster, a black man, is accused of killing a 79-year-old white woman in Georgia when he was 18 in 1986. A jury found him guilty, and sentenced him to death.      But the jury that convicted Foster was all white. That's not because the jury pool was all white to begin with, but because prosecutors used what are called \\"peremptory strikes\\" to get 100 percent of the black potential jurors originally involved in the case removed from the jury. In comparison, 16 percent of white potential jurors were taken off the case, Lyle Denniston reported for SCOTUSblog.      Foster's defense argued the all-white makeup of the jury altered the outcome of the trial. Armed with evidence taken directly from prosecutor's notes, the defense claimed the ruling against Foster was based on race-based discrimination, violating a previous standard set by the Supreme Court for juries. The Supreme Court sided with Foster, arguing that the prosecution had clearly based its jury selection decisions on race.      On its face, then, Foster v. Chatman may seem like a merely procedural case about juries. But by upholding a legal safeguard against racism in the justice system, the case's impact could extend far beyond Foster (who may be retried as a result of the decision), potentially reverberating across a criminal justice system that many argue — and statistics show — is racially biased.      How Foster v. Chatman ended up at the Supreme Court      Despite its broader implications, Foster v. Chatman was really a case about legal procedure.      Foster was tried, convicted, and sentenced by an all-white jury. But the jury didn't start white — instead ending up that way after prosecutors used what are their peremptory strikes to get black potential jurors removed from consideration.      Unlike other methods for removing jurors, peremptory strikes are deployed without providing any justification. So in theory, a prosecutor can have someone removed from the jury for no particular reason. The big limitation is that prosecutors have a limited number of peremptory strikes to use.      But throughout history, prosecutors used these strikes to remove black potential jurors from juries. The idea: Black jurors are more likely to sympathize with black defendants, so getting them removed from a trial would make a conviction more likely. (Some research backs this up. More on that later.)      On top of being unconstitutional, the practice had the clear effect of making criminal justice racially skewed, since some of the biggest potential allies of black people accused of crimes were being taken out of the jury box. So in 1986, the Supreme Court laid out clear standards to stop the use of race-based peremptory strikes — in the landmark decision of Batson v. Kentucky.      Denniston explained for SCOTUSblog the three-step process set by the Supreme Court to prevent the use of race in peremptory strikes:      First, the accused has to show membership in a specific racial group, and make the point that prosecutors had used their peremptory strikes to preclude all or most members of that race from serving as jurors. Second, it is then up to prosecutors to offer non-racial reasons for using those strikes. Third, the task falls to the trial judge to decide whether, taking everything into account, the defense lawyers had succeeded in showing that prosecutors had intentionally kept minority jurors from serving because of their race, despite prosecutors' attempts to provide race-neutral explanations.      These standards are not perfect. As Dara Lind previously explained for Vox, prosecutors have long used tricks to get around them. But they at least shield from some racial bias in the justice system — and the possibility that these standards could be weakened alarmed many racial justice advocates and criminal justice reformers.      In Foster v. Chatman, Foster's defense argued that the courts failed to follow the process. The trial court and Georgia Supreme Court rejected the claims, but the Supreme Court agreed to hear the challenge. And the Supreme Court then sided against the lower courts, ruling that prosecutors really did engage in a concerted effort to keep black people out of the jury box.      The defense has a big piece of evidence: the prosecution's notes, obtained through a Georgia open records law. In the notes, prosecutors highlighted black would-be jurors' names, circled \\"black\\" where it was marked on questionnaires to show the potential juror's race, and dubbed the black jurors \\"B#1,\\" \\"B#2,\\" and \\"B#3.\\" They also ranked the potential black jurors, preparing for the situation in which \\"it comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors.\\"      Then there's the statistics: 100 percent of black would-be jurors were removed from the trial, while only 16 percent of white would-be jurors were. And when prosecutors asked for the death penalty, they said it would \\"deter other people out there in the projects\\" — language that's quite obviously racially charged.      This all seemed like a very clear violation of the standard set up in Batson. Justice Elena Kagan noted as much during the trial hearings, saying the notes are evidence \\"as clear a Batson violation as this court is ever going to see.\\"      The prosecution disagreed, providing detailed reasons for excluding the black potential jurors in its brief — for example, that they struck would-be jurors with sons who were Foster's age and potential jurors with cousins who were arrested. Whether those are valid reasons — a juror might not have any real connection with a cousin, for one — is up for debate, but the prosecution said they're race-neutral justifications.      The Supreme Court rejected the prosecution's defense. The Court argued that prosecutors had clearly targeted black jurors in at least two cases. And although the prosecution claimed that it used race-neutral characteristics for peremptory strikes, the characteristics it cited were only applied to black would-be jurors — even though some white prospective juror shared some of the characteristics — in what appeared to be clearly racially motivated.      \\"The State’s new argument today does not dissuade us from the conclusion that its prosecutors were motivated in substantial part by race when they struck Garrett and Hood from the jury 30 years ago,\\" Chief Justice Roberts wrote. \\"Two peremptory strikes on the basis of race are two more than the Constitution allows.\\"      The case is obviously important for Foster's fate, but it also may have consequences for the criminal justice system more broadly — a system that's troubled by enormous racial disparities. By ensuring that a key safeguard against racism in the justice system remains in place and unweakened, the Supreme Court is at least trying to make sure that racial disparities at least don't get worse.      America's criminal justice system is very racially skewed      While Foster v. Chatman may seem like one case about one murder, it is really about a standard that acts as one of the few major safeguards to the massive racial disparities in the criminal justice system.      It is no secret that America's criminal justice system is racially skewed. For example, black people are also much more likely to be arrested for drugs, even though they're not more likely to use or sell drugs. And when black defendants are convicted for drug offenses, they get longer sentences for the same crimes: A 2012 report from the US Sentencing Commission found that drug trafficking sentences for black men were 13.1 percent longer than those for white men between 2007 and 2009.      The same disparities apply to capital punishment, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center: Black people make up about 13 percent of the general population, but they make up about 35 percent of people executed since 1976, the year the death penalty was reinstated in the US. And when someone is executed, it's much more likely that the victim was white: White, non-Hispanic Americans are about 62 percent of the US population, but about 76 percent of executions involved victims who were white.      Jurors can act as one way to safeguard against these disparities, because the research shows that diverse juries are much more likely to be sympathetic to black defendants.      A 2007 study by Samuel Sommers of Tufts University found that race plays a major role in juries. In a review of the research, Sommers found that white juries tend to be harder on black defendants than diverse juries. Sommers raised several explanations for this, including a theory that the mere presence of black jurors may make it harder for white jurors to express prejudice.      But Sommers also found that jurors don't seem to possess racial bias in cases that are racially charged. Still, in cases that don't bring up blatant racial issues, white jurors are much harder on black defendants than on white ones.      Researchers Shamena Anwar, Patrick Bayer and Randi Hjalmarsson put this idea to the test by studying different cases in Florida. They found all-white juries were much more likely — by 16 percentage points — to convict a black defendant over a white one.      It's hard to say what the exact difference is between white and black jurors' mindsets. But intuitively, it makes sense that people would empathize more with someone who looks and is more like them, and perhaps that leads to more reasonable doubt against a prosecutor's case. Furthermore, subconscious racial biases — known as implicit bias — are more likely to color white jurors' judgments.      Again, the Batson standards aren't perfect, and prosecutors have ways to get around them in some cases. But they're at least something.      Ultimately, this is the potential impact of Foster v. Chatman: If Batson hadn't applied in a case in which the prosecutors were so clearly racially motivated in how they struck out jurors, then it's hard to imagine how Batson could apply in any case. So by refusing to weaken the Batson standard through Foster's case, the Supreme Court has made it potentially more difficult for future prosecutors to act in clearly racially biased ways. ||||| Facts:      When selecting a jury, both parties may remove potential jurors using an unlimited number of challenges for cause (e.g., stated reasons such as bias) and a limited number of peremptory challenges (i.e., do not need to state a reason).      At the trial of James Kirkland Batson for burglary and receipt of stolen goods, the prosecutor used his peremptory challenges to remove all four African Americans from the jury pool. Batson challenged the removal of these jurors as violating his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The jury convicted petitioner on both counts.      On appeal, the Supreme Court of Kentucky affirmed the convictions. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.      Issue:      Whether the use of peremptory challenges to remove a potential juror from the jury pool based on race violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution?      Ruling:      Yes.      Reasoning:      (Powell, J.): In a 7–2 decision, the Court held that, while a defendant is not entitled to have a jury completely or partially composed of people of his own race, the state is not permitted to use its peremptory challenges to automatically exclude potential members of the jury because of their race. \\"The Equal Protection Clause guarantees the defendant that the state will not exclude members of his race from the jury venire on account of race or on the false assumption that members of his race as a group are not qualified to serve as jurors.\\"      \\"The harm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community. Selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.\\"      A defendant in a criminal case can make an Equal Protection claim based on the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges at a defendant's trial. Once the defendant makes a showing that race was the reason potential jurors were excluded, the burden shifts to the state to come forward with a race-neutral explanation for the exclusion.      Concurrrence:      (White, J.) Justice White wrote that although the Court's prior precedent should have warned prosecutors that using peremptory challenges to exclude people based solely on race violates the Equal Protection Clause, the widespread practice of discriminatory elimination of jurors justifies the opportunity to inquire into the basis of the peremptory challenge.      (Marshall, J.) Justice Thurgood Marshall agreed with the decision in the case, but asserted that the Court should eliminate the use of peremptory challenges in all criminal proceedings so that they could not be used as a front for impermissible racial considerations. Justice Marshall asserted that under the current system, prosecutors are still free to discriminate so long as it is not blatant, and trial courts face a difficult burden of assessing a prosecutor's motive.      (Stevens, J) Justice Stevens asserted that the Equal Protection claim was properly before the Court even though it was not initially presented by the petitioner because the party defending the judgment expressly relied on the issue as a basis for affirming the state court decision.      (O'Connor, J) Justice O'Connor wrote to agree that the rule announced does not apply retroactively.      Dissent:      (Burger, C.J.) Chief Justice Warren Burger noted that the Equal Protection Clause issue should not have been decided because the petitioner did not properly raise that type of challenge. The Chief Justice also noted that reargument and further briefing on the issue should have been ordered given the importance and tradition of peremptory challenges in the legal system. Peremptory challenges had a long history in both England and America before the Revolution, and the purpose of peremptory challenges was to allow elimination of a particular juror without reason. The Chief Justice also noted that the Court did not apply the conventional Equal Protection Clause framework to the claims before it because the state's interest in preserving peremptory challenges might be so compelling as to allow the types of challenges that happened in this case. In sum, the Chief Justice asserted that \\"[a]n institution like the peremptory challenge that is part of the fabric of our jury system should not be casually cast aside, especially on a basis not raised or argued by the petitioner.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of a death row inmate in a case concerning race discrimination in jury selection.

As soon as their paychecks arrived, Hunter would immediately follow a carefully curated budget plan he had developed over the years, allocating a portion to his bills, savings, and investments. He also set aside a small amount for recreational activities and other personal expenses. Hunter's approach to his financial matters was well-structured, consistent, and disciplined, which enabled him to live comfortably and save for his future goals and aspirations. Robert, on the other hand, lacked the self-discipline to manage his finances effectively. He would often find himself overspending on unnecessary items or indulging in spur-of-the-moment purchases. His inability to stick to a budget plan resulted in a continuous struggle to pay his bills on time and an ever-growing pile of debt. The difference in financial habits between Hunter and Robert eventually started to impact other areas of their lives as well. While Hunter was able to plan and save for vacations, home improvements, and even his retirement, Robert's lack of financial discipline led to delayed vacations, putting off important home repairs, and constant uncertainty about his future financial security. Their social circles also began to diverge as they grew older. Hunter’s friends shared his views on fiscal responsibility; they discussed investment strategies, shared budgeting tips, and encouraged one another in their financial endeavors. In contrast, Robert's friends had similarly poor money management habits, which only served to reinforce his own reckless spending patterns. The impact of their financial choices extended into their family lives as well. Hunter and his wife were able to provide their children with a stable home environment and ensure they had access to quality education, extracurricular activities, and resources to develop their abilities and interests. In contrast, Robert and his family experienced frequent financial strain, which affected not only their living conditions but also the opportunities available to their children. As the years passed, Hunter's steadfast self-discipline and adherence to his financial plan allowed him to accumulate wealth, ensuring that he enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle well into his retirement. Meanwhile, Robert's lack of self-discipline and financial management skills resulted in an endless cycle of debt and a severely diminished quality of life. The consequences of his poor financial choices eventually forced him to reevaluate his priorities and consider making significant changes to his behavior and habits. In conclusion, the primary reason Hunter was able to stay on top of his finances while Robert could not was due to their distinct approaches to financial management and self-discipline. Hunter's meticulous budgeting and unwavering commitment to adhering to his financial plan laid the foundation for a lifetime of financial stability and success. In contrast, Robert's lack of self-discipline and negligence when it came to managing his finances led to a precarious financial situation that negatively impacted many areas of his life. This story serves as a valuable reminder of the importance of developing good financial habits and practicing self-discipline to ensure long-term financial well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It points out the reason for the speaker's endorsement, suggesting that the aspect in question has left a significant positive impact on their evaluation. 3. \\"Originality\\": Originality denotes uniqueness, creativity, novelty, or something that is not derivative or cliché. It is often regarded as a highly valued quality in various fields and industries, such as arts, literature, entertainment, and business. When something is original, it stands out, captures attention, and provides a new experience or perspective that differs from the ordinary. Thus, originality is often associated with positive connotations.

Summarize this article: Fill the sitz bath with warm water and place it over the toilet. This will allow you to sit and soak just your genital area. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of epsom salts in the water and stir the mixture till the salts dissolve. Sit on the bath for 10 to 20 minutes, twice a day. You should do sitz baths three or four days or till the cyst improves. You can buy a sitz bath at a pharmacy or medical supply store. If you don't have a sitz bath, you could also just run a few inches of water in your bathtub. More research is needed, but ACV can be used to try to reduce the size and swelling of vaginal cysts. Either run a sitz bath and add 1 cup of ACV or you can soak a cotton ball or swab with ACV. Apply the soaked cotton ball or swab directly to the cyst and hold it there for 30 minutes twice a day until you notice swelling reduce. While ACV is a popular home remedy, scientists caution against relying on vinegar as a medicinal treatment. Fill a hot water bottle with hot water and wrap it in a clean towel. Place this against the cyst to provide some pain relief. You might also try applying a heat pack, so long as you keep another cloth between the pack and your skin. Take care not to burn the delicate tissue in the vaginal area. You can also dip a flannel or cotton cloth in hot water, wring the water out, and apply it directly against the cyst. Mix 1 to 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel with 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder. Stir until the mixture forms a paste. Use a cotton ball, tampon, or swab to apply the mixture to the cyst. Leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes once a day. Don't rinse or clean off the paste. Just let it run out naturally.  You may want to wear a sanitary napkin so that the bright turmeric doesn't stain your clothing. Studies have shown that turmeric (curcumin) is an anti-inflammatory. This can reduce the irritation caused by vaginal cysts. Since it may take a few days for the cyst to clear up, you may want to take OTC pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If you feel severe pain that doesn't go away after taking OTC medications, contact your doctor. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage and how often to take the medication. Never rub the cyst, even when cleaning or washing the area. Gentle soaks in the sitz bath or tub are enough to keep the area clean. You should never douche. Douching is unnecessary, can irritate the cyst, and is considered to be harmful to women's health in general. Since you'll want to avoid irritating the cyst, consider using a sanitary napkin instead of a tampon, if you're menstruating.","output":"The article provides various home remedies for managing and treating vaginal cysts. One recommended method is to use a sitz bath filled with warm water and 1-2 tablespoons of dissolved Epsom salts. Sitting in the bath for 10-20 minutes twice daily for 3-4 days can help alleviate the cyst. If a sitz bath is unavailable, a bathtub with a few inches of water can be used instead.  Apple cider vinegar (ACV) may potentially reduce the size and swelling of vaginal cysts, although more research is needed. To use ACV, add 1 cup to a sitz bath or apply directly using a soaked cotton ball, holding it against the cyst for 30 minutes twice a day. However, relying solely on vinegar as a medicinal treatment is not recommended by scientists.  For pain relief, hot water bottles or heat packs wrapped in a clean towel can be applied to the cyst, taking care not to burn the delicate vaginal tissue. Alternatively, a hot flannel or cotton cloth can be applied to the cyst.  A mixture of aloe vera gel and turmeric powder, when applied to the cyst with a cotton ball, tampon, or swab for 20-30 minutes daily, might help as well due to turmeric's anti-inflammatory properties. Wearing a sanitary napkin is advised to prevent turmeric stains on clothing.  Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be taken to manage discomfort, but if severe pain persists, consult a doctor. When caring for the cyst, avoid rubbing the area and do not douche, as it can irritate and pose harm to women's health.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 0 = 13*h - 14*h + 47*h + 874 for h, follow the steps below: Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation: 0 = (13 - 14 + 47) * h + 874 This simplifies to: 0 = 46*h + 874 Step 2: To solve for h, start by moving the additive term on the right-hand side to the left-hand side by subtraction: -874 = 46*h Step 3: Finally, solve for h by dividing by the coefficient of h, which is 46: h = -874 / 46  By performing the division, we find: h = -19 Justification: Each of these steps involves a valid algebraic operation used to solve linear equations.

Question: What property can change depending upon the age of a tree when cutting it for wood? Context: Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The process of cell division is how multicellular organisms grow and repair themselves. It is also how many organisms produce offspring. For many single-celled organisms, asexual reproduction is a similar process. The parent cell simply divides to form two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent, whereas sexual reproduction produces a similar, but genetically unique offspring. In sexual reproduction, meiosis produces haploid gametes that fuse during fertilization to produce a diploid zygote ( Figure below ). In other words, a child inherits half of the genetic material from each parent. Look at the family in Figure below . The children resemble their parents, but they are not identical to them. Instead, each has a unique combination of characteristics inherited from both parents. The children, of course, result from sexual reproduction.

But what were once two different types of classes are looking more and more alike and often falling into the same pool of students. At some schools, online courses originally intended for non-traditional students living far from campus have proved surprisingly popular with on-campus students. A recent study found 42 percent of the students enrolled  in its distance education courses were located on campus at the university that was hosting the online courses. Numbers vary depending on the policies of particular colleges, but other schools also have students mixing and matching online and \\"face-to-face\\" credits. Motives range from lifestyle to adapting a job schedule to getting into high--demand courses. Washington State had about 325 on-campus undergraduates taking one or more distance courses last year.

Information:  - Ensemble Studios was a video game developer initially established in 1995 as an independent company by Tony Goodman, Rick Goodman and John Boog-Scott, but was acquired by Microsoft in 2001 and operated as an internal studio until 2009, when it was officially disbanded. Ensemble developed many real-time strategy games, including the \\"Age of Empires\\" game series, \\"Age of Mythology\\", and \\"Halo Wars\\". In addition to game development, Ensemble Studios also made the Genie Game Engine used in \\"Age of Empires\\", \\"\\", and \\"\\". The studio sold 20 million games and was worth an estimated 500 million.  - JoWooD Entertainment AG (formerly JoWooD Productions Software AG, commonly referred to as JoWooD) was an Austrian video game publisher that was founded in 1995. JoWooD went into administration and all assets were purchased by Nordic Games.  - An expansion pack, expansion set, supplement, or simply expansion is an addition to an existing role-playing game, tabletop game or video game. These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters and/or an extended storyline to complete an already released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, (see \\"\\" for \\"Diablo\\"), it may choose to develop the expansion itself or it may do both (Ensemble Studios developed the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III and the first expansion called itself, but contracted Big Huge Games for the second expansion pack, the Asian Dynasties). Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the \\"Dragon Slayer\\" games \\"\\" and \\"Sorcerian\\".  - Gothic II : Night of the Raven ( German : Die Nacht Des Raben ) , often abbreviated as NotR , is the official expansion pack of the German role - playing video game Gothic II. The expansion focuses on further enlarging the story already presented in the original Gothic II game , by adding a new world called Jharkendar , new attributes , items , and weapons . Upon its first release in 2003 the game was available in the German language only , the English version only being released in 2005 , as part of the Gothic II Gold package .  - Big Huge Games is a video game developer located in Timonium, Maryland. The company was founded in February 2000 by four veteran game industry developers: Tim Train, David Inscore, Jason Coleman and Brian Reynolds (lead designer of \\"Alpha Centauri\\", et al.). Their first game, \\"Rise of Nations\\", was a critical and commercial hit. The original studio became defunct in May 2012, but the name \\"Big Huge Games\\" was later reacquired by Reynolds and Train for their new venture (previously known as SecretNewCo). The revived studio released the mobile game \\"DomiNations\\" on Android and iOS in April 2015.  - In , Falcom released \\"Sorcerian Forever\\" for Microsoft Windows-based PCs. In , Falcom released \\"Sorcerian Original\\", a remake of Sorcerian for Microsoft Windows-based PCs. In addition, console versions of Sorcerian with somewhat differing content from their PC counterparts were developed: A version for the Mega Drive was developed by Sega, a version for the PC Engine CD was developed by Victor Musical Industries, and a version for the Dreamcast was developed by Victor Interactive Software.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - Gothic II is a role-playing video game and the sequel to \\"Gothic\\", by the German developer Piranha Bytes.

Using deodorant regularly was a priority for Tanya, but not for Betty, and as a result nobody felt the need to avoid","output":"Tanya when she was around. You see, deodorant is a special spray or roll-on that grown-ups use to smell nice and keep their underarms fresh and dry. Kind of like when mommy puts powder on your bottom after giving you a bath. Now, Tanya always put some deodorant on in the morning, just like brushing her teeth. But Betty, on the other hand, didn't use deodorant. She forgot about it most of the time, so she didn't smell as nice as Tanya and sometimes her underarms were a bit wet, which wasn't very pleasant for Betty and people around her. See, when people don't smell nice, it can make it hard for others to be near them since nobody likes bad smells. This made people want to be close to Tanya more because she smelled fresh and nice, like flowers or fruits. But they didn't want to be too close to Betty and they kept their distance, just like how you move away when your little brother's diaper is stinky. One day, Betty noticed that people were always around Tanya and she felt sad and lonely. So, she asked Tanya what her secret was. Tanya, being a good friend, told Betty about the magic of deodorant and how it keeps her smelling nice all day long, just like a spring breeze!  Betty decided to give deodorant a try and soon she smelled just as nice as Tanya. People started to enjoy being around her and stopped avoiding her. From that day on, Betty never forgot to put on her deodorant, just like Tanya. And so, Tanya and Betty, both smelling nice and fresh, became the best of friends and enjoyed playing, laughing, and going on adventures together with all their friends who now loved being around them. They learned that something as simple as using deodorant can make a big difference in how other people feel about being close to you.

I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me.

It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost.

Can you tell me the answer to where were the night at the museum movies filmed??","output":"The Night At The Museum movies, a popular series of films directed by Shawn Levy, features a magical world that comes to life within the confines of various museum exhibits. The films were primarily shot on location in a variety of museums and studios across different cities. 1. Night At The Museum (2006): The first installment in the franchise was filmed at several locations. The museum scenes were predominantly filmed in the American Museum of Natural History, located in New York City. The institution, with its vast collection of exhibits and displays, provided the perfect backdrop for Ben Stiller and the film's ensemble cast to interact with a range of historical figures and animals. Additionally, indoor and outdoor scenes were filmed at Vancouver Film Studios, British Columbia, Canada, which was used to recreate some sections of the museum due to filming restrictions. 2. Night At The Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009): The sequel expanded the scope of museum settings and took the film to the National Mall in Washington, D.C. While location-based filming took place at the Smithsonian Institution Building (The Castle), many museums within the Smithsonian complex didn't allow filming within their premises. As a result, soundstages at 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles, California, were used to recreate museum interiors, such as the National Air and Space Museum and the National Gallery of Art. Additionally, parts of the movie were shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 3. Night At The Museum: Secret of the Tomb (2014): In the third installment, the focus shifted to the British Museum in London. Although several exterior shots were taken at the actual museum, major interior scenes were filmed on detailed sets built in Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, Surrey, England, as well as the Mammoth Studios in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. Furthermore, the crew filmed some London-based outdoor scenes in iconic locations like Trafalgar Square, the Tower Bridge, and the West End theater district. In conclusion, the Night At The Museum movies were filmed across various iconic museums and studio locations in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. While the American Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian Institution, and the British Museum served as primary settings, the lack of filming permissions inside these establishments led the production team to recreate the museum interiors in studios like the 20th Century Fox Studios, Vancouver Film Studios, Mammoth Studios, and Shepperton Studios."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The description provides a scene of three people (a couple and a woman) on a tree-lined dirt road. This road is likely outdoor or in a rural setting, as it is surrounded by trees and is not paved. The main focus of the description is on the people and the environment they are in.  2. The description also implies that the three individuals are posing, most likely for a picture or some form of documentation. It highlights the bond and interaction between the couple, as they are holding hands, and another woman who is also part of the scene. This detail signifies the action and purpose of the individuals in the scenario. Now, let's examine the statement \\"People are riding in a train.\\" This statement implies that there are individuals in a specific mode of transportation, in this case, a train. It is important to note that the setting is different from the given description as trains are typically associated with urban or more developed areas, as opposed to the rural or natural setting of a tree-lined dirt road. Moreover, the activity and purpose of the people are different, as they are now riding the train and not posing for a picture. In conclusion, the statement \\"People are riding in a train\\" cannot be derived from the description \\"A couple holding hands and a woman standing beside them pose on a tree-lined dirt road,\\" as there is no information mentioning or indicating the presence of a train or the individuals involved in this activity in the given description. The two scenarios have different settings, primary activities, and purposes, which makes it impossible to deduce the train-riding conclusion from the original description."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

General Count Fedor Keller had assumed command of the Russian Eastern Force from General Zasulich after the Battle of Yalu River. His force of 25,000 men held Motien Pass, in the middle of Liaodong Peninsula, on the main road between Antung (modern Dandong, China) and Liaoyang. Keller, a loyal friend of General Aleksey Kuropatkin and a student of General Mikhail Skobelev, observed that the Japanese strategy was similar to that of the First Sino-Japanese War (i.e. that the three Japanese armies would converge on Haicheng, as they had 10 years previously). Kuropatin agreed, and in an effort to fortify his position at Haicheng, he began a series of complex and confusing troop movements as he endeavored to plug real or imaginary gaps in his defensive line. Keller, already weakened by the loss of men at the Battle of Te-li-Ssu, was further forced to give up two more regiments to Kuropatin's defenses at Haicheng.  - The Imperial Russian Army was the land armed force of the Russian Empire, active from around 1721 to the Russian Revolution of 1917.

It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the East Sea.  - The Russo-Japanese War (8 February 1904  5 September 1905) was fought between the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea. The major theatres of operations were the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria and the seas around Korea, Japan and the Yellow Sea.  - Mikhail Dmitrievich Skobelev ( ) was a Russian general famous for his conquest of Central Asia and heroism during the Russo-Turkish War of 18771878. Dressed in white uniform and mounted on a white horse, and always in the thickest of the fray, he was known and adored by his soldiers as the \\"White General\\" (and by the Turks as the \\"White Pasha\\"). During a campaign in Khiva, his Turkmen opponents called him \\"goz zanli\\" or \\"Bloody Eyes\\".

The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia.

Renewable Energy Resource Sunlight Sunlight can be used to heat homes. It can also be used to produce electricity. This conversion is made possible by solar cells. However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy. Example Solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a familys needs. Moving Water Falling water can have a lot of energy. Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work. Wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy. Only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind. Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and not very nice to look at.

Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: If two scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory are correct, people will still be driving gasoline powered cars 50 years from now, giving out heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere--and yet that carbon dioxide will not contribute to global warming. In a proposal by two scientists, vehicle emissions   would no longer contribute to global warming. The scientists, F. Jeffrey Martin and William L. Kubic Jr., are proposing a concept, which they have named Green Freedom, for removing carbon dioxide from the air and turning it back into gasoline. The idea is simple. Air would be blown over a liquid solution of potassium carbonate, which would absorb the carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide would then be put to chemical reactions that would turn it into fuel : gasoline or jet fuel. This process could change carbon dioxide from an unwanted, climate-changing pollutant into a vast resource for renewable fuels. The cycle--equal amounts of carbon dioxide produced and removed--would mean that cars, trucks and airplanes using the synthetic   fuels would no longer be contributing to global warming. Although they have not yet built a synthetic fuel factory, or even a small model, the scientists say it is all based on existing technology. \\"Everything in the concept has been built, is operating or has a close cousin that is operating.\\" Dr. Martin said. The Los Alamos proposal does not go against any laws of physics, and other scientists who have independently suggested similar ideas. Dr. Martin said he and Dr. Kubic had worked out their concept in more detail than former proposals. There is, however, a major fact that explains why no one has built a carbon-dioxide-to-gasoline factory: it requires a great deal of energy. According to their analysis, their concept, which would cost about 5 billion to build, could produce gasoline at an operating cost of 1.40 a gallon and would turn economically practical when the price at the pump hits 4.60 a gallon.

They address different topics and concerns. I will address each question separately for your understanding. Question 1: Should you stay at a hostel or book something on Airbnb while traveling to London solo to meet cool people? Step 1: Evaluate accommodation options Hostels tend to be more social, with shared spaces like kitchens, lounges, and dormitory-style rooms. Airbnb, on the other hand, offers various types of accommodations like entire homes, private rooms, or shared rooms.  Step 2: Consider your goals and preferences As you mentioned that your main goal is to meet cool people, a hostel could be a more suitable option as it creates more opportunities for social interactions with other travelers through shared living spaces and organized activities. Step 3: Compare costs and amenities Hostels are usually more budget-friendly than Airbnb accommodations. However, Airbnb may offer more privacy and comfortable amenities if that is also important for you. You can compare the costs and additional features like location, cleanliness, and reputation before making a decision. Final recommendation: Considering your goal of meeting cool people, a hostel would likely provide a better environment for fostering social interactions with other travelers. However, if you're looking for more privacy or specific amenities, you may want to explore Airbnb options that still offer opportunities to socialize, such as renting a private room in a shared house.

Step 1: Evaluate eligibility Each university has its specific requirements for admission, which typically include minimum GPA, language proficiency, and relevant experience. It would be necessary to evaluate if your CGPA, projects, internship, and extracurricular activities align well with the admission requirements for TU Delft's MSc Computer Science program. Step 2: Assess competitiveness Admission to TU Delft can be competitive. While your current credentials may make you eligible for the program, you would need to compare your profile with that of other potential candidates to determine your competitiveness. Step 3: Personal statement and references Universities also review personal statements, recommendation letters, and other application materials to evaluate candidates. A well-written personal statement and strong recommendation letters can improve your chances of admission. Final recommendation: While I cannot guarantee your admission to TU Delft's MSc Computer Science program, having a good CGPA, relevant experience, and extracurricular activities are assets.

Title: Buried Movie plot: On October 23, 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian truck driver working in Iraq, wakes up and finds himself buried alive in a wooden coffin, bound and gagged, with only a Zippo lighter and a BlackBerry phone at hand. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

Process:  - An egg is laid by a mother bird - A baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized - The baby bird begins pecking out of the egg - The baby bird is unable to fly to get food - The mother bird must feed the baby bird food - The bird grows stronger and grows wings - The bird is able to fly - The bird is able to leave the nest and find food - The bird is able to reproduce.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more pressure happens, how will it affect LESS birds.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Step 1: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis involves increased pressure for LESS birds. This pressure could be environmental, social, or otherwise unspecified. Step 2: Analyze each stage in the bird's life process with the perturbation hypothesis in mind. 1. An egg is laid by a mother bird: Increased pressure may result in fewer eggs being laid due to changes in the environment (e.g. lack of food or resources), or increased stress on mother birds. 2. A baby bird forms within the egg if it is fertilized: Increased pressure may negatively affect the fertilization process, reducing the number of baby birds formed. 3. The baby bird begins pecking out of the egg: Increased pressure may not directly impact this stage, but indirectly, it could cause the baby birds to be weaker due to problems in earlier stages. 4. The baby bird is unable to fly to get food: Increased pressure may lead to a higher number of baby birds unable to fly due to weakness from environmental stresses. 5. The mother bird must feed the baby bird food: Increased pressure may affect the availability of food, forcing mother birds to spend more time and energy searching for food, potentially offering less care to their babies. 6. The bird grows stronger and grows wings: Increased pressure may result in birds taking longer to develop if resources are scarce or environmental factors (e.g. extreme temperatures) are detrimental. 7. The bird is able to fly: Increased pressure could delay a bird's ability to fly as it will take longer to grow and develop. 8. The bird is able to leave the nest and find food: Increased pressure could make it more challenging for birds to find food, leading to less successful independence and survival rates. 9. The bird is able to reproduce: Increased pressure may negatively affect reproduction rates due to factors like environmental stress, delayed maturity, or difficulty in finding mates. Step 3: Summarize the effect of the perturbation hypothesis on the bird's life process. The perturbation hypothesis of increased pressure does have an effect on the bird's life process, both directly and indirectly. This increased pressure can affect factors like the number of eggs laid, fertilization, development, food availability, and ultimately reproduction rates. As a result, there would likely be fewer birds produced at various stages of the life process due to these challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: The answer to the question: What are the first names of Nan's grandchildren? is inside the article: The movie begins with a scooter chase between Harry and his nan because she didn't know it was him. Afterwards, Harry is sent to get a chicken for lunch, but they fire a machine gun at him and throw a grenade, which Harry throws into the chicken shed, blowing them up. Nan tells Harry the story of his twin brother, Otto, which Harry claims to have heard before.  Suddenly, Harry and Nan then discover that their beloved pet hamster Abu is ill after he vomits a green substance on them, so they take him to the vet. He is almost put down until Harry takes him back home. Ed the vet and his assistant, Kisko, are working for Harry's neo-Nazi twin brother Otto who was abandoned by Nan in the 1970s, claiming it was because she couldn't look after them both, and was raised by Alsatians. After another failed attempt to capture Abu (by disguising as a priest and a nun), Harry and Nan decide to take him on a trip in their Rover P6 to Blackpool for a week before he dies (when Abu really wanted to visit the home of Rihanna).

Choices:  - tunnel - stringed instrument - transportation system - spectacles - radio  The rationale to choose \\"stringed instrument\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"A neck and bridge are key components of a stringed instrument. B: The context revolves around playing an instrument. C: Other options are unrelated to the given context. The statement describes a person admiring two important components - the neck and bridge - before deciding to play something. Both the neck and bridge are crucial parts of a stringed instrument, such as a guitar or a violin, among others. They serve essential roles in the construction and overall playability of these types of instruments. The neck is the elongated part of the instrument, where finger positioning and fretting occur. It is typically made from a solid piece of wood and is designed to bear the tension of the strings. On the other hand, the bridge is responsible for anchoring the strings to the body of the instrument and transmitting the vibrations produced by the strings to the instrument's body, ultimately creating sound. In the given context, it is apparent that the focus is on someone's actions and reactions toward playing an instrument, specifically a stringed one. This person is likely preparing to play a piece of music or perhaps entertaining the idea of learning the instrument. By taking the time to admire and examine its construction, it indicates a level of intrigue and appreciation for the craftsmanship involved in constructing such an instrument. The other potential choices - tunnel, transportation system, spectacles, and radio - are not related to the given context. None of these options possess a neck or bridge, nor require a person to \\"play\\" with them. Furthermore, these choices have no direct association with music or sound production like a stringed instrument does. For example, a tunnel and transportation system are large scale infrastructures, focusing primarily on enabling transport and mobility. Spectacles are eyewear, designed to assist with vision correction or protection from sunlight. Lastly, a radio is a device meant for receiving and playing audio over the airwaves, not an object that one would play in a similar manner to an instrument. Considering these aspects, the logical answer to the question is \\"stringed instrument.\\" The rationale to choose this answer is rooted in the contextual relevance of the phrase \\"neck and bridge,\\" the understanding of the components' functionality in making music, and the distinction between stringed instruments and the unrelated choices presented. This demonstrates a cohesive and accurate rationale for selecting \\"stringed instrument\\" as the appropriate response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: When did Nazi occupied Italy? Movie title: Von Ryan's Express Movie plot: August 1943- Nazi-occupied Italy. An American P-38 Lightning fighter plane with smoke trailing from one of its engines sputters and loses altitude above an Italian coastal town. A pair of German officers abruptly interrupt their lunch to catch up with the rapidly descending plane. When the Germans arrive at the crash site, they encounter a burning fuselage surrounded by Italian soldiers. The soldiers explain that the pilot was killed in the crash. Satisfied, the Germans leave. As soon as they are gone, the Italians mock their imperious occupiers and part ranks to reveal a hidden and slightly injured American flyer, Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra).Ryan is taken to an Italian POW camp filled with British and American prisoners. Italian discipline over the camp is lax and the prisoners are filthy and ragged. Constant escape attempts have enraged the Italian commandant and resulted in the withholding of clean clothes, hot water, razors, and food parcels. The ranking British officer has just died while imprisoned in the camp sweat box. Command has fallen to the irascible British Major Fincham (Trevor Howard) of the Ninth Fusiliers. The pragmatic Ryan and the inflexible Major Fincham immediately clash, with Ryan outranking Fincham and able to coutermand his orders.With the Americans only weeks from liberating the camp, Ryan wants all futile escape attempts stopped. He betrays the active escape tunnels to the Italian commandant, Major Battaglia (Adolfo Celi), earning both the enmity of the British prisoners and the scornful nickname \\"Von Ryan.\\" As a reward for Ryan's cooperation, Battaglia turns the showers back on and issues razors and Red Cross parcels. But he balks at issuing clean clothing, since he is selling the donated clothes on the black market. Ryan orders the men to strip and burn their filthy clothes.

At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story. Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \\"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \\"The first bite took me to heaven,\\" Chen recalls while laughing. \\"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet. His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016. The exhibition at the National Art Museum of China will last until April 22. After the exhibition tour, he will sell his works through an auction , and all the money will be donated to protection of the environment in China. \\"The natural environment of New Zealand has inspired my artwork and brought me enjoyment. I hope people in my home country can enjoy the same beautiful environment as I do,\\" says Chen, who has made New Zealand his home for the last 26 years.

Very few films capture the attention of middle school instrumental students as well as \\"They Shall Have Music\\". My clarinet teacher at USC, Mitchell Lurie, appears as the young clarinetist in the school orchestra. Beverly Sills is the talented singing voice behind the youthful actress appearing with the Peter Merenblum Youth Orchestra. And Heifetz appears five times! What great gems to show to young music students, especially my inner city kids! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review depicts the product, which in this case is the film \\"They Shall Have Music\\", in a highly flattering light. Multiple elements contribute to this positive representation. Firstly, the reviewer's use of it in their music classroom illustrates that they find it to be a valuable educational tool. This is significant as the reviewer is likely to be an expert given their profession as a music teacher, hence underscoring the educational value of the film. Further evidence of a flattering depiction is the reviewer's assertion that \\"very few films capture the attention of middle school instrumental students as well as 'They Shall Have Music'\\". This statement both communicates the film's potential as an engaging resource for teaching music to young students and sets it apart from other films in its ability to hold students' attention, an essential factor in effective teaching and learning. In addition, the reviewer is also praising the film by recalling the involvement of their clarinet teacher, Mitchell Lurie, and the contributions of Beverly Sills and the Peter Merenblum Youth Orchestra in the film. Highlighting these participants not only reflects the high quality of the music and performances presented in the movie, but it also provides potentially interesting and meaningful connections for the students watching.  The reviewer emphasizes Heifetz's appearance five times in the film. This serves to outline the rich musical content in the film and suggests that the movie includes significant moments, performances or pieces of music that would be interesting or valuable for students to witness.  Finally, the statement \\"What great gems to show to young music students, especially my inner city kids!\\" indicates that the reviewer believes the film presents unique, high-quality musical content that can enrich students' musical experience and education, which again reinforces the highly flattering representation of the film. Therefore, from the educational viewpoint of the reviewer, all their observations, experiences, and praises for \\"They Shall Have Music,\\" unmistakably depict the movie in a very positive and flattering light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When more time occurs, it allows for the plant roots to grow further into the rock, resulting in more significant cracks and breaks, as well as dissolution by plant acids. This may initially suggest increased weathering. However, the question asks about a perturbation that would cause less or slower weathering to occur.  In this case, the supposed perturbation would most likely be something that indirectly impacts a step of the process. Some possible examples of indirect impacts could be changes in environmental or climatic factors affecting the growth rate or longevity of a plant (e.g., a drought or reduced sunlight). When these external factors negatively influence plant growth and the overall health of the plant, it would likely result in reduced root penetration into the rock and, subsequently, a slower weathering process.

One night, as Kevin is sleeping, an armoured knight on a horse bursts out of his wardrobe. Kevin is scared and hides as the knight rides off into a forest setting where once his bedroom wall was; when Kevin looks back out, the room is back to normal and he finds one of his photos on the wall similar to the forest he saw.

It marked Hartl's directoral debut. The film is in the tradition of the nostalgic Old Heidelberg.","output":"Okay little one, let me help you understand this. The text talks about a movie called \\"A Student's Song of Heidelberg\\". It's a musical film from Germany made in 1930. The movie is related to something called Old Heidelberg, which could be known by many people. However, the text does not specifically say if the songs in this movie are well known. So, we can't say for sure if the sentence is true or not just based on this information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. There's not much to say about this one. Gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle. He is loosed by a nuclear explosion. He heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk (oh yeah, power lines. I almost forgot). At one time, early in the film, he befriends a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away, or squashing him, he places him down on the ground. Safe. From then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away, show up and run away, show up and run away. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away. Oh, well, the plot is to try to get Gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space. As usual, the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated (a guy in a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of Americans), uses up enough ammunition and fire power to solve the national debt, and, of course, it does no good. They should know this anyway. We've seen a lot of monsters stomp on Tokyo. Not to put these down because they can be fun, but it's really not very good. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The person writing the review did not seem to enjoy the movie and found some aspects of it to be not very good. They mentioned that the plot was not very strong, and they did not like how the monster, Gammera, was portrayed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. I've been willing to put up with a lot from late-spring/summer action fluff movies, but in general that's been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff (i.e. cool special effects, interesting plot twists, comic value, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This movie, however, had none of this. All that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of Eva Longoria's cleavage (an issue of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, suspense, back story, character development, continuity, etc. I would get into specifics, but quite frankly I've already-maybe willingly-forgotten most of the movie. The entire time I was in the theater, I was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on DVD. Save your money on this one, folks. Unless you really, really, really like Eva Longoria's cleavage. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

Q: Q: What are the effects of light on plant morphology called?   A: A:","output":"The phenomenon of plants changing their growth patterns, movements, and orientation in response to different light sources or wavelengths is referred to as Photomorphogenesis. This term underscores the crucial role of light in shaping plant morphology, which is a key factor in their growth, development, and overall survival. In photomorphogenesis, various types of light affect plants differently, leading to diverse growth patterns. The principle photoreceptors involved in this intricate light signaling system are blue light receptors known as Cryptochromes and Phototropins, and red/far-red light receptors called Phytochromes. These light receptors enable plants to efficiently adapt and respond to the intensity, direction, and wavelength of the light available. Some of the specific effects of light on plant morphogenesis include: 1. Seed Germination and Seedling Photomorphogenesis: Light plays a vital role in breaking seed dormancy and regulating seedling photomorphogenesis. In many plant species, the germination process is stimulated by exposure to red light and inhibited by far-red light, with phytochromes being the primary photoreceptors responsible for this response. 2. Phototropism: Plants display directional growth towards a light source, a phenomenon called phototropism. This is particularly evident in the curvature of stems and leaves as they grow toward the light for optimal photosynthesis. Phototropins, the blue light receptors, are the main mediators of this response. 3. Shade Avoidance Syndrome: As the available light reduces, plants exhibit shade avoidance syndrome, in which they elongate their stems, leaves, and petioles to outgrow surrounding plants and reach sunlight. The perception of the ratio of red to far-red light is a key factor in triggering this response. 4. Photoperiodism: Photoperiodism is the regulation of developmental processes in plants by the relative lengths of daylight and nighttime. This phenomenon influences a variety of plant responses, including flowering, dormancy, and leaf abscission. Both phytochromes and cryptochromes play significant roles in these processes. 5. Chloroplast Movement and Orientation: Depending on the light quality and intensity, chloroplasts can move within plant cells to optimize photosynthesis. Blue light receptors, specifically phototropins, are responsible for mediating these movements. 6. Circadian Rhythms: Light serves as a fundamental external cue for synchronizing the circadian clock in plants. This internal biological clock regulates various processes, such as leaf movement, growth, and the timing of flowering. Photoreceptors, like phytochromes and cryptochromes, are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. In conclusion, the effects of light on plant morphology, known as photomorphogenesis, encompass an array of physiological and developmental processes governed by the intricate coordination of various photoreceptors. These light-induced processes not only dictate a plant's growth, survival, and reproduction, but also contribute to its adaptation in a constantly changing environment."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],D={key:0},N={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",j,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
