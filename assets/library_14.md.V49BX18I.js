But it seems that my parents don't understand me now. They expect me to be the same person I was before I went abroad, but I'm not! Why can't they let me be myself? Jimmy Hi, Jimmy, As far as I know, people who have lived abroad often find that the adjustment   to returning home is more difficult than their adjustment to living in a foreign culture. Why? We expect to have some problems when we go to a new place, speak a different language and learn the rules of a different culture ... But home? ... we know that place! Your parents expect that the same person who boarded the airplane one year ago will be returning. Especially if they have never been abroad themselves, your parents probably won't understand the changes that living abroad can cause in a person. On the other hand, you may have maintained   an ideal mental image of your loved ones while abroad, an image that is broken into pieces when you return. Remember you have been living a different lifestyle in your host country, and you have probably become very independent while staying there alone. Now that you're home, you will be expected to conform   again to the lifestyle of your family. As a result, you may be upset about your parents' involvement in your life. Communication is the key to overcoming this problem. Tell your parents how you are feeling. Share with them information about cultural re-entry , and ask them to be patient. This does not mean that you have to forget your experience and give up everything you've learned!

Kevin would salt their meat before cooking while Craig used nothing, so","output":"once upon a time, there were two friends named Kevin and Craig. They both loved to cook, but they had their own ways of doing it. Everyday, when Kevin cooked meat, he would sprinkle some tiny white specks on it. Those tiny specks were called salt. Salt is important because it makes the meat tastier. Just like when we add sugar to our cereal to make it sweet, we add salt to our meat to make it taste better. Craig, on the other hand, didn't like using anything on his meat – he enjoyed it just the way it was. Craig believed that the meat had its own special flavor that was good enough. It's like eating strawberries without adding sugar. They're still tasty! One sunny day, their friends decided to have a barbecue. Kevin and Craig offered to cook the meat, since they loved cooking so much. They each had their own section of the grill. Kevin was busy salting the meat like always, while Craig was simply cooking the meat without adding anything to it. As their friends tasted the meat from both Kevin and Craig's sections, they noticed a difference in the flavors. Some of their friends preferred the saltiness that Kevin added to his meat; they thought the extra flavor made it yummy. Other friends liked Craig's meat better because it had a simple, natural taste, not too strong, just right for them. After everyone had eaten, they shared their opinions with Kevin and Craig. The friends told them that both ways of cooking were good, and it just depended on each person's preference. Kevin and Craig learned that there is no right or wrong way to cook, as long as it tastes good to those enjoying it. From then on, they continued cooking in their own special ways, knowing that sometimes, it's nice to have different flavors to choose from.

A more focused and explanatory version of the statement can be written as an answer to the question. A more detailed and long answer could be as follows: During the Korean War, particularly at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir on November 27, 1950, the US and ROK troops faced a series of unexpected challenges when confronted with the tactics employed by the People's Volunteer Army (PVA). The PVA 9th Army Group launched a three-pronged encirclement maneuver against the US 7th Infantry Division Regimental Combat Team and the US 1st Marine Division, both of which were unprepared for the scale and tactics used by their adversaries. One of the tactics that the US and ROK troops were not prepared for was the PVA's 'human wave' assault. These assaults utilized large groups of PVA soldiers who charged enemy positions in waves, overwhelming their opponents with sheer numbers and relentless pressure. The 'human wave' technique was unfamiliar to both US and ROK troops, who were accustomed to more deliberate, conventional military approaches. This strategy showcased the PVA's numerical superiority on the battlefield, which was ultimately a significant challenge for the US and ROK forces. Moreover, the PVA also executed infiltration tactics, where they bypassed the main combat lines, moved through challenging terrain such as mountainous areas, and attacked the US and ROK forces from their flanks and the rear, further complicating their defenses. This caused confusion and disorganization amongst the US and ROK troops, as they struggled to identify and respond to enemy combatants who had breached their defensive lines.  Additionally, the PVA demonstrated a proficiency in nighttime warfare, launching surprise attacks during the hours of darkness and thus exploiting the US and ROK forces' lack of preparedness in this regard. The PVA had extensive experience in night-time combat from their previous encounters in the Chinese Civil War, and this experience played a significant role in their ability to disrupt and disorient the US and ROK troops during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Despite the PVA's superior tactics, the US and ROK forces managed to escape the encirclement through a combination of firepower, determination, and Air Force and X Corps support fire. Even though they suffered around 15,000 casualties in total, this retreat, often referred to as the \\"Chosin Reservoir campaign\\" or the \\"Frozen Chosin,\\" was viewed as a significant achievement, given the unfavorable circumstances and the challenges posed by the PVA's distinct tactics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They were merely putting to use one of the newest methods of locating minerals in the ground -- using trees and plants as signs that certain minerals may lie under the ground on which the trees and plants are growing. This newest method of searching for minerals is based on the fact that minerals deep in the earth may affect the kind of bushes and trees that grow on the surface. At Watson Bar Creek, a mineral search group gathered bags of tree seeds. Boxes were filled with small branches from the trees. Roots were dug and put into boxes. Each bag and box was carefully marked. In a scientific laboratory the parts of the forest trees were burned to ashes andtested. Each small part was examined to learn whether there were minerals in it. Study of the roots, branches and seeds showed no silver. But there were small amount of gold in the roots and a little less gold in the branches and seeds. The seeds growing nearest to the tree trunk had more gold than those growing on the ends of the branches.

It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies).

Price Range: The first piece of data is about the price range at Strada, which states that it is more than £30. This suggests that the restaurant falls under the higher-end category in terms of pricing. Customers can anticipate spending more than £30 per person for a meal when dining at Strada. Consequently, it could be inferred that the menu items are priced at a premium, and the restaurant may be targeting diners who are willing to spend a considerable amount for a high-quality dining experience. This price range could also indicate that the restaurant offers a more sophisticated menu or uses high-end ingredients in its dishes. 2. Customer Rating: The second part of the data indicates that Strada has a low customer rating. A low rating typically implies that the restaurant has received negative reviews or feedback from its customers. This can be due to various factors, such as the taste and quality of the food, the overall service provided by the staff, the restaurant's ambiance, or any other aspect that may have affected the dining experience. As a result, potential customers may be hesitant to visit Strada, as they may perceive the low customer rating as a reflection of the restaurant's inability to consistently deliver satisfying dining experiences. However, customer ratings should always be taken with a grain of salt, as they can sometimes be overly influenced by one-time experiences or personal preferences that differ from the majority. 3. Family-friendly: The final piece of data highlights that Strada is not considered family-friendly. A restaurant being family-friendly usually means that they cater to the needs of families with children, providing special menus, highchairs, play areas, and a relaxed environment that accommodates the varying needs of family members of different ages. The fact that Strada is not labelled as family-friendly indicates that it may not have the appropriate facilities or services to cater to families with young children. Additionally, the restaurant's atmosphere or menu might be less appealing to families in general, as they might find it too formal, upscale, or not suited for younger palates. Nevertheless, this information suggests that Strada may be more suitable for an adult audience, individuals seeking a higher-end dining experience, or couples looking for a more romantic or intimate atmosphere. In conclusion, based on the provided data, Strada is a restaurant with a price range of over £30, a low customer rating, and is not considered family-friendly. This information allows potential diners to make informed decisions based on their preferences, budget, and dining requirements. However, it is essential to remember that individual experiences may differ, and it is always recommended to try the restaurant personally before making a final judgment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: As the price of a college degree continues to rise, there's growing evidence that the monetary  payoff isn't quite as big as often advertised. The best estimate now is that a college degree is worth about 300,000 in today's dollars--nowhere near the million figure that is often quoted. \\"That million number has driven me crazy!\\" says Sandy Baum, a Skidmore economist who studied the value of a college degree for the College Board last year. Baum's research showed that college graduates earn, on average, about 20,000 a year more than those who finished their educations at high school. Add that up over a 40-year working life and the total differential is about 800,000, she figures. But since much of that bonus is earned many years from now, taking away the impact of inflation means that800,000 in future dollars is worth only about 450,000 in today's dollars. Then, if you remove the cost of a college degree--about ,30,000 in tuition and books for students who get no aid and attend public in-state universities--and the money a student could have earned at a job instead of attending school, the real net value in today's dollars is somewhere in the 300,000 range, a number confirmed by other studies. But, especially these days, that still makes a college degree one of the most _ investments a person can make, Baum notes. Better yet, college graduates can go on to earn advanced degrees, which return even bigger payoffs. The average holder of a bachelor's degree earns about51,000 a year, Baum calculates. But those who've gone on to earn MBAs, law degrees, or other professional degrees earn about 100,000 a year. In addition, Baum found that there are plenty of other rewards for a degree. The quality of the jobs college graduates get is far better, for example. College graduates are more likely to get jobs with health insurance. And it is easier for them to find and hold jobs. The unemployment rate for college graduates was just 2.2 percent last year, half the unemployment level of those with only high school...

According to Baum's research, high school graduates earn more than those who have college degrees.; (B). College education is enough to ensure you a good life.; (C).

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

We have 10 'p's and 43 'p's, so... 10*p + 43*p = 53*p Now our problem looks like this: 53*p - 33 - 20 = 0 Next, let's take care of the numbers. We have -33 and -20, and when we put them together, we get: -33 - 20 = -53 That leaves the problem looking like: 53*p - 53 = 0 Now, to find out what 'p' is, we need to make the left side of the equation equal to the right side, which is 0. So, let's add 53 to both sides: 53*p - 53 + 53 = 0 + 53 53*p = 53 Now, to solve for 'p', we'll divide both sides of the equation by 53: 53*p / 53 = 53 / 53 p = 1 So, our answer is p = 1.

This article: On a train trip, lawyer Richard Grant tells fellow passengers that, based on his long experience both prosecuting and defending murder cases, murder is sometimes justified and a clever man should be able to commit it undetected. He is traveling to the isolated estate of his wealthy client and friend, Gordon Rich; his young adult daughter Barbara surprises him at the train station, where she informs him that she has already been there a week. Grant's view is soon put to the test. Rich asks him to rewrite his will, including bequests to all his former mistresses (except one who is dead already; she was just 16, and Grant believes it was suicide). When Rich explains that he wants a new will because he intends to marry Barbara, Grant is appalled. He repeats what he said on the train. Rich deserves to be murdered, and if that is what it takes to stop the marriage, Grant will do it and get away with it. Rich retorts that if necessary he will retaliate from beyond the grave. Grant pleads with his daughter, pointing out the great age difference and Rich's indecent character. But she loves Rich and is adamant. Nor has Tommy Osgood, a young man Barbara had been seeing, been able to change her mind. At a dinner party that night, Rich announces the wedding and says it will take place in the morning.

While in the field, she collected two flowers to examine in detail. She puts the first flower, flower X, under a microscope and begins to look at it. After examination she determines it's an anemophilous plant. She then takes flower Y and repeats the same process to determine that it's an entomophilous type of plant.  and a hint : Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.  Please answer this question : Which flower has a less exposed stamen? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, flower Y, which is an entomophilous plant, has a less exposed stamen compared to flower X, which is an anemophilous plant. Anemophilous plants, like flower X, have well-exposed stamens allowing their pollen to be easily transported by wind currents. Their stamens are more openly displayed and possess a larger, feathery stigma to efficiently capture airborne pollen. In contrast, entomophilous plants, like flower Y, rely on insects for their pollination. These plants generally have less exposed stamens and their pollen is often contained within attractive and fragrant flowers, which serve as a signal to insects. Entomophilous plants have evolved to depend on insects for pollination, investing in larger and more nutritious pollen, as well as nectar, to attract insect pollinators. Their stamens are generally less exposed due to the need to protect the pollen from being dispersed by wind (which is less effective for their reproductive strategy) and to ensure that the insects come into contact with the stamens while visiting the flowers for pollen or nectar. This ensures that pollen is effectively transferred from one flower to another, enabling successful fertilization and reproduction for entomophilous plants. In conclusion, flower Y, the entomophilous plant, has a less exposed stamen when compared to flower X, which is an anemophilous plant. This difference in their reproductive structures is due to the distinct pollination strategies employed by each plant type: anemophilous plants rely on wind for pollen transport, while entomophilous plants depend on insects for effective pollination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: Snot the Norseman gave his name to which English City?","output":"Snot the Norseman, a prominent Anglo-Saxon figure, gave his name to the English city of Nottingham. The history behind the naming of the city can be traced back to the Anglo-Saxon period, around the 6th century AD. It is important to understand the context of the period, the role of Snot the Norseman, and how Nottingham got its name. During the Anglo-Saxon period, England was divided into several small kingdoms, each ruled by a different monarch. One of these kingdoms was Mercia, which was a vast territory stretching from the River Thames in the south to the River Humber in the north. The Kingdom of Mercia encompassed the areas that are now known as the Midlands. The city we now call Nottingham was once a part of this kingdom. Snot the Norseman was a chieftain, or nobleman, of Scandinavian origin who ruled a settlement in this region during the late 9th century. He was a highly respected leader of the Vikings, who had settled in various parts of Mercia. Snot's people lived and thrived under his leadership, and the settlement gradually expanded into a significant center of trade and culture. The original name of the settlement that would later become Nottingham was \\"Snotingaham,\\" which in Old English means \\"the homestead of Snot's people\\" or \\"the village belonging to Snot.\\" It is named after Snot the Norseman due to his influential role in the development of the town. Over time, the name gradually evolved into its present-day form. \\"Snotingaham\\" was shortened and anglicized, first becoming \\"Snottingham,\\" and then eventually \\"Nottingham.\\" Today, Nottingham is a vibrant city with a rich cultural and historical heritage. It is a popular destination for tourists who are interested in exploring its connections to its storied past, including its origins and the influence of Snot the Norseman. In addition to the historical aspects, Nottingham also offers modern attractions such as the National Ice Centre, Nottingham Castle, and Sherwood Forest, which is famously associated with the legendary Robin Hood. In summary, the English city of Nottingham derived its name from Snot the Norseman, a Viking chieftain who ruled over the settlement during the Anglo-Saxon period. As the settlement grew, its name evolved from \\"Snotingaham\\" to its modern form, reflecting the significant impact that Snot the Norseman had on the local community. The city's history can be seen as a testament to the enduring influence of early Norse settlers in England, many centuries later."},{"instruction":"I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it.

Tragic: Mohammed Abdul Razzak, 16, was found on the M60 motorway with multiple injuries days after missing a mock GCSE exam. A gifted schoolboy overcome by stress over his forthcoming GCSE exams jumped to his death from a motorway bridge. Mohammed Abdul Razzak, 16, had told his GP of his desire to end his life at least six times, an inquest heard. Finally, he walked to a motorway bridge near his home, climbed over the barrier and plunged 30ft on to the road below. He was taken to hospital but died from his injuries. The inquest heard that Mohammed was a well-liked and studious boy who was expected to do very well in his exams. But after starting his GCSE year he became withdrawn and anxious, sometimes disappearing from his home at night. His mother, Lufta Begum, said her son became distant and spent a lot of time alone on his computer drinking energy drinks and coffee. In a statement she told the inquest: ‘He was a healthy child, a hard-working, studious young man with a clever demeanour. ‘He was a young man who kept himself to himself and had very good predictions in terms of his academic achievements. But he did not discuss anything with the family or those close to him.’ Last autumn, the pupil went missing from his home in Oldham but turned up at his aunt’s house at 11pm. On another occasion he was reported missing after leaving at 1am and not answering his phone. He returned two hours later. Eventually he skipped a mock exam, later handing a letter to his English teacher explaining that he felt an urge to self-harm. At this point child protection services and his school intervened, and Mohammed spent a weekend in hospital where he was assessed by psychiatrists. Dr Debra Bradley, who oversaw his admission, told the inquest he had missed the exam because he was tired and wanted to end his life out of frustration. Tributes: Oldham Academy North paid tribute to Mohammed, a 'talented' and 'hard-working young man' After the assessment he was discharged and assigned a social worker. A few weeks later he appeared happy after being allowed to visit family in Bangladesh during term time. But just days before his death on January 6, Mohammed spoke to his GP and confided he had planned to commit suicide six times in the past – adding he was only talking about it to test people’s reactions. On January 5, he slept late and was seen by his mother only when he left his room for a shower at 11pm. Over the next few hours Mohammed sent a text message to a friend stating his intention to kill himself, before going out into the night and leaping to his death. His mother was informed at around 4am. Tests on the bridge over the M60 near Oldham showed scuff marks on the barrier, indicating he had climbed over the railing. Recording a verdict of suicide, Rochdale assistant coroner Lisa Hashmi said: ‘Mohammed was a healthy, intelligent young man who clearly had a very promising future. Save his obvious intellect, he was a quiet and reserved individual, however in the autumn of 2013 his mother noticed a change in his demeanour. Mohammed’s family, school and other professionals subsequently became involved in supporting him.’ Colette Burgess, headteacher at his school, Oldham Academy North, said: ‘He was an intelligent, hard-working and talented student with a particular gift for computing. He was a popular and mature young man, highly regarded by his teachers and well respected by his peers.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"1. 16-year-old Mohammed Abdul Razzak, a gifted schoolboy, jumped to his death from a motorway bridge due to stress over impending GCSE exams. 2.

He started acting in 1952 and was the first sportsman to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha (upper house) of India. He worked as Hindi and Punjabi film producer, director and writer, and he acted in films and television.  - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Plants uptake essential elements from the soil through their roots and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their leaves. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of photosynthesis. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, wherein root hairs pump hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, stomata open to take in carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\\"? Answer:","output":"Based on the passage, a comprehensive question that could test a student's understanding might be: \\"Explain the process through which plants absorb essential elements and nutrients. In your response, define the roles of the roots and leaves, and describe the processes of photosynthesis, cation exchange, and the function of stomata. Be sure to discuss how each of these elements and processes contributes to the overall growth and sustenance of the plant.\\" --- This question effectively tests a student's comprehension of several key points from the passage. It gauges their understanding of how plants absorb elements from the soil and air, as well as their understanding of the role of different parts of the plant (roots and leaves).  Moreover, it challenges students to demonstrate their understanding of several complex processes, including photosynthesis, cation exchange, and the function of stomata.  It also requires students to connect these processes and structures, showing how they work together to allow the plants to absorb essential nutrients from the environment, and how these nutrients contribute to the overall growth and health of the plant.

The village symbol is the Briarcliff Rose, a more brightly colored offshoot of the American Beauty rose. Since 2006, the Briarcliff Rose has been used on village street signs. The Briarcliff Manor Garden Club, which also uses the Briarcliff rose as their symbol, was established in 1956. One of its primary functions is in planting, maintaining, and improving public gardens and grounds.Briarcliff Manor has groups in several Scouting organizations, including Cub Scout Pack 6 and Boy Scout Troop 18. Pack 6 became the first Cub Scout pack in the village at its establishment in 1968; by 2002 it had over 70 cubs in 12 dens. The village's first Boy Scout troop was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919. Sources cite Bill Buffman as the first Scoutmaster and John Hersey as the troop's first Eagle Scout. The first Girl Scout troop in the village was founded in 1917 by Louise Miller and Mrs. Alfred Jones, and the first Brownie troop was founded in 1929.The Briarcliff Manor Community Bonfire is a winter holiday event at Law Park, hosted by the village and the Briarcliff Friends of the Arts, involving live music (primarily seasonal and holiday songs), refreshments, and craft projects for children.

Edith Casas, 22, wed Victor Cingolani yesterday in a ceremony taking place less than a year into the groom's 13-year sentence for the murder of model Johana Casas. The bride was pelted with stones and eggs as she emerged from the register office, while her husband, disguised in sunglasses and a beret, was rushed out of the back door to his cell. Killer: Victor Cingolani (right) has married Edith Casas, twin sister of Johana (right) who he murdered The couple married in Pico Truncade in southern Argentina, the same city where Johana was shot twice in the head days before her 20th birthday in July 2010. She said: 'There are no words to describe what","output":"I felt when I married Victor. I understand the anger and pain that this has caused my family and the entire community, but I believe in his innocence and love him deeply. I never thought my life would take such a dramatic turn, but my heart guided me to stand by the man who I believe has been wrongly accused.' The couple's controversial wedding sparked a public outcry, with protests, petitions, and many condemning Edith's decision to marry her twin sister's killer. Edith has had to confront the wrath of her family members, who have disowned her for her actions. She says she is haunted by her sister's death, but remains convinced that her husband is innocent, despite the evidence against him. Following the ceremony, the ugly scenes continued as demonstrators screamed insults and threats at the newly married couple. The furious crowd accused Edith of betraying her sister's memory, while some even suggested that she was complicit in the murder. The situation escalated to the point where the police had to intervene to prevent further violence. In the wake of their tumultuous wedding day, Edith and Victor have attempted to maintain a semblance of normalcy in their exceptionally abnormal life. They spend their days corresponding through letters and making the most of their limited time together during Victor's brief prison visits. Victor has continued to profess his innocence, despite being found guilty of Johana's murder in court. His claims have also been supported by the existence of another suspect in the case, Marcos Diaz, who was Johana's ex-boyfriend. Diaz was sentenced to 16 years in prison shortly after Cingolani for his role in the murder. As the years pass, Edith remains steadfast in her belief that her husband is innocent, and she has made it her life's mission to prove it. She has delved deep into the evidence and sought the help of lawyers, private investigators, and even criminologists in her quest for the truth. The tragic and bizarre love story has become a national obsession in Argentina and continues to divide opinion. While some view Edith as a heartbroken woman blinded by love and grief, others see her as a sinister character who has betrayed her sister's memory. The truth may never be fully uncovered, but one thing is for sure – Edith Casas and Victor Cingolani's journey together is the definition of a love story filled with pain, controversy, and unyielding devotion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Jerry and George are two roommates who have lived together since college. They have always gotten along well, have similar hobbies and even are the same height. They both enjoy watching sports and playing videogames, but Jerry also rides his bike several miles each week. George can't stand exercising. Instead, he prefers to lay around relaxing and driving his car if he needs to go somewhere.  But I can use this background: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  What is an answer for this question: Who has a higher risk of hypertension? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided and the characteristics of Jerry and George, it seems that George has a higher risk of hypertension. Jerry is relatively active, as he enjoys not only watching sports and playing video games but also regularly rides his bike for several miles each week. This physical activity helps him burn calories and potentially prevents excess unused energy from being stored as body fat. Regular exercise has been shown to contribute to better overall health, including improved cardiovascular health and decreased risk of hypertension. On the other hand, George is less physically active, with a preference for relaxing and driving rather than engaging in exercise. This sedentary lifestyle could likely lead to an accumulation of unused energy from food, which in turn would be stored as body fat. If this continues over time, George may become obese, defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m² or greater. As mentioned in the background information, obesity is associated with a higher risk of health problems, including type 2 diabetes and hypertension. While there may be other factors contributing to an individual's risk of hypertension (such as genetics, stress, and smoking), the information provided suggests that George's lifestyle, which involves lower physical activity and potentially results in higher body fat, puts him at a greater risk of hypertension compared to Jerry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current; \`\`all metal'' induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.","output":"Yes, it is true that you can use a cast iron skillet on an induction cooktop based on the text provided. The text explains that in order to use a cookware on an induction cooktop, the cookware must be made of or contain a ferrous metal, such as cast iron or specific types of stainless steel. Cast iron is a ferrous metal, meaning it is rich in iron and has magnetic properties, making it suitable for induction cooking.  Induction cooktops work by generating a magnetic field, which induces a current that produces heat within the cooking vessel. Ferrous metals, like cast iron, are magnetic and can effectively concentrate the current created by the induction cooktop to produce heat. The heat produced in the cast iron skillet can then be effectively used for cooking. On the other hand, cookware made from copper or aluminum is not suitable for induction cooking because the cookware does not have enough magnetic properties. As a result, the magnetic field generated by the induction cooktop cannot effectively produce a concentrated current and induce heating in these types of materials.  However, the text does mention the existence of \\"all metal\\" induction cooktops, which use much higher frequencies to overcome the issue with non-ferrous cookware materials like copper or aluminum. Still, for nearly all standard induction cooktop models, cast iron skillets should work well because of their ferrous metal composition. It is also worth mentioning that if you wish to use non-ferrous cookware on an induction cooktop, you can use a suitable metal disk that would act as a conventional hotplate. By placing the metal disk on the induction cooktop and the cookware on top of the disk, you can essentially cook using any kind of vessel, as the disk acts as a medium to generate heat on the cookware.  In conclusion, a cast iron skillet is ideal for use on induction cooktops due to its ferrous metal composition and magnetic properties. It enables effective heat generation and precise temperature control while cooking, ensuring energy efficiency and streamlined performance."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Q: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. According to the above context, answer the following question. After the article, what will sportspeople probably consume? A:","output":"After the article, sportspeople will probably consume a sufficient amount of protein through their regular diet, focusing on a greater volume of food with higher protein content. This would allow them to meet their protein requirements of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight, depending on their level of athleticism and sport type.

Murphy missed two games this season to attend the birth of his son, which Esiason took issue with. Esiason stated that Murphy's wife should have scheduled a C-section in order to avoid conflict with the baseball games.  The initial comments, which were seen as insensitive by many, were made on Esiason's radio show. He later issued an on-air apology, acknowledging that his words were inappropriate and offensive. Daniel Murphy's decision to prioritize his son's birth over the baseball games was supported by the MLB's policy of allowing players to miss up to three games for paternity leave. Esiason's argument, however, led to a larger discussion about the expectations society places on professional athletes, as well as their obligations to their families and personal lives. The controversy sparked by Esiason's comments highlights the immense pressure on professional athletes to prioritize their careers above all else, even when it comes to significant family events. It brings forth a larger debate as to whether sports figures should be held to the same standards as the average worker, who is often allowed time off for paternity leave and other family-related matters. Esiason, who has a history of making controversial statements, faced backlash from various sources following his remarks about Murphy's situation. Critics claimed that his words were not only insensitive but also underscored an outdated mindset that fails to take into account the importance of work-life balance for all individuals, regardless of their career. In his apology, Esiason admitted that his comments were \\"insensitive\\" and expressed regret for any offense he may have caused. The apology was seen as a step in the right direction by many, but the issue remains a relevant topic of discussion around the evolving expectations and priorities of professional athletes in today's society. As the conversation surrounding this controversy continues, it is essential to consider the unique challenges that athletes face in balancing their personal and professional lives. By recognizing and accommodating the need for work-life balance, both fans and sports organizations can better support these individuals and ultimately contribute to a more compassionate and inclusive sports culture. While Boomer Esiason's comments undoubtedly caused controversy and generated a heated debate, it is crucial to use this incident as an opportunity to further examine and question the expectations placed on professional athletes. By doing so, we can create a world that better accommodates the work-life balance needs of athletes and all individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Apollodrorus The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"The Shadow of Apollodorus\\" Genre: Historical Mystery/Thriller Plot Summary: The story unfolds in the battle-weary city of Alexandria in 30 BC, right after Octavian, the mighty Roman leader, ultimately triumphs over the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. The city and its residents struggle to come to terms with the aftermath of the devastating power struggle and the fall of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Upon claiming victory, Octavian wastes no time in seizing power and begins his occupation of the palace. As he cautiously navigates through the labyrinthine halls and chambers of the grand complex, he stumbles upon a secret room with an enigmatic message engraved on a wall: \\"When shadows cast the truth, search for the light.\\" Intrigued, Octavian, accompanied by his most trusted general, Decimus, starts to explore the deeper secrets of the palace, only to end up discovering the lifeless body of Apollodorus, a confidant and advisor to Cleopatra. Being the last individual he expected to uncover, Octavian soon suspects that Apollodorus had faked his death, perhaps to serve a hidden agenda.  As Octavian delves deeper into investigating Apollodorus and his ties to the Ptolemaic Dynasty, he learns of a secret society called the \\"Order of Thoth,\\" a distinguished group of scholars and statesmen alleged to be guarding an ancient, powerful knowledge that holds the key to immense power and domination. However, the search for unraveling the mystery is not without perils. Octavian finds himself and his comrades in the crosshairs of a group of loyalist assassins, determined to stop them at any cost. As a web of deception, conspiracy, and betrayal are revealed, lines between allies and enemies blur, and Octavian's trust in his closest friends is shaken. As an unexpected darkness descends over Alexandria, signs of an imminent solar eclipse begin to unravel secrets and unleash events that Octavian had never anticipated. The search for the truth takes him on a perilous journey through ancient Egyptian lore, the city's underground catacombs, and the treacherous waters of the Nile.  Despite the imminent threat to his life and sanity, Octavian becomes increasingly obsessed with solving the enigma. The more he learns, however, the greater he fears the implications of the Order's doings. In the end, the emerging truth propels Octavian into a race against time as he unearths a cataclysmic secret that threatens not only Alexandria but the entire world. Will Octavian manage to unravel the mystery surrounding the Order of Thoth and expose the hidden connections and motives of Apollodorus? Or will the consequences of discovering the greatest secret in history finally catch up to him, paving the path to darkness? \\"The Shadow of Apollodorus\\" entwines the thrilling elements of ancient history, political intrigue, and action to craft a cinematic experience that keeps the viewer captivated and spellbound from start to finish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive.  - Microsoft Office is an office suite of applications, servers, and services developed by Microsoft. It was first announced by Bill Gates on 1 August 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for a bundled set of applications, the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, OLE data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand. On 10 July 2012, Softpedia reported that Office is used by over a billion people worldwide.  - Redmond is a city in King County, Washington, United States, located east of Seattle, within the Seattle metropolitan area. The population is 60,560 in 2016, an increase from the 2010 census, up from 45,256 in 2000 census. Redmond is commonly recognized as the home of Microsoft and Nintendo of America. With an annual bike race on city streets and the state's only velodrome, Redmond is also known as the \\"Bicycle Capital of the Northwest\\".  - An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.  - Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system.  - Internet Explorer (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer and Windows Internet Explorer, commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a discontinued series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included as part of the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.  - Robert Alan Soloway is the founder of the so - called \`\` Strategic Partnership Against Microsoft Illegal Spam , '' or SPAMIS , but is said to be one of the Internet 's biggest spammers through his company , Newport Internet Marketing ( NIM ) . He was arrested on May 30 , 2007 , after a grand jury indicted him on charges of identity theft , money laundering , and mail , wire , and e-mail fraud . He was nicknamed the \`\` Spam King '' by prosecutors .  - In common usage, theft is the taking of another person's property or services without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. The word is also used as an informal shorthand term for some crimes against property, such as burglary, embezzlement, larceny, looting, robbery, shoplifting, library theft, and fraud (\\"i.e.\\", obtaining money under false pretenses). In some jurisdictions, theft is considered to be synonymous with larceny; in others, theft has replaced larceny. Someone who carries out an act of or makes a career of theft is known as a thief. The act of theft is also known by other terms such as stealing, thieving, and filching.  - Consumer electronics or home electronics are electronic or digital equipment intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD players, DVD movies, iPods, video games, remote control cars, etc.), communications (telephones, cell phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g., desktop computers, printers, paper shredders, etc.). In British English, they are often called brown goods by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from \\"white goods\\" such as washing machines and refrigerators. In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large big box consumer electronics stores, such as Best Buy, which sell both entertainment, communications, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. Consumer electronics stores differ from professional audio stores in that the former sells consumer-grade electronics for private use, whereas the latter sells professional-grade electronics designed for use by audio engineers and audio technicians.  - Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else's identity, usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person's name, and perhaps to the other person's disadvantage or loss. The person whose identity has been assumed may suffer adverse consequences if they are held responsible for the perpetrator's actions. Identity theft occurs when someone uses another's personally identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term \\"identity theft\\" was coined in 1964.  - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play.  - A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An \\"information resource\\" is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) that may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content. Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.  - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile.  - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.  - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies.  - In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. Fraud itself can be a civil wrong (i.e., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud and/or recover monetary compensation), a criminal wrong (i.e., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities) or it may cause no loss of money, property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, such as obtaining a driver's license or qualifying for a mortgage by way of false statements.  - Terrorism financing refers to activities that provides financing or financial support to individual terrorists or terrorist groups. A government that maintains a list of terrorist organizations normally will also pass laws to prevent money laundering being used to finance those organizations.  - Grand jury is a legal body empowered to conduct official proceedings and investigate potential criminal conduct, and determine whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may compel the production of documents and compel sworn testimony of witnesses to appear before it. Grand jury is separate from the courts, which do not preside over its functioning.  - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

Solve -3*q = 16*q + 19 for q.","output":"To solve the equation -3*q = 16*q + 19 for q, follow these steps: Step 1: Get all terms with 'q' on one side of the equation. To do this, add 3*q to both sides of the equation. -3*q + 3*q = 16*q + 19 + 3*q This simplifies to: 0 = 19*q + 19 Step 2: Isolate the 'q' term. Now, subtract 19 from both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the other side. 19*q + 19 - 19 = 0 - 19 This simplifies to: 19*q = -19 Step 3: Solve for 'q'. Now, divide both sides of the equation by 19 to get the value of 'q'. 19*q / 19 = -19 / 19 This simplifies to: q = -1 So, the solution for the equation -3*q = 16*q + 19 is q = -1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which scientist read less about dairying ants milking the aphids?  Pam and Ellie are two entomologists. they are both studying ants at the moment: Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, while Pam is studying ants that farm aphids.  Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators. The answer is:","output":"To answer this question correctly, let's first examine the information given about the two entomologists and their areas of study: 1. Pam is studying ants that farm aphids. 2. Ellie is studying leafcutter ants. Now, let's consider the information pertaining to dairying ants milking aphids: - Dairying ants milk aphids by stroking them with their antennae. - The ants protect the aphids, and there is a mutualistic relationship between them. - Some farming ant species gather and store aphid eggs and transport newly hatched aphids. Since Pam is studying ants that farm aphids, she is more likely to read about dairying ants and their relationship with aphids. Ellie, on the other hand, is focused on leafcutter ants, which do not involve dairying ants milking aphids. Therefore, the correct answer is: Ellie read less about dairying ants milking the aphids."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In modern Georgian prose only Konstantine Gamsakhurdia could aspire to the same international level . ''  - Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \\"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\\" (original Swedish: \\"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning\\"). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \\"work\\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  - The Charterhouse of Parma is a novel by Stendhal published in 1839. Telling the story of an Italian nobleman in the Napoleonic era and later, it was admired by Balzac, Tolstoy, André Gide and Henry James. The novel has been adapted for opera, film and television.  - Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola (2 April 1840  29 September 1902) was a French novelist, playwright, journalist, the best-known practitioner of the literary school of naturalism, and an important contributor to the development of theatrical naturalism. He was a major figure in the political liberalization of France and in the exoneration of the falsely accused and convicted army officer Alfred Dreyfus, which is encapsulated in the renowned newspaper headline \\"J'accuse\\". Zola was nominated for the first and second Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901 and 1902.  - Le Rouge et le Noir (French for The Red and the Black) is a historical psychological novel in two volumes by Stendhal, published in 1830.

He ultimately allows his passions to betray him.  - Konstantine Gamsakhurdia (May 3, 1893  July 17, 1975) was a Georgian writer and public figure, who, along with Mikheil Javakhishvili, is considered to be one of the most influential Georgian novelists of the 20th century. Educated and first published in Germany, he married Western European influences to purely Georgian thematic to produce his best works, such as \\"The Right Hand of the Grand Master\\" and \\"David the Builder\\". Hostile to the Soviet rule, he was, nevertheless, one of the few leading Georgian writers to have survived the Stalin-era repressions, including his exile to a White Sea island and several arrests. His works are noted for their character portrayals of great psychological insight. Another major feature of Gamsakhurdia's writings is a new subtlety he infused into Georgian diction, imitating an archaic language to create a sense of classicism.  - Mikheil Javakhishvili (birth surname: Adamashvili ) (8 November 1880  30 September 1937) was a Georgian novelist who is regarded as one of the top twentieth-century Georgian writers.

In modern Georgian prose only Konstantine Gamsakhurdia could aspire to the same international level.\\"  - Alfred Dreyfus (9 October 1859  12 July 1935) was a French Jewish artillery officer whose trial and conviction in 1894 on charges of treason became one of the most tense political dramas in modern French history with a wide echo in all Europe. Known today as the Dreyfus affair, the incident eventually ended with Dreyfus' complete exoneration.  - Marie-Henri Beyle (23 January 1783  23 March 1842), better known by his pen name Stendhal (or ; in English , , or ), was a 19th-century French writer. Best known for the novels \\"Le Rouge et le Noir\\" (\\"The Red and the Black\\", 1830) and \\"La Chartreuse de Parme\\" (\\"The Charterhouse of Parma\\", 1839), he is highly regarded for the acute analysis of his characters' psychology and considered one of the earliest and foremost practitioners of realism.  - Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) is a public research university in London, England, and a constituent college of the federal University of London. It dates back to the foundation of London Hospital Medical College in 1785.

It is important to avoid openly argument or disagreement. This will only make them angry or, worse, lead them to turn on or undermine you. Try instead to anticipate. Imagine what sort of demands they might spring. This will allow you to be prepared upfront without having to enter a confrontation or give ground, both of which, in view of narcissists’ inability to empathize, could be disastrous for your business relationship. Choose your words carefully. A narcissist will read criticism into very innocuous comments, resulting in a tantrum or a potentially damaging, unprofessional display. Tread lightly around a controlling business partner or client, knowing that the least word could set them off. You might not have a choice about dealing with a client, and your job may depend on getting along with them. Literally watch what you say, as well: take down the minutes of your meetings and telephone calls. Communicate very clearly about your project, timetables, and your client’s expectations. This will give you support in case they make new demands or accuse you of breaking an agreement. Controlling people are often perfectionists; some of them, like Steve Jobs, are indeed visionaries. In a business situation it may be best to play to your controlling client’s narcissistic tendencies. Stroke their ego without being servile. For example, lead them to think that your ideas and suggestions are really their own. Try to finesse them to the desired end rather than being goaded into an argument. The perfectionism of a controlling client will make it difficult to please. Expect constant demands on your time and to hear that your work is not good enough. Do not be surprised if the client tries to threaten or bully you or to accuse you of mismanagement. Challenging a narcissist will get you nowhere because, to them, they are always right and you are always wrong. By the same token, however, do not show hesitation or weakness.

Information:  - An amusement park (sometimes referred to as a funfair) or theme park is a group of entertainment attractions, rides, and other events in a location for the enjoyment of large numbers of people. Amusement parks have a fixed location, as opposed to travelling funfairs and traveling carnivals, and are more elaborate than simple city parks or playgrounds, usually providing attractions meant to cater specifically to certain age groups, as well as some that are aimed towards all ages. Theme parks, a specific type of amusement park, are usually much more intricately themed to a certain subject or group of subjects than normal amusement parks.  - The Royal Court of Sweden is the official name for the organisation (royal households) that supports the monarch, and the royal house. The incumbent monarch, King Carl XVI Gustaf, is head of the Royal Court.  - During the 6th millennium BC, agriculture spread from the Balkans to Italy and Eastern Europe, and also from Mesopotamia to Egypt. World population was essentially stable at numbers ranging between approximately 5 and 7 million.  - Skansen (the Sconce) is the first open-air museum and zoo in Sweden and is located on the island Djurgården in Stockholm, Sweden. It was opened on 11 October 1891 by Artur Hazelius (18331901) to show the way of life in the different parts of Sweden before the industrial era.  - The Stockholm archipelago is the largest archipelago in Sweden, and the second-largest archipelago in the Baltic Sea (the largest being across the Baltic in Finland).  - Djurgården or, more officially, Kungliga Djurgården is an island in central Stockholm. Djurgården is home to historical buildings and monuments, museums, galleries, the amusement park Gröna Lund, the open-air museum Skansen, the small residential area \\"Djurgårdsstaden\\", yacht harbours, and extensive stretches of forest and meadows. It is one of the Stockholmers' favorite recreation areas and tourist destinations alike, attracting over 10 million visitors per year, of which some 5 million come to visit the museums and amusement park. The island belongs to the National City park founded in 1995. Since the 15th century the Swedish monarch has owned or held the right of disposition of Royal Djurgården. Today, this right is exercised by the Royal Djurgården Administration which is a part of the Royal Court of Sweden.  - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\").

It borders Uppsala County and Södermanland County. It also borders Mälaren and the Baltic Sea. The city of Stockholm is the capital of Sweden. Stockholm County is divided by the historic provinces of Uppland (Roslagen) and Södermanland (Södertörn). More than one fifth of the Swedish population lives in the county. Stockholm County is also one of the statistical \\"riksområden\\" (national areas) according to , Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics within the EU. With more than two million inhabitants, Stockholm is the most densely populated county of Sweden.  - Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. The city is spread across 14 islands on the coast in the southeast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake Mälaren, by the Stockholm archipelago and the Baltic Sea. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by a Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the capital of Stockholm County.  - Rosendal Palace ( Swedish : Rosendals slott ) is a Swedish palace pavilion located at the Djurgården , an island in central Stockholm . It was built between 1823 and 1827 for King Karl XIV Johan , the first Bernadotte King of Sweden . It was intended as an escape from the formalities of court life at the Royal Palace . Rosendal Palace was largely designed by Fredrik Blom , one of the leading architects of the time , who received a royal commission to draw and build the palace building after the original buildings burned down . Fredrik August Lidströmer , Stockholm 's City Architect from 1818 to 1824 , had been King Karl XIV Johan 's primary architect at the construction of the original Rosendal Palace . After it burned down in 1819 , Lidströmer also created the initial drawings for the replacement palace . These were then adapted and redrawn by Fredrik Blom , who had been an assistant to Jonas Lidströmer , father of Fredrik August Lidströmer . The Queen 's Pavilion at Rosendal Palace ( Swedish : Drottningpaviljongen ) ) and Guard 's Cottage ( Swedish : Vaktstugan ) remained entirely the work of Fredrik August Lidströmer . The creation of the Rosendal Palace in the 1820s marked the beginning of the development of Djurgården into a stately residential area . When King Oskar II died in 1907 , his heirs decided to make Rosendal Palace a museum of the Karl Johan period and of the life of Karl XIV Johan . This makes Rosendal Palace a unique documentation of the European Empire style , in Sweden also known as the Karl Johan style . The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared in other parts of Europe . The palace stands today largely as it did in Karl XIV Johan 's lifetime . During the summer months the palace is open to visitors for guided tours .  - Biography. Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers  Eskil, Karl, and Bengt  were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Question: \\"Who took more overall casualties from bombings?\\"  Context: \\"The bombing failed to demoralise the British into surrender or significantly damage the war economy. The eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British production and the war industries continued to operate and expand. The Blitz was only authorised when the Luftwaffe had failed to meet preconditions for a 1940 launch of Operation Sea Lion, the provisionally planned German invasion of Britain. By May 1941 the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the East. In comparison to the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany, the Blitz resulted in relatively few casualties; the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 inflicted some 42,000 civilian deaths, about the same as the entire Blitz.\\"  Answer:","output":"To answer the question \\"Who took more overall casualties from bombings?\\" in the context provided, we need to compare the casualty numbers of the Blitz and the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany. Step 1: Identify the casualties in the Blitz From the context, we know that the entire Blitz resulted in about 42,000 civilian deaths. Step 2: Identify the casualties in the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany The context states that the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 alone inflicted some 42,000 civilian deaths. Additionally, it is mentioned that this number is about the same as the entire Blitz. However, it is important to note that this comparison is only for the Hamburg bombing, and there might have been other bombings during the Allied campaign against Germany which led to additional casualties. Step 3: Compare casualties Based on the information provided, we can conclude that the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany likely took more overall casualties from bombings as the number of casualties in the Hamburg bombing alone equals the entire Blitz, and there were likely further casualties from other bombings in the campaign."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Man ‘suffered great pain, shock and mental anguish’ after police shot beloved dog, lawsuit claims In an interview with the Record last year, Igor Vukobratovic recalled the aftermath of the shooting that killed his family’s dog, Otto. “He looked at me, and I couldn’t do anything. I was screaming at them, ‘Why would you guys do this?’ I couldn’t believe that they’d just shot my dog,” he told the New Jersey newspaper. “I had to pick him up, he was bleeding, and carry him to the [animal control officer’s] truck. The last thing he saw was me. I was expecting to lose him to old age — not to come home and see him shot in my back yard.” Otto, a 5-year-old German shepherd, died after the April 2015 incident in Wyckoff, N.J., which unfolded after a police officer responding to a call mistakenly walked up to the wrong house. The officer would claim that Otto lunged at him during the encounter and bit his boot. That prompted the officer to open fire on the dog. Otto died from the injuries. After the shooting, the local police chief told NJ.com that the officer was “extremely distraught” but had “every right to be prepared to defend himself.” Now, more than a year after Otto’s death, another member of the Vukobratovic family, Goran Vukobratovic, has filed suit, claiming that he has suffered “great pain, shock and mental anguish” after the dog’s death. The lawsuit — which names police officer Kyle Ferreira, as well as the Wyckoff Police Department and the Township of Wyckoff, N.J. — was filed in Bergen County Superior Court late last month, NJ.com reports. It seeks damages, and claims that Ferreira, who was reportedly cleared after an internal investigation, wasn’t adequately supervised. The police department did not immediately respond to an email sent Thursday evening. An attorney for Goran Vukobratovic, who NJ Advance Media describes as Igor’s father, also did not return a telephone message. “I’m very familiar with the case,” Wyckoff Mayor Kevin Rooney told NJ Advance Media. “However, other than a tort claim notice filed last year as normal procedure when litigation is [threatened], the township has not been served with any updated notice of action.” Dispatch recordings from the day of the incident help explain how the shooting occurred. A dispatcher put out a report about a possible break-in, which apparently happened days earlier, CBS New York reported. An officer tried to repeat the address back after he heard it, the station reported, but that officer said the wrong house number, 622 instead of 621. After the shooting, NJ Advance Media obtained the internal affairs report from Wyckoff police, which included statements made to investigators who looked into the matter. In those statements, Ferreira says that after knocking on the home’s door, he started to walk around the property, looking for signs of a burglary. After walking through an unlocked gate on the right side of the fence, Ferreira told internal affairs that he worked his way around to the back. He didn’t see anything that would indicate a dog lived at the home, he said, but did notice an open window. That’s when he pulled out his gun. But as Ferreira continued, he said in his statement that he heard “an aggressive barking coming from inside the house which sounded like a larger dog.” “I quickly stepped back, turned towards the barking, and saw a full-grown German Shepherd jump out the window and start charging at me in an aggressive manner,” he said, according to NJ.com. “At this time he was less than 10 feet from me. I immediately sprinted in the direction of the side gate to try and escape, but only made it to the edge of the patio before the dog attacked me.” In interviews, however, Igor Vukobratovic has described Otto as a protective but friendly dog who wasn’t prone to attacks, and he has pointed out that it wasn’t an active burglary scene.

A Facebook page about the incident, called “Justice for Otto,” includes a photo album called “evidence,” and the family in May 2015 set up an online fundraising account for the “impending costs of legal aid required to hold the Wyckoff Police Department accountable for needlessly killing the Vukobratovic’s beloved German Shepard, Otto.” “It is clear the Wyckoff Police Department are not interested in taking responsibility for their actions and there is no recourse for the Vukobratovic’s outside of seeking legal counsel,” stated the fundraising page, which describes Otto as an “obedient family pet” with a “loving, playful, friendly” disposition.

Economy of Greece: World War II (1939-1945) devastated the country's economy, but the high levels of economic growth that followed from 1950 to 1980 have been called the Greek economic miracle. From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average, peaking at 5.8% in 2003 and 5.7% in 2006. The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis, a central focus of the wider European debt crisis, plunged the economy into a sharp downturn, with real GDP growth rates of −0.3% in 2008, −4.3% in 2009, −5.5% in 2010, −9.1% in 2011, −7.3% in 2012 and −3.2% in 2013. In 2011, the country's public debt reached €356 billion (172% of nominal GDP). After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector, Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to €280 billion (137% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2012.

Title: Another Formulaic Plot For Talentless Presley Review: I've come to the conclusion that Elvis fans are simpletons. Here's another in a long, line of Presley vehicles that combines a juvenile plot, silly acting, and endless three chord songs with inane lyrics. This guy's acting was worse than his singing---and that's saying something. The most conspicuous thing about the movie is the amount of grease is Presley's hair and the repetitiveness of his monosyllabic dialogue. He was a real cornball with a gnat's IQ and no talent. Truly, do his idol-worshipping fans realize that Presley's IQ was under 80? If it wasn't for Colonel Parker, Presley would have spent the rest of his days driving trucks and eating fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches. Uh huh, uh huh. Answer: Available choices: A). No; B). Yes; Answer:","output":"A). No; Steps and justification: 1. First, analyze the given review's content.

Movie title: Guilty Conscience Movie plot: Arthur Jamison is a very successful ruthless lawyer. He wants to bump off his wife and spends most of the movie talking to an imaginary alter-ego, protrayed by Anthony Hopkins also. He goes though several ideas and plans while each is disected and foiled by this alter-ego in court like cross examination. The biggest problem in the plans is finding a solid alibi (latin for being elsewhere according to Arthur). All his ideas so far have too many loopholes that he cannot close during cross (I mean self) examination.Arthur has had countless affairs and he has decided to get out of his marriage by doing in Louise (played by Blythe Danner), his wife.Only one problem, Louise has done a little homework on her own and has discovered that Arthur has pulled some pretty shady deals that could get him arrested and/or disbarred if brought to light. She has gathered her own evidence and put it in a safe deposit box in the bank. So Louise decides to blackmail Arthur because she sign a prenup where she would get nothing in the course of a normal divorce.Arthur thinks about faking a robbery, suicide, accidents and all kinds of olther scenarios to take care of Louise.

The answer is:","output":"Anthony Hopkins, in the movie Guilty Conscience, is worried about divorce causing him to pay for the consequences of his shady deals and actions, as well as potentially losing his professional career. The character, Arthur Jamison, had signed a prenuptial agreement with his wife, Louise (played by Blythe Danner), which would leave her without any financial compensation in the case of a divorce. However, Louise has discovered information about Arthur's illegal activities and his countless affairs, deciding to use this information to blackmail him instead of pursuing a divorce. Arthur's main concern is figuring out how to free himself from this predicament. He contemplates various scenarios, such as faking a robbery, suicide, or accidents to eliminate Louise. However, each plan comes with its own set of challenges and is ultimately dismissed by his alter-ego, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins as well. The alter-ego serves as a voice of reason in the movie, scrutinizing each plan and pointing out the loopholes that could jeopardize Arthur's alibi. As the storyline unfolds, it becomes evident that Arthur's girlfriend, Jackie (played by Swoosie Kurtz), knows both Arthur and Louise. She has uncovered Arthur's multiple affairs, and in a twist of events, partners with Louise to enact revenge on Arthur. They devise their own plan to kill Arthur and establish an alibi for Louise. The main theme running through Guilty Conscience is the exploration of various potential means of escaping the consequences of one's actions. The character of Arthur Jamison serves as an embodiment of the question: what are the moral, legal, and personal risks associated with trying to avoid paying for one's mistakes and deceptions? The movie becomes a mental chess match between Arthur and his alter-ego, as well as those around him, as he tries to find the perfect plan to extricate himself from the perilous situation he has created. To decide whether investing in this film proposal is worthwhile, you may want to consider factors such as the potential audience, the quality of the storyline, the cast, and the potential for critical and financial success. Guilty Conscience offers an engaging plot, interesting character development, and a unique exploration of moral dilemmas, which could make it a compelling choice for investment. Audiences are often drawn to psychological thrillers that delve into the human psyche, and this film fits that mold. Additionally, Anthony Hopkins is a widely acclaimed actor, and his involvement could bring both talent and attention to the project. Before making an investment decision, it is essential to conduct thorough research, analyze the budget, and evaluate the film proposal's overall merit within the industry. Keep in mind that the success of a film is never guaranteed, but by considering the various aspects discussed above, you can make a more informed decision about whether to invest in Guilty Conscience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The siege of Cuzco was waged until the following spring, and during that time Manco's armies managed to wipe out four relief columns sent from Lima, but was ultimately unsuccessful in its goal of routing the Spaniards from the city. The Inca leadership did not have the full support of all its subject peoples and furthermore, the degrading state of Inca morale coupled with the superior Spanish siege weapons soon made Manco Inca realize his hope of recapturing Cuzco was failing. Manco Inca eventually withdrew to Tambo.:239-247 After the Spanish regained control of Cuzco, Manco Inca and his armies retreated to the fortress at Ollantaytambo where he, for a time, successfully launched attacks against Pizarro based at Cuzco and even managed to defeat the Spanish in an open battle.:247-249 When it became clear that defeat was imminent, Manco Inca retreated further to the mountainous region:259 of Vilcabamba and established the small Neo-Inca State, where Manco Inca and his successors continued to hold some power for several more decades. His son, Túpac Amaru, was the last Inca. After deadly confrontations, he was murdered by the Spanish in 1572. In total, the conquest took about forty years to complete. Many Inca attempts to regain the empire had occurred, but none had been successful. Thus the Spanish conquest was achieved through relentless force, and deception, aided by factors like smallpox and a great communication and cultural divide. The Spaniards destroyed much of the Incan culture and introduced the Spanish culture to the native population. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the location of the structure that was built for Marquess of Annandale?  Despite William Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth.

He converces schizophrenically with himself via tape recordings of his own voice. He is also being hounded by Randy (Pier Luigi Conti), a shady loan shark whom he owes money to after accruing bad gambling debts.Lester picks up a certain Maggie MacDonald (Sasha Darwin), an obnoxious, hysterical, mustached, sexually frustrated alcoholic, whom he invites over at his house for dinner. His attempt to poison her is thwarted because she is already so drunk when she arrives at his place that she spills her glass of wine onto the floor. On the next attempt, she giddily mixed up his glass of wine with hers. He finally loses patience on the third try when she swallows the poisoned glassful, only to vomit before it can take effect. As Maggie excuses herself to the bathroom to clean up, he attacks her with a wooden stick. Her scalp splits apart and she runs screaming from the bathroom with blood streaming down her face. He chases her down the corridor bashing her head repeatedly, causing skin to rip away from her face, and a single bloodshot eyeball to roll out of her right eye socket onto the floor.Playing dead for a few seconds, Maggie rises when Parson's back is turned and makes another mad dash for the front door, but is rounded up and punched unconscious. Furious and exhausted, the killer shoves her head into a over and switches it on, leaving her slumped with her flesh slowly melting off her face. Dead at last, Parson shoves Maggie's body into the trunk of his Mercedes.

Fact 2: Potted plants in season include chrysanthemums, daisies and cyclamen.  Given the two facts above, what exhibits phototropism? The answer is:","output":"Plants exhibit phototropism, which is the growth and movement of plants in response to a light source. In the context of the two facts provided, it can be inferred that chrysanthemums, daisies, and cyclamen, as potted plants in season, would also exhibit phototropism. Phototropism is a crucial mechanism for plants to optimize their exposure to sunlight and maximize photosynthesis, which is essential for their growth and survival. This phenomenon is primarily driven by the presence of light-sensitive pigments in plants called photoreceptors, which include phytochromes and cryptochromes. These photoreceptors respond to specific wavelengths of light, such as red, blue, or far-red light. When photoreceptors detect light in the environment, they trigger a cascade of signaling events in the plant cells, leading to changes in gene expression, hormone production, and cellular growth. Among these hormones, auxins play a significant role in regulating phototropic responses. They are primarily produced in the apical meristems (growing tips) of shoots and roots and are transported along the length of the plant. In the case of positive phototropism, such as in the shoots of chrysanthemums, daisies, and cyclamen, the auxins accumulate on the side of the plant that is furthest away from the light source. This causes the cells on that side to elongate more than the cells on the side facing the light. As a result, the plants bend toward the light. On the other hand, negative phototropism occurs in plant roots, where the growth is directed away from the light source. This helps the roots anchor the plant in the soil and search for water and essential nutrients in the dark. In conclusion, given the two facts above, chrysanthemums, daisies, and cyclamen as potted plants in season exhibit phototropism as they respond to light stimuli and reorient their growth toward the light source. This response is crucial for their survival and overall health, allowing them to maximize sunlight exposure, optimize photosynthesis, and efficiently use available resources in their environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This is a correct answer to the following question about The Trial. Yes or no? Answer: Because of this there are certain inconsistencies which exist within the novel, such as disparities in timing in addition to other discontinuities in narration. Question: how is kafka like the trial A:","output":"Yes, the statement provided does indicate that there are certain inconsistencies present within the novel \\"The Trial\\" by Franz Kafka. However, to fully address the question, \\"How is Kafka like 'The Trial'?\\", it is important to delve deeper into the relationship between the author, Franz Kafka, and his famous novel. Franz Kafka, an early 20th-century Czech-born author writing in German, is often considered one of the most influential writers of modern fiction. His works, which often feature elements of existentialism, surrealism, and the struggle against an overbearing, labyrinthine bureaucracy, are known for their nightmarish, often unsettling atmosphere.  \\"The Trial,\\" written in 1914-15 and published posthumously in 1925, is the story of Josef K., a man who is arrested and accused of a crime without being informed of the nature of the charges. Throughout the novel, K. is subject to an opaque and convoluted justice system that he must navigate in an attempt to clear his name. The confusing and absurd nature of this labyrinthine justice system creates moments of inconsistency and discontinuity within the narrative, as mentioned in the provided answer statement. Kafka's life had a significant impact on his work, and many elements of \\"The Trial\\" can be seen as reflections of his personal experiences and feelings. Kafka's relationship with his overbearing father, his fear of bureaucratic authority, and his feelings of alienation can be seen throughout this novel. In this way, Kafka is very much like \\"The Trial,\\" as the novel exemplifies many of his inner struggles and insecurities. Moreover, Kafka's professional background played a role in shaping \\"The Trial.\\" For most of his life, Kafka worked at an insurance company that dealt with complex legal matters. This provided him with intimate knowledge of bureaucracy, which is evident in the novel's complex and at times indecipherable legal system. Kafka not only had to deal with bureaucracies in his professional life but also faced them in his struggle to get his works published. His difficulties in navigating the literary world added to the sense of despair and entrapment that is a defining feature of \\"The Trial.\\" Furthermore, both Kafka and \\"The Trial\\" share a similar tone and style of writing characterized by a sense of uncertainty, ambiguity, and disorientation. Kafka's writing, known for these traits, is often called \\"Kafkaesque.\\" In \\"The Trial,\\" the nightmarish, dreamlike quality, the sense of hopelessness, and the lack of resolution are all emblematic of Kafka's unique style. In conclusion, Kafka is intrinsically connected to \\"The Trial\\" in multiple ways. The novel not only reflects some of the author's personal experiences and struggles but also represents the distinctive style and tone of his work. The presence of inconsistencies and discontinuities within the novel could be seen as elements of Kafka's own life, as well as part of his signature style that creates a surreal and disorientating experience for the reader. Ultimately, it appears that both Kafka's life and writing style are interwoven with the themes and structure of \\"The Trial.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Scientific Progress Most scientific progress is the result of careful consideration of work that has already been done. The wonderful world which lies before us today has been put up by hardworking men with clear heads and inventive mind, and these who follow them along life's road will improve on their efforts. It is sometimes necessary to question and even to disbelieve some of the statements made by experts. Action or experiment can often end an argument or achieve a breakthrough. When men were wondering whether it was possible to reach India by sailing westwards from Europe, and whether there was any land on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Christopher Columbus decides to act. He gathered some men, invited them to go on board his three ships, and set out across the dangerous waters of the Atlantic Ocean. He was successful in finding land, but it was not India. The result of his action was that the arguments came to the end. Any young man who wishes to do research must be courageous enough to question old beliefs and do some original thinking about them. Although we seem to know so much, there are many things we don't know. Even when we pull an atom to pieces, we do not really know what the pieces are, we often do not reach the reality behind what we discover, and the more we learn, the better we realize our ignorance.

It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift! I learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man’s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip.

There are so many things to see, new people to meet and memories to create. To help you embrace your new surroundings and make the transition smoother, here are some tips to consider that will help you form a routine, make new friends, and create a bucket list in your new neighborhood. 1. Explore Your New Area One of the first things you should do when moving to a new area is to explore your surroundings. Take a walk around the neighborhood, discover local parks, shops, restaurants, and community events. This will not only familiarize you with your new environment but also help you feel more comfortable in your new space. 2. Take Lots of Photos Documenting your new experiences is a great way to keep the memories alive and appreciate the little things in life. Take lots of photos of the places you discover, the people you meet, and the moments you share. These photos will act as a visual diary, allowing you to look back on your journey and reminisce about the highlights of your new location. 3. Form a Routine Establishing a routine can provide a sense of stability and make adapting to new surroundings a little easier. Create a schedule that incorporates your work, exercise, socializing, and leisure activities to help you transition into your new life. Remember, maintaining a routine can create a sense of normalcy, but don’t forget to be flexible and adapt as you continue to settle in. 4. Make New Friends One of the best ways to feel at home in a new area is to make new friends and form connections with people around you. Attend local events, join clubs or interest groups, and participate in community activities to meet new people. These connections can offer support, encouragement, and camaraderie as you navigate your new environment. 5. Treat Yourself Moving to a new area can be stressful, and it’s important to take care of yourself mentally and physically. Don’t forget to treat yourself once in a while to help you unwind and appreciate the journey you’ve embarked on. This can be as simple as enjoying a meal at a local restaurant, indulging in a spa day, or taking a mini-vacation to a nearby city. 6. Make a Bucket List Creating a bucket list for your new location is an excellent way to discover new places and experiences you might not have considered. Research unique attractions, historical landmarks, and local events to identify the must-visit spots in your area. Your bucket list will serve as a constant reminder of the excitement and adventure waiting for you. Conclusion Transitioning to a new neighborhood isn't always easy, but by embracing your new environment, developing a routine, forming connections and treating yourself along the way, you can make this fresh start an experience to remember. So, take a deep breath, smile, and embrace the endless possibilities that your new community has to offer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing American patriot actor -- one that believes his work (and politics) are as crucial to the American people as the opinions of the President himself.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which land had fewer soil microorganisms consuming oxygen faster than diffusion occurs?  Owen inherited two pieces of land. The Eastern land was covered in wetlands, not very good for building or farming on it, but the Western land had a good rich soil good for agriculture.  Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Answer:","output":"The Eastern land had fewer soil microorganisms consuming oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. This is because the Eastern land was covered in wetlands, which are characterized by the presence of hypoxic soils as a result of soil microorganisms consuming oxygen faster than diffusion occurs."},{"instruction":"You are given a short text as a title.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.  Story: John has to live in the tundra for six months. He is preparing for the harsh arctic winter. He bought three bags of foods, bag A, bag B, and bag C. He kept bag A on his table top. Just out of curiosity, he applied the sugaring method he learned from the internet on bag B and bag C foods. Afterwards, he kept the bag B foods in a place with no moisture, and the bag C foods in a place with high moisture.  Question: Will bag B foods be first dehydrated or not dehydrated?

Q:Given the below context:  Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families  within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and...  Guess a valid title for it!

Write some highlights for the following article: The Washington Redskins, stinging from a letter by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and dozens of fellow Democrats calling on the league to force the team to change its racist name, apparently fumbled a desperate Twitter appeal to fans. \\"Tweet @SenatorReid to show your #RedskinsPride and tell him what the team means to you,\\" the maligned team wrote to its 305,000 Twitter followers on Thursday. But be careful what you ask for, especially on Twitter. \\"This team has ZERO self-awareness.lol,\\" one person tweeted. \\"Lifelong 'Skins fan and I strongly believe it is time to change the name,\\" wrote another. \\"How do you not see what a bad idea this is,\\" said another tweet. \\"Please don't do this to yourself. DON'T,\\" another person wrote. Faiz Shakir, Reid's digital director, said the majority of responses favored a name change. \\"In the five to 10 minutes following it, we were pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming outpouring  of opposition to the team,\\" he said. \\"It was 50 to one at one point.\\" Redskins spokesman Tony Wyllie said the claim reminded him of the famously incorrect \\"Dewey defeats Truman\\" banner headline. \\"They declared victory within the hour and as the night went on, more and more momentum swung our way,\\" he said. \\"That's the good thing about our country. People can express themselves and have a healthy dialogue.\\" In a letter to the NFL last week, the senators stepped up pressure on the league to force the Washington Redskins to change their name by invoking the heated racial controversy triggered by basketball's Donald Sterling. \\"I would hope that the team does reflect on why there was so much organic opposition to the name,\\" Shakir said Friday.  \\"I don't know if they're living in bunker mentality over there and don't realize that this name has caused so much anger. But if they are in that bunker mentality, hopefully (Thursday's Twitter response) causes them to climb out of that and see the fact that there is a lot of deep-seeded opposition and anger to the name.\\" Responding to the senators' letter, Redskins President Bruce Allen invited Reid to a game to \\"witness first-hand that the Washington Redskins are a positive, unifying force for our community in a city and region that is divided on so many levels.\\" Allen said the term Redskins originated as a Native American expression of solidarity, and that the team logo was designed by Native Americans. Joel Barkin, a spokesman for Oneida Indian Nation of central New York, said the team's Twitter appeal demonstrated how much the Redskins underestimate the passions surrounding the issue. \\"This is a complete disregard for those that are calling for a change,\\" he said. \\"It's a fundamental misreading of the issue at large.\\" Last week's letter, signed by 50 Democratic senators and released by Reid, urged pro football's commissioner, Roger Goodell, to take action over concerns that continued use of the Redskins brand is offensive to Native Americans. They asked Goodell to follow the lead of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who took tough measures against Sterling after the longtime owner of the league's Los Angeles Clippers was recorded making comments offensive to African-Americans. \\"Today, we urge you and the National Football League to send the same clear message as the NBA did: that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports,\\" the letter said. Responding to the Senate letter, the NFL said last week it has \\"long demonstrated a commitment to progressive leadership\\" on diversity. \\"The intent of the team's name has always been to present a strong, positive and respectful image. The name is not used by the team or the NFL in any other context, though we respect those that view it differently,\\" the league statement said. Lawmakers step into Washington Redskins name fray.

However, he stressed he did not mean a war of religions, but rather a conflict over \\"interests, money, resources\\". He was speaking ahead of his visit to Poland to reporters seeking his comments on the murder of a Catholic priest by French jihadists on Tuesday. Father Jacques Hamel was killed at a morning mass in his church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, northern France. The killing was the latest of a spate of attacks carried out in France and Germany over the past few days and weeks, many of them attributed to Islamist militants. \\"The word we hear a lot is insecurity, but the real word is war,\\" the pontiff said. \\"We must not be afraid to say the truth, the world is at war because it has lost peace. \\"When I speak of war I speak of wars over interests, money, resources, not religion. All religions want peace, it's the others who want war,\\" Pope Francis added. He later arrived in the southern Polish city of Krakow, for a gathering of young Catholics from across the world. The World Youth Day was expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people. Ahead of the visit, the Vatican appears to have toned down criticism of Polish politicians' views of migrants. A Polish bishops' spokesman had blamed \\"inappropriate\\" political discourse for creating an \\"artificial fear of Muslims\\" in the country, according to a report in La Stampa newspaper. But the remarks later appeared to have been removed from the Vatican website. Pope Francis' support for migrants has put him at odds with Poland's anti-immigrant right-wing government, which has refused to take part in an EU deal to take in refugees, citing security reasons. In the Vatican statement, released on 23 July, Fr Pawel Rytel-Andrianik said \\"great fears\\" existed in \\"ethnically homogenous\\" Poland, where the concept of immigration was \\"new, different and strange\\". \\"Unfortunately these fears are fuelled by some political parties, and inappropriate statements made by politicians. There is an artificially created fear of Muslims, understandable indeed in some ways (because of terrorist attacks),\\" La Stampa reported him as saying in remarks that have since been removed. \\"Poland borders Germany, which has a large Muslim population, and on the border they do not run some regular checks,\\" he added. In the apparently revised Vatican statement, Fr Rytel-Andrianik also blamed a lack of public debate or a system for teaching Polish people about diversity in a country where he said foreign-born people make up just 0.4% of the population. In Krakow, the Pope met Polish President Andrzej Duda in the Wawel Castle before retiring for a closed question-and-answer session with the country's bishops in the city's cathedral. Much of Poland's conservative Catholic establishment is uncomfortable with Pope Francis's push for a more flexible and compassionate church. Poland is deploying over 40,000 security personnel for the visit.

(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.  Question: \\"What brought about the perception that California has more safety and health conscious individuals?\\" Response: \\"California has 151,002 health and safety laws.

In the given English sentence, \\"After rehearsal, you'll go home,\\" the main components are the activities – \\"rehearsal\\" and \\"going home\\", and the sequence of these activities is indicated by the word \\"after\\". To translate this sentence into Czech, we can break it down into the main components: 1. Rehearsal - \\"zkouška\\" (feminine noun) 2. After - \\"po\\" (preposition) 3.

Question: How many miles was the lower bound of the width of the EF5 tornado on May 20th, 2013? Context: Oklahoma City has a very active severe weather season from March through June, especially during April and May. Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes, as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been struck by thirteen violent tornadoes, eleven F/EF4s and two F/EF5. On May 3, 1999 parts of southern Oklahoma City and nearby suburban communities suffered from one of the most powerful tornadoes on record, an F5 on the Fujita scale, with wind speeds estimated by radar at 318 mph (510 km/h). On May 20, 2013, far southwest Oklahoma City, along with Newcastle and Moore, was hit again by a EF5 tornado; it was 0.5 to 1.3 miles (0.80 to 2.09 km) wide and killed 23 people. Less than two weeks later, on May 31, another outbreak affected the Oklahoma City area, including an EF1 and an EF0 within the city and a tornado several miles west of the city that was 2.6 miles (4.2 km) in width, the widest tornado ever recorded.

Plot title: La maschera del demonio/Black Sunday Movie plot: In 1630 Russia, Princess Asa (Barbara Steele), a beautiful, dark-haired, young woman is condemned for practicing witchcraft. The grand inquisitor is none other then her estranged brother, Prince Vajda, who renounces his ties to his sister. As the executioner ties her down to the stake, Asa defiantly swears retribution by returning from the dead one day. The executioner positions a spike-lined metal mask over her face. On her brother's command, a swift hammer blow drives the mask into her skull, killing her instantly. She is then interred in the family crypt in a coffin equipped with a window, thought which the sign of the cross is visible. With the cross forever visible to her lifeless body, it is said that the witch will never return to life.200 years later, Doctors Kruvejan (Andrea Checchi) and Gorovek (John Richardson) are riding in a carriage from St. Petersburg to Moscow on their way to a medical conference. A wheel on the carriage slips out of its socket. Leaving the driver to repair the damage, the pair decide to investigate an old ruined chapel nearby, where they discover the witch's coffin in the crypt below. Kruvejan is suddenly attacked by a large bat, and when he beats it to death in his cane, he accidentally smashes the stone cross position over the window. The fragments from the cross smash the glass, enabling Kruvejan to pull away the witch's mask. Her face is sunken and decayed, but is otherwise intact. Gorovek convinces his friend to leave before the driver becomes overly anxious, but unbeknownst to both, blood from a small cut on Kruvejans hand is already working to revive Asa.Outside the chapel, the two doctors are startled by Princess Katia (Barbara Steele in a dual role), the daughter of Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani).

Q:But corrected figures, provided by the U.S. military and published Tuesday by SIGAR, suggest that the actual decline was 17,980. Pentagon officials acknowledged originally providing inaccurate figures to SIGAR because of a failure \\"to account for the transfer of most of the Afghan Border Force from the Afghan National Police to the Afghan National Army,\\" according to a SIGAR statement. According to the new figures, there were 313,728 members of the Afghan defense forces as of January 31, 2018. That compares to a total of 296,409, as previously reported. \\"SIGAR receives all of the (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) personnel strength numbers published in the quarterly report from USFOR-A and has no means of independently verifying them,\\" the statement added. The new figures still amount to a sharp decline. Afghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, reportedly losing about 10,000 personnel, according to reports. SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified. Senior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August. Those success include the increasing capability of the Afghan military, which began conducting airstrikes two years ago. The Afghan air force carries out between four to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. But the Kabul government controls just over half of the country's districts, SIGAR says. Trump's strategy appeared to commit the U.S. to Afghanistan indefinitely.

Every spring, they migrate to the places where they were born.  As they travel back and forth between spawning grounds, they can be caught off of the North American coast, particularly in the Virginia/North Carolina area and off of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and southern Maine. They also congregate in the Eastern Atlantic. Bluefins used to populate the Black Sea, although their population has dropped significantly here. You'll learn about the procedure and about the equipment that you'll need, and you'll learn whether or not the sport is for you. Look online to find charter cruises in your area, particularly around Cape Cod and Cape Hatteras.  Ask the captain whether you get to keep your catch (or if there is a weight limit) or if the fishing is catch and release. Your catch, if you get to keep it, may not be something you can legally sell. Have a plan for what you're going to do with all of this fish--sushi, anyone? Fishing regulations can be very confusing. Call 1-888-USA-TUNA for permits and to explore questions that you may have. Also, know your catch quota. Check with the NFMS for annual daily catch limits. Kite fishing allows an angler to keep a live bait swimming on the surface.  The kite physically lifts the bait, and prevents the bait from swimming downward.  The result is a live bait, virtually half out of the water, swimming and thrashing frantically on the surface-basically ringing the dinner bell for any tuna in the vicinity.

They also congregate in the Eastern Atlantic and were once found in the Black Sea, though their population has dropped significantly there. To begin fishing for bluefin tuna, start by researching charter cruises in your area, particularly around Cape Cod and Cape Hatteras. Inquire about catch limits and whether you can keep your catch or if it's catch-and-release only. Be aware that you may not be legally permitted to sell your catch, so plan for how you'll use the fish (such as preparing sushi). Fishing regulations can be complex, so call 1-888-USA-TUNA for permits and any questions you might have. Check with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NFMS) for annual daily catch limits. A useful technique for catching bluefin tuna is kite fishing, which involves lifting live bait with a kite to keep it swimming on the surface. This attracts tuna to the area as the bait thrashes around in the water. In summary, prepare for your bluefin tuna fishing experience by understanding their migration patterns, identifying prime locations, securing permits, and learning about catch limits. Utilize specialized techniques like kite fishing to increase your odds of success.

In a game that was predicted to be a blowout, with a struggling Eagles defense playing a 10-1 Patriots led by Tom Brady, who led the NFL in passing yards and passing touchdowns. The Eagles held the Patriots to 0 points in the first quarter, but Brady threw a touchdown to James White on the first play of the 2nd quarter, followed by an 11-yard strike to Danny Amendola to make the game 14-0. New England tried an onside kick to surprise Philadelphia, but the special teams were ready and recovered it, giving the Eagles ideal field position. Bradford took advantage of this with a 5-yard touchdown to Zach Ertz next drive, but could not get going following the drive. With 15 seconds left, New England looked poised to end the half with a 7-point lead, but Chris Maragos blocked a punt that middle linebacker Najee Goode took back 24 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, Brady drove the ball to the five yard line, but free safety Malcolm Jenkins had other plans, catching an interception and running it back for a 100-yard pick six. Next drive, New England was forced to punt, which Darren Sproles took back 83 yards for a touchdown. Next drive, Brady threw an end zone pick to cornerback Byron Maxwell, who went down in the end zone for a touchback. In a drive set up by Maxwell's INT that lasted well into the fourth quarter, Bradford threw a TD to Jordan Matthews, and the Eagles were leading 35-14. Enraged fans started to leave the stadium, but soon the lead would thicken as the Patriots scored, recovered an onside kick, and scored again, turning things to make the score 35-28 with 3 minutes left. Riley Cooper batted the next onside kick out of bounds to secure the Eagles possession. After 3rd string running back Kenjon Barner fumbled with slightly over a minute left, Tom Brady and the undermanned Patriots' offense attempted to rally to tie the game, but dropped passes by Martin and Amendola ultimately lead to the underdog Eagles stunning New England and its home crowd. Although Bradford posted very few yards, he threw 2 touchdowns and continued to not turn the ball over. Outside linebackers Connor Barwin and Brandon Graham scored 2 sacks each. DeMarco Murray returned to his shape from weeks 1-4, rushing for 24 yards on 8 carries, which turns into a pitiful 7 carries for 5 yards when you take away his longest run of 19 yards. Darren Sproles stepped up, rushing for 66 yards, receiving for 34 yards, and returning punts for 115 yards and 1 touchdown. With the win, the Eagles go to 5-7, ending a three-game skid and passing the Giants for second place in the NFC East. With a loss by the Washington Redskins, the Eagles' 5-7 record tied them with the Redskins for the best record in the NFC East, but their Week 4 loss kept them in second.

At age 10, she was expelled from her all-white school. The officials' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life. She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film Skin, which won numerous awards. Question: How many generations of European Ancestors does Sandra Laing have?","output":"Sandra Laing's family was able to prove at least three generations of European ancestors. This proof was in an attempt to validate her racial classification as White during the apartheid era in South Africa. Despite having three generations of European ancestry, authorities classified Laing as Coloured due to her skin color and hair texture, causing significant disruptions in her life and her family's lives. This unfortunate experience highlights the injustice and discrimination rampant during those times. Sandra Laing's story is an essential reminder of the role that ancestry and race can play in someone's life, even though these factors may not truly define or directly influence someone's abilities, potential, or character. Such classifications can perpetuate stereotypes and limit opportunities for individuals based on their perceived race. As seen in Laing's case, her expulsion from an all-white school at ten years old was a powerful example of the discrimination experienced by many others during apartheid in South Africa. The 2008 biographical film \\"Skin,\\" which is based on Sandra Laing's life, provides an in-depth look at her journey and the challenges she encountered as a result of her racial classification.

A:","output":"While the phrase \\"Like the other halogens, free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule I2, and then only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygen\\" does provide some information about the nature of iodine, it does not directly answer the question of where iodine can be found. Therefore, it would not be a reasonable answer to the question if the options available are \\"Yes\\" or \\"No.\\" To provide a more detailed and informative response, consider the following: Iodine is a chemical element with the symbol 'I' and atomic number 53, belonging to the halogen group. It is a shiny, grayish-black, metallic-look solid that forms as a diatomic non-polar molecule (I2) in its standard state. Iodine is relatively rare in the Earth's crust, ranking 47th in abundance. It is primarily found in the form of iodide ions (I-) in aqueous solutions and solid salts. The main sources of iodine are: 1. Seawater and marine sediments: Dissolved iodide is present in seawater, usually at concentrations of 50–60 micrograms per liter. Iodine is also found in underwater kelps and seaweeds, which concentrate iodide from seawater. Along coastal areas, marine sediments may contain iodine-rich minerals, particularly in the geologically older strata. 2. Brines and salt deposits: Iodine can also be extracted from brine wells and salt deposits found in underground formations. Brines from underground oil and gas drilling operations can contain significant levels of iodine. 3. Mineral extraction: The extraction of certain minerals like sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, and caliche ores can yield iodine as a byproduct. 4. Food sources: Iodine is essential for human health, and it is found in various food sources, including seafood, seaweed, dairy products, eggs, and iodized salt. To recap, the phrase \\"Like the other halogens, free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule I2, and then only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygen\\" offers some insight into the chemical behavior of iodine, but it does not directly address or answer the question of where to find the element iodine. Instead, for a more proper and relevant response, it is crucial to mention iodine's primary sources, including seawater, marine sediments, brines, salt deposits, and various food items."},{"instruction":"When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.  Space explorers, that launched from Earth, just encountered a new planet several light years away. This planet is almost an exact copy of Earth, but it is currently uninhabited by intelligent life. Upon landing, the explorers name the planet Caprica and begin learning as much as they can. They discover that the species on this Caprica are nearly all the same as on Earth, and even most of the topography looks the same. However, the main difference is that humans never evolved here. For this reason, there are no cities or cars or factories to burn up fossil fuels.  Does Earth have more or less greenhouse gases than Caprica?

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person that agreed with the views of the author of Ordnance Survey of Scotland?, using the article: Neilston experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year. Several lakes and small lochs have formed around Neilston: Long Loch, Loch Libo, and Loch Cawpla. Aboon the Brae (Scots language for \\"above the hill\\") is the site of a spring. There are a number of small named-localities in and around Neilston: Arthurlie, Holehouse, Crofthead, Kirkstyle, Coldoun, Gateside, Hollows, Broadley, Nether Kirkton and Neilstonside.Neilston's built environment is characterised by its mixture of 19th- and 20th-century detached cottages, single and two-story buildings. Several mansion houses were built for the owners of former mills and factories. Many of Neilston's dwellings are painted in whites or ivories. In his book Ordnance Survey of Scotland (1884), Francis Hindes Groome remarked that Neilston \\"presents an old-fashioned yet neat and compact appearance\\", a view echoed by Hugh McDonald in Rambles Round Glasgow (1910), who stated that Neilston \\"is a compact, neat, and withal somewhat old-fashioned little township\\", although continued that it has \\"few features calling for special remark\\". It is frequently described as a quiet dormitory village, although some sources from around the turn of the 20th century describe Neilston as a town. There is a mixture of suburbs, semi-rural, rural and former-industrial locations in Neilston, but overwhelmingly the land use in central Neilston is sub-urban. The territory of Neilston is not contiguous with any other settlement, and according to the General Register Office for Scotland, does not form part of Greater Glasgow, the United Kingdom's fifth largest conurbation., what would be the answer ?","output":"After reading the provided article, the text mentions two authors - Francis Hindes Groome, who wrote \\"Ordnance Survey of Scotland\\" in 1884, and Hugh McDonald, who wrote \\"Rambles Round Glasgow\\" in 1910.

Mary was 70 and she was Ann's aunt. She had a number of health problems. Ann was 52 and quite healthy.  But I can use this background: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well.

She says indigenous farmworkers, driven north by economic hardship, are more likely than Spanish-speakers to be denied wages or forced into substandard housing. Does it follow that \\"Both indigenous farmworkers driven north and Spanish-speakers are denied wages equally.\\"?","output":"Based on the statement provided, it does not necessarily follow that \\"Both indigenous farmworkers driven north and Spanish-speakers are denied wages equally.\\" The initial assertion focuses on outlining that indigenous farmworkers driven north by economic hardship are more likely than Spanish-speakers to face exploitation, such as being denied wages or being forced into substandard housing. This comparative aspect of the statement emphasizes a distinct difference between the two groups with respect to the frequency and likelihood of experiencing these exploitative practices. It is important to consider that the statement underscores a heightened vulnerability faced by indigenous farmworkers in comparison to their Spanish-speaking counterparts. This vulnerability could be linked to various factors such as language barriers, discrimination, cultural differences, legal status, or a lack of access to informational resources and support networks. These elements might put indigenous farmworkers in a more disadvantaged position when negotiating fair terms of employment or when seeking redress against injustices. Furthermore, the statement does not provide explicit quantifiable data to make a conclusive observation about the wage denial rates for both groups. To determine if both groups are being denied wages equally, it would be necessary to analyze comprehensive studies and statistics which detail the prevalence of wage denial among indigenous farmworkers driven north and Spanish-speakers. However, it is worth noting that the statement does not claim that Spanish-speaking farmworkers are immune to wage theft and substandard housing. It is likely that both groups face these issues, but the specific focus of the statement highlights that indigenous farmworkers are at a greater risk. In conclusion, the statement does not provide sufficient information to ascertain that both groups of farmworkers are experiencing an equal rate of wage denial. However, it is evident that indigenous farmworkers are more vulnerable to exploitative practices when compared to Spanish-speakers according to the given statement."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose plan was to portray Glacier as \\"American's Switzerland?\\"  In 1891 the Great Northern Railway crossed the Continental Divide at Marias Pass 5,213 feet (1,589 m), which is along the southern boundary of the park. In an effort to stimulate use of the railroad, the Great Northern soon advertised the splendors of the region to the public. The company lobbied the United States Congress. In 1897 the park was designated as a forest preserve. Under the forest designation, mining was still allowed but was not commercially successful. Meanwhile, proponents of protecting the region kept up their efforts. In 1910, under the influence of the Boone and Crockett Club, spearheaded by Club members George Bird Grinnell, Henry L. Stimson, and the railroad, a bill was introduced into the U.S. Congress which redesignated the region from a forest reserve to a national park. This bill was signed into law by President William Howard Taft on May 11, 1910. In 1910 George Bird Grinnell wrote, \\"This Park, the country owes to the Boone and Crockett Club, whose members discovered the region, suggested it being set aside, caused the bill to be introduced into congress and awakened interest in it all over the country\\". From May until August 1910, the forest reserve supervisor, Fremont Nathan Haines, managed the park's resources as the first acting superintendent. In August 1910, William Logan was appointed the park's first superintendent. While the designation of the forest reserve confirmed the traditional usage rights of the Blackfeet, the enabling legislation of the national park does not mention the guarantees to the Native Americans. It is the position of the United States government that with the special designation as a National Park the mountains ceded their multi-purpose public land status and the former rights ceased to exist as it was confirmed by the Court of Claims in 1935. Some Blackfeet held that their traditional usage rights still exist de jure. In the 1890s, armed standoffs were avoided narrowly several times.The Great Northern Railway, under the supervision of president Louis W....

A:","output":"The title \\"USS Albuquerque (SSN-706)\\" belongs to the category of \\"mean of transportation.\\"  To expound further, the \\"USS Albuquerque (SSN-706)\\" is a specific type of transportation vehicle, classified as a submarine. The \\"USS\\" in the title stands for United States Ship, denoting that it's a commissioned ship of the United States Navy. \\"Albuquerque\\" refers to its name, which is typically chosen to honor cities, states, important figures, or previous ships. In this case, the submarine derives its name from the city of Albuquerque in New Mexico.  \\"SSN\\" stands for Submersible Ship Nuclear - an official US Navy hull classification denoting that this submarine is powered by nuclear propulsion. The number \\"706\\" is its hull number, which is a unique identifier used by the US Navy, making it distinct from all other ships.  The USS Albuquerque specifically belongs to the Los Angeles-class of submarines which were the backbone of the U.S. Navy's submarine force for much of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. These submarines were designed to accomplish a wide range of missions, including anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface ship warfare, strike warfare, special operations, surveillance, irregular warfare, and mine warfare, thus not only serving as means of transportation but also as crucial elements in naval combat.  The USS Albuquerque herself was commissioned in 1983 and served the United States Navy up to her decommissioning and inactivation in 2017. These submarines would typically carry a crew of over 100 officers and enlisted personnel, travelling underwater over vast distances for extended periods, either on patrols or for specific naval missions.  So to sum up, the USS Albuquerque (SSN-706) falls under the category of \\"mean of transportation\\". More accurately, it can be classified as a military watercraft or naval vessel, operating as part of a nation's naval force for both transportation and combat operations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. and British department store buyers are looking for fall and winter trends at New York Fashion Week that will not only lure shoppers back, but excite them enough to pay full price amid a struggling economy. After an abysmal year of retail sales as the United States and Britain suffered their worst recessions in decades, fashion directors at Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Harrods and Liberty told Reuters they felt a growing sense of optimism. When New York Fashion Week starts on Thursday to showcase fall and winter collections for 2010, buyers are planning to be more selective and buy fewer clothes as they push shoppers to pay full price instead of waiting for discount sales. \\"We have all become much more edited and selective in the way that we buy,\\" said Colleen Sherin, fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue. \\"It is making the consumer realize 'I probably cannot wait three months to get this on sale, I need to buy it now and I want to buy it now.'\\" But while shoppers remain cautious about spending, they are not playing it safe when it comes to fashion choices. \\"If she already owns it she's not interested in buying it again ... She is purchasing things to add to her wardrobe to update it with the current message of the season,\\" said Ken Downing, fashion director at Neiman Marcus. \\"Everyone is aware of the economic situation and there's a need to really speak to the customer in a voice that is going to get her excited and ignited when the season rolls round to come into the stores and shop,\\" he said. \\"We want clothes that are so enticing that she wants them at regular price and not waiting for them to be marked down.\\" More than 60 designers will show at the Mercedes Benz New York Fashion Week headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, while countless more will parade collections elsewhere in the city. The New York shows are followed by London, Milan and Paris. But while shoppers are looking to spend their money on so-called \\"wow\\" pieces, Marigay McKee, fashion and beauty director at Harrods, said they were not interested in trends that would only last a season. \\"If it really is a throw away purchase they're not as likely to buy into a momentous trend,\\" she said, adding that this was reflected in what department stores were buying. \\"Certainly buying teams have been a lot more cautious and probably they would be looking at a little bit less frivolity than in previous seasons and probably looking at more staple pieces, must-have garments, must-have trends,\\" she said. The buyers predicted that there would be color on the New York runways, ranging from teal and olive to purple, ruby and yellow, and that some designs could have a military influence. \\"The economy's not great and it's still in the bounce-back stage and you have to give (consumers) a reason to shop,\\" said Ed Burstell, buying director for Liberty of London. \\"I do think a reason to shop means something that they're not going to find everywhere else. It has to have fairly tight distribution or perhaps exclusive distribution,\\" he said. Aside from the fashion, the industry is also raising money for the earthquake victims in Haiti with a special fashion show on Friday and doing its bit for the environment by this year becoming a carbon neutral event. \\"The industry is feeling optimistic. People feel like they are past the worst of it,\\" said Fern Mallis, senior vice president of IMG Fashion, which runs New York Fashion Week. \\"It's been a very healthy restructuring of our industry.\\" (Additional reporting by Basmah Fahim in London, editing by Vicki Allen) Title:","output":"Reviving Retail: Full-Priced Fashions as Fall & Winter Trends Ignite Shoppers Amid Economic Recovery"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the following context:  The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today.

Write a title: Reuters - Nicaragua's unpopularpresident faces possible removal from office after a specialCongressional committee was created on Thursday to explorecorruption charges against him.","output":"Title: \\"Nicaragua's Unpopular President on the Brink of Removal as New Congressional Committee Investigates Corruption Charges\\"  Over the years, political scandals and corruption have been deeply rooted in the modern world. Nicaragua is no exception to this rule, as it currently faces a shake-up in its political landscape. President Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's unpopular head of state, is on the edge of potential removal from office. In recent developments, a special Congressional committee was formed on Thursday with a mission to explore the corruption charges laid against him.  Leading up to this significant event, President Ortega's tenure has been marred with allegations of fraud, nepotism, and misconduct in public office. This has not only created friction with the opposition parties but has also led to mounting dissatisfaction among the masses. As a result, increasing protests and civil unrest have engulfed the country. The decision to establish a special Congressional committee to further investigate these allegations demonstrates a significant advancement in the political crisis surrounding Ortega's administration. This new six-member, bipartisan committee will be responsible for critically examining the charges made against the president and determining if there are valid grounds for his removal from office. The committee's formation has ignited a mixed response from the public. A large section of Nicaraguans sees this development as a crucial step towards restoring democracy and transparency in the government. It is believed that the outcome of this investigation could set a much-needed precedent for addressing political corruption in the country. On the other side of the debate, Ortega's supporters view this move as an attempt to destabilize the government and undermine its authority. Ortega's reign has faced constant challenges since his first term in 2007. His most recent re-election in 2016 sparked controversy as international observers questioned the election's integrity. Moreover, accusations of electoral fraud and intimidation of opposition figures have followed Ortega throughout his political career, further legitimizing the suspicions against him.  As the Congressional committee begins its investigation, it is expected to scrutinize financial transactions, government contracts, and election records to verify the validity of the accusations. Compliance with due process and evidence collection will play a vital role in ensuring a fair and just conclusion. Ultimately, the findings of this committee will determine Ortega's political fate. If the committee concludes that sufficient grounds for impeachment exist, it could recommend drafting articles of impeachment to be deliberated upon in Congress. If the majority of Congress deems impeachment necessary, the process would then ensue, and Ortega could face potential removal from office. Regardless of the outcome, it is apparent that Nicaragua's struggle with political corruption is far from over. The establishment of the special Congressional committee will, however, send a strong message to politicians within the country and around the world, demonstrating that no one is above the law. It is also a testament to the power of democracy and the importance of holding public officials accountable for their actions. In the end, the resolution of this crisis will have significant implications not just for Ortega but also for Nicaragua's future. It is crucial that the committee carries out its investigation with transparency and impartiality, ensuring the public's trust in the process and strengthening the principles of democracy and justice in the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we need to get the 'n' by itself on one side of the equation. For this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -140.

The locals are skeptical about who Nualjan is and why she has chosen to reside in their village. Rumors quickly spread regarding the secrets she might be harboring. Intrigued by the gossip, a young journalist named Sam decides to uncover the truth about Nualjan's past and the reason behind her sudden appearance in the village. Act I: After researching the mansion and its history, Sam finds out that the property had been abandoned for decades due to a dark tragedy that occurred there.

Determined to solve the mystery, Sam befriends Nualjan and tries to find out more about her story. As they spend time together, Nualjan begins to reveal bits and pieces about her past life, but nothing conclusive. She talks about her childhood, growing up in a distant country, and how she had always felt like an outsider. As Sam continues to dig deeper, he starts to unravel the mystery about Nualjan's connection to the mansion. Act II: Sam discovers a hidden room in the mansion that contains a diary belonging to the wealthy family's daughter, Lillian, who lived in the mansion generations ago.

A woman is awaiting her execution while she tells her story to a priest.Luis Vargas (Antonio Banderas), a wealthy Cuban businessman who seeks out an American wife, believes Americans represent the future, and that his own countrymen - and women - are mired in the past and their traditions. After months of corresponding with Julia Russell (Angelina Jolie), the day comes when she sails to his country to be his bride. Julia departs from the ship, looking nothing like the photos she's sent prior to her voyage. Julia explains she wants more than a man who is interested in a pretty face, and that's why she's been deceptive - substituting a plain-looking woman in place of her own picture. Luis also admits to deception; he's been misleading her into believing he's a poor working man, instead of the rich owner of a coffee company.Luis and Julia wed within hours of her setting foot in Cuba. Passion and lust lie just below the surface as the two begin to discover each other over the next few days. Luis falls passionately in love with his new bride and expresses it physically (which is a famous sex scene between the two celebrities). But, while Julia seems to be fighting inner demons, she is holding herself back from too deep an emotional involvement.Meanwhile, Julia's sister Emily has been trying to contact her sister, justifiably worried about her after such a long trip to a strange land. Luis forces Julia to write back, fearing that if Julia continues to ignore Emily's letters, Emily will assume something terrible has befallen her sister and might send the authorities to check on her welfare. Holding off as long as possible, Julia finally pens a letter to her sister, setting into motion the execution of Julia's hidden agenda.In order to assure that his wife has everything she wants, Luis adds Julia to his business and personal bank accounts, giving her free rein to spend as she pleases. Luis discovers Julia has run off with nearly all of his fortune, and... Answer:","output":"What were the motives behind Julia's decision to deceive Luis, and how did the dynamic between them shift throughout the movie as they navigated their secrets, passions, and hidden agendas?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.  - Reull Vallis is a valley on Mars that appears to have been carved by water . It runs westward into Hellas Planitia . It is named after the Gaelic word for planet .  - Astrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some  such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya  developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th-17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.  - The Noachis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Noachis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-27 (Mars Chart-27).  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km).  - Hellas Planitia is a plain located within the huge, roughly circular impact basin Hellas located in the southern hemisphere of the planet Mars. Hellas is the third or fourth largest impact crater and the largest visible impact crater known in the Solar System. The basin floor is about deep, deeper than the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin, and extends about east to west. It is centered at Hellas Planitia is in the Hellas quadrangle and the Noachis quadrangle.  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - A terrestrial planet, telluric planet, or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals. Within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The terms \\"terrestrial planet\\" and \\"telluric planet\\" are derived from Latin words for Earth (\\"Terra\\" and \\"Tellus\\"), as these planets are, in terms of composition, \\"Earth-like\\".  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.  - The Hellas quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Hellas quadrangle is also referred to as MC-28 (Mars Chart-28). The Hellas quadrangle covers the area from 240° to 300° west longitude and 30° to 65° south latitude on the planet Mars. Within the Hellas quadrangle lies the classic features Hellas Planitia and Promethei Terra. Many interesting and mysterious features have been discovered in the Hellas quadrangle, including the giant river valleys Dao Vallis, Niger Vallis, Harmakhis, and Reull Vallisall of which may have contributed water to a lake in the Hellas basin in the distant past. Many places in the Hellas quadrangle show signs of ice in the ground, especially places with glacier-like flow features.  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.

Question: suppose the plant is in a city with lots of people exhaling near it happens, how will it affect LESS cells being damaged.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Since plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) during photosynthesis and humans exhale CO2, the presence of many people near a plant could increase the amount of CO2 that plant can use for photosynthesis. This potentially could enhance the plant's health and vitality and even enhance its ability to potentially counteract various pathogens, including bacteria. However, it is important to note that your question seems to suggest a correlation between plant health and the decrease in damaged human cells from sickness, which is not directly connected. On the supposition that the plant's health is reflected in less harmful bacteria in the environment, it could perhaps indirectly contribute to fewer cells in the human body being attacked and killed by bacteria. But it's also worth mentioning that the majority of bacterial pathogens that affect humans are not the same that affect plants. So the presence of people exhaling near a plant poses a \\"more effect\\" on the plant's health due to increased levels of CO2 for photosynthesis. Nevertheless, it may have \\"no effect\\" or \\"less effect\\" on the occurrence of damaged human cells, as the pathogens that a healthy plant can counteract typically aren't those that cause illnesses in humans. In general, the bacteria that enter the human body and cause damage to cells leading to sickness are far more complexly associated with the overall environment, personal health and immunity, lifestyle factors, etc., which are not directly affected by the health of plants in close proximity to humans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The industrial espionage case involving RM and VW began with the hiring of Jos Ignacio Lopez, an employee of GM subsidiary Adam Opel","output":"No, the next sentence does not follow the preceding text correctly.  The identities of the companies mentioned are inconsistent between the two sentences. In the first sentence, the industrial espionage case involves two auto manufacturing companies, General Motors (GM) and Volkswagen (VW). In the second sentence, however, the company implicated with VW changes from GM to RM without any explanation.  On a related note, please understand who José Ignacio López de Arriortúa is. He is a Spanish engineer and manager who is recognized in the automobile industry for the controversial circumstances in his departure from General Motors (GM) and his subsequent hiring by Volkswagen (VW). Here's a more detailed overview of the story to provide context to this inconsistency. López de Arriortúa was a high-ranking executive at Adam Opel AG, a German subsidiary of General Motors. His strategies for cost reduction and numbers-driven approach to manufacturing logistics earned him a marked reputation within the company. However, Lopez's career at GM took a drastic turn in 1993 when he left under controversial circumstances to join VW as its production director.  Following his departure, GM accused López de Arriortúa and VW of industrial espionage. The allegations were that López had taken with him a significant amount of sensitive corporate information, including internal reports and plans for upcoming car models - information that could ostensibly give VW an unfair competitive advantage in the market. Consequently, GM initiated a lawsuit against López and VW, setting off one of the most notorious cases of industrial espionage in the history of the auto industry. In conclusion, given the preceding text, the correct following sentence should retain GM as the entity involved in the industrial espionage case with VW rather than switching it to RM: \\"The industrial espionage case involving GM and VW began with the hiring of José Ignacio López, an employee of GM subsidiary Adam Opel.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He adds: \\"I found that the Colchians had more recollection of the Egyptians than the Egyptians had of the Colchians.\\" Israel, indeed, would long retain a very lively recollection of the Egyptians! In this passage, the ancient historian Herodotus is referencing the cultural connection between the Colchians and the Egyptians as observed in the practice of circumcision. According to Herodotus, during his time in the fifth century B.C., the Colchians still remembered the Egyptians more so than the Egyptians remembered the Colchians. Herodotus' observation is significant, as it points to the possibility of shared cultural practices and beliefs between these two societies, despite the distance and time that may have separated them. Additionally, Herodotus' mention of Israel in this context suggests that the nation also held strong memories of their encounters with the Egyptians. This could be because, in the ancient world, Egypt was a powerful and influential civilization which left a lasting impression on many other ancient societies. Particularly, the biblical account of the Israelites' enslavement in Egypt and their subsequent exodus led by Moses would remain a significant part of their cultural and historical memory. In conclusion, the passage from Herodotus highlights the long-lasting impact of Egyptian culture on other societies such as the Colchians and Israelites. By mentioning the practice of circumcision among the Colchians, Herodotus demonstrates that cultural exchanges and interactions between different ancient civilizations played a crucial role in shaping their collective memories and identities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The charity shop is a British institution, selling everything from clothes to electric goods, all at very good prices. You can get things you won't find in the shops anymore. The thing I like best about them is that your money is going to a good cause and not into the pockets of profit-driven companies, and you are not damaging the planet, but finding a new home for unwanted goods. The first charity shop was opened in 1947 by Oxfam. The famous charity's appeal to aid postwar Greece had been so successful that it had been flooded with donations. They decided to set up a shop to sell some of these donations to raise money for that appeal. Now there are over 7,000 charity shops in the UK. My favorite charity shop in my hometown is the Red Cross shop, where I always find children's books, all 10 or 20 pence each. Most of the people working in the charity shops are volunteers, although there is often a manager who gets paid. Over 90% of the goods in the charity shops are donated by the public. Every morning you see bags of unwanted items outside the front of shops, although they don't encourage this, rather ask people to bring things in when the shop is open. The shops have very low running costs, and all profits go to charity work. Charity shops raise more than PS110 million a year, funding medical research, overseas aid, supporting sick and poor children, homeless and disabled people, and much more. What better places to spend your money? You get something special for a very good price and a good moral sense. You provide funds to a good cause and step lightly on the environment.

On the left side of the equation, we have two terms with the variable k: 50*k and 7*k. Combine these terms by adding them: 50*k + 7*k = 57*k Now the equation looks like this: 57*k = -5*k - 1054 Step 2: Move all terms with the variable k to one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 5*k to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -5*k term from the right side: 57*k + 5*k = -5*k + 5*k - 1054 62*k = -1054 Step 3: Solve for k by isolating the variable. We need to get k by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll divide both sides by 62: 62*k / 62 = -1054 / 62 k = -17 Thus, the solution to the equation 50*k + 7*k = -5*k - 1054 is k = -17."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to get to school, I had to ride a city bus for the 1st time, without information/assistance! I barely managed to squeeze in and had to stand on the step of the packed bus on the way to school. BTW, smoking was STILL happening on these buses! I noticed every time we went around a corner, it seemed a bell would ring. I falsely assumed it meant HANG ON! So, when it was time to return home, the bus was not as crowded, and I actually was able to sit down. Again, every time we turned the corner, a bell would ring. So I held on tight! As we neared my bus stop to get off, the bus whizzed past it, without stopping! Panic began to set in quickly. I already had a very strange, long day in a new 3 story school building, and I smelled like cigarette smoke! I quickly moved to the empty seat behind the driver, and told him he didn’t stop where I needed to get off. He asked me if I rang the bell. I admitted to him, I had no knowledge of riding on a city bus. He was kind, explained to pull the bell pull 1 block prior to my stop. He explained he would circle back around and I could get off at my stop on the return trip. I was SO relieved! However, now I was 1/2 hour late getting home, especially stressed and tired from the new school and bus fiasco, AND I smelled like cigarette smoke!

Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

What is the answer to this question? when did the we can do it poster come out?","output":"The \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster, featuring the iconic image of a strong female worker commonly known as \\"Rosie the Riveter,\\" was initially created in 1942, during World War II. Artist J. Howard Miller designed the poster for Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company as part of their internal War Production Coordinating Committee's campaign to boost worker morale and encourage women to join the manufacturing workforce. The poster was one of many motivational posters that aimed to galvanize the American public during the war effort. However, the \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster was not widely known at the time it was created. In fact, it was only displayed for a brief period within the company's facilities and was not circulated for public enlistment drives or other formal initiatives. Its primary purpose was to prevent labor disputes and promote unity and hard work among the company's employees. The \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" character gained greater visibility and cultural significance in 1943 when the song \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" was released by Redd Evans and John Jacob Loeb. This song, which celebrated women who worked in manufacturing plants to produce munitions and equipment for the war, helped solidify the image of the female war worker in the public's mind. Simultaneously, Norman Rockwell's illustrated depiction of a female worker titled \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" made the cover of The Saturday Evening Post in May 1943, bringing the concept to an even larger audience. It wasn't until the 1980s, however, that Miller's \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster gained widespread recognition as a symbol of female empowerment. In that decade, the poster was rediscovered and reproduced, and by the 1990s, it had become a popular symbol for feminist movements and campaigns for women's rights. Throughout the years, \\"Rosie the Riveter\\" and the \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster have continued to inspire and empower generations of women, serving as a testament to their resilience, determination, and immense contribution to society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added  hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose   tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze   and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea.  This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.

Donald Trump net worth: I'm worth whatever I feel NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Everyone knows it: Donald Trump is rich. Really rich. Forbes magazine has ranked him among its 400 richest Americans nearly every year since it started keeping track in 1982. And in his own media blitz, Trump -- who is acting like a candidate, even though he hasn't officially become one -- has been boasting about his wealth. But just how much Trump is actually worth remains the subject of debate and even a lawsuit. Last week, Trump told CNN's Candy Crowley that his net worth is \\"many, many, many times Mitt Romney,\\" making him a better-suited contender for president. And on Thursday, he reiterated the claim on CNN's American Morning. \\"Forbes says 2.7 billion. I can tell you that's a very low number. It's much more than that,\\" Trump said, adding if he decides to run, he would provide a financial statement. \\"I think people will be extremely impressed.\\" For its part, Forbes magazine says it relies on a variety of sources, including \\"employees, rivals, attorneys, ex-spouses and securities analysts.\\" It includes all assets, from stakes in companies to art to yachts. But because many of Trump's holdings are private companies, their value is not publicly disclosed. Other properties, such as the Trump Soho in New York City, are not actually owned by Trump; instead, he gets a licensing fee for allowing them to brandish his moniker. In addition, Trump is involved in many complicated deals -- making calculating his wealth tricky. In recent years, he's expanded his empire to include the NBC reality show \\"The Apprentice\\" and its spinoff \\"Celebrity Apprentice.\\" At least one reporter who has challenged Trump's value of his opaque pool of assets has ended up in court. Timothy O'Brien, then a reporter at the New York Times, disputed Trump's net worth in his book, \\"TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,\\" which Warner Books, then owned by CNN's parent company Time Warner, published in 2005. O'Brien put Trump's wealth somewhere between 150 million and 250 million, attributing the figures to people with direct knowledge of Trump's finances. \\"None of these people thought that he was remotely close to being a billionaire,\\" O'Brien wrote in an excerpt published in the Times. Trump sued O'Brien and Warner Books for libel. The case was dismissed but Trump appealed. A decision is pending. CNN has obtained a copy of a deposition of Trump that was conducted on Dec. 19-20, 2007. (Read excerpts from the deposition) In the deposition, Trump insists he's a bona fide billionaire. \\"I am a billionaire,\\" he said. \\"Of course, if you read Tim O'Brien's writings and what was then transposed into the The New York Times, you would certainly not think that. But I am a billionaire, many times over, on a conservative basis.\\" And the book has cost him business, Trump says. \\"I've lost deals. I've lost specific deals because of it,\\" he said. Throughout the deposition, Trump sparred with O'Brien's lawyer, Andrew Ceresney, over how the real estate tycoon determined what he was worth. Trump: My net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with the markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings, but I try. Ceresney: Let me just understand that a little. You said your net worth goes up and down based upon your own feelings? Trump: Yes, even my own feelings, as to where the world is, where the world is going, and that can change rapidly from day to day ... Ceresney: When you publicly state a net worth number, what do you base that number on? Trump: I would say it's my general attitude at the time that the question may be asked. And as I say, it varies. But the deposition shows Trump's valuation of his properties can be at odds with others' views. \\"Donald owns 40 Wall Street, which he spent about 35 million to buy and refurbish in 1996,\\" lawyer Ceresney read from O'Brien's book. \\"The building has about 145 million in debt attached to it, and New York City assessors value it at 90 million. Donald values it at 400 million.\\" Trump reacts to the passage by saying: \\"Anybody would understand that a city assessment is 15 and 20 percent the value of a building.\\" When questioned about the return on his investment from several golf courses, Trump said he does his own math. Ceresney: Have you ever done a projection as to how much you anticipate you will profit on these courses over time in light of the contributions that you're making in cash? Trump: Yes, I've done mental projections. Ceresney: These are projections that you've done in your head? Though Trump acknowledged that he provided O'Brien with financial statements showing his wealth at 3.6 billion, he said the actual figure is closer to 6 billion. \\"These statements ... never included the value of the brand. And there are those who say the brand is very, very valuable,\\" Trump said in the deposition. O'Brien's book tainted his name, The Donald said. \\"My reputation was severely hurt. It was damaged and therefore my brand was damaged,\\" he said. --CNNMoney senior writer Tami Luhby contributed to this article.

That's according to a Twitter post by a parent.      We spoke with the school superintendent in Greenbrier who confirmed that three students participated in the walkout. He says no student came to school asking to participate in the walkout and had made no preparations.      He adds that they were not reprimanded for protesting but for breaking school handbook rules in regards to leaving class.      We're told the students were given the choice of suspension (usually 2 days) or corporal punishment for their participation in the walkout. Corporal punishment is a paddling and must be approved by a parent.      The superintendent said he could not reveal which option the students chose.      Meanwhile in White Hall, school officials released the following information on the discipline that walkout participants face:      The White Hall School District utilized the following disciplinary action found in our Student Handbook on page 42:      Cutting class: Any student who misses part or all of a class or is away from their assigned area for any length of time without permission from school personnel will be considered as cutting class. The following disciplinary action will be taken:      1st Offense – Five (5) days Detention Hall      2nd Offense – Five (5) days In-School Suspension      3rd and Successive Offense: Three (3) day Suspension      On 3/14/18 - The White Hall High School had 10 students and our White Hall Middle School had 3 students to walk out.      Please note NO Student(s) were suspended because of walking out.      And in Bentonville, the District's Director of Communications Leslee Wright released this statement:      \\"About 400 kids from BHS and another 200 from BWHS participated in yesterday's walkout. To my knowledge, detentions have not yet been assigned but was the board's decision. I suspect the logistics of that will be addressed after Spring Break. Spring Break begins Monday.\\" ||||| During the 2011 to 2012 school year, American public school officials in 19 states used corporal punishment 167,000 times.      We don’t know if that is 167,000 kids, or a smaller group of kids that received multiple punishments. What we do know is that at least 167,000 times in one school year, a school official hit a child. This punishment took place even in light of ample evidence suggesting that corporal punishment can increase aggression and hinder learning.      What follows is a primer for parents who want to better understand which states permit corporal punishment, which students are most likely to receive physical punishment, and the surprising heroes attempting to ban corporal punishment in their states.      The states that allow corporal punishment      Most of the debate surrounding corporal punishment focuses on public schools. That’s because all but two states – New Jersey and Iowa – allow corporal punishment in private schools.      The number of states allowing corporal punishment in public schools depends on which report you read. A report by the Society for Research in Child Development claims that 31 states, as well as the District of Colombia, specifically ban corporal punishment in public schools. The U.S. Department of Education put the numbers a bit differently, with only 28 states banning corporal punishment and 22 allowing it.      The discrepancy is explained by the extenuating circumstances allowed for in some state laws. For example, in Maine, corporal punishment was banned in 1975, but according to state law, school officials are permitted to use force against children when a child presents a danger to him or herself, or others. Some researchers count Maine and other states like it as permitting corporal punishment, even though the states themselves reported zero cases of corporal punishment in the nation’s most recent survey of corporal punishment.      A similar discrepancy occurs when counting the states that allow corporal punishment. Some put the number at 15. Others put the number at 19. That’s because some states specifically permit corporal punishment, while others simply have no legislation regarding corporal punishment.      No matter how researchers count, all agree that most of the corporal punishment in the country is concentrated in a handful of states. Just seven states: Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Texas, and Mississippi, account for 80 percent of corporal punishment cases in the U.S. Texas and Mississippi alone count for 35 percent of corporal punishment cases.      Which kids get hit?      Corporal punishment is not evenly distributed across all groups.      A 2009 Human Rights Watch report found that students with disabilities make up 14 percent of the population, but 19 percent of the population of kids subjected to corporal punishment, meaning that they are physically disciplined at a higher rate than their peers.      A report in The Atlantic found that black students, who make up 16 percent of the public school population, accounted for 35 percent of corporal punishment cases, meaning that they were three times more likely to be paddled than their white peers.      The rates of corporal punishment for males are even more disproportional than those for race. Boys are about four times as likely as girls to receive physical discipline. In some districts, that rate is five times as many.      Can parents opt out of corporal punishment for their children?      In some school districts where corporal punishment is still used, parents are given the opportunity to opt out of physical punishment, usually by filing an annual form. In other school districts, parents are notified of a child’s misbehavior and then given the opportunity to approve or disapprove of corporal punishment. In some states, like Missouri, not all districts allow parents to opt out.      Even in states where parents do have the opportunity to opt out, they can feel as though they have no choice to let school officials hit their children. Shana Perez, whose five-year-old was paddled in 2016, highlights the problems of giving parents the ability to “opt out” of paddling by opting into other penalties such as out-of-school suspension.      Perez had already been arrested for truancy after keeping her sick son home from school for too many days, and so believed that she would be arrested if she did not allow him to be paddled for spitting at teachers while running around in the bus line. A choice between your child being hit by the principal and you being put in jail (and thus taken away from your child) is hardly a choice.      Paddling is offered as an impossible “choice”      Paddling is often an impossible choice for students who, much like their parents, also feel that they cannot “opt out.”      Many proponents of corporal punishment will argue that students always have a choice. At Robbinsville High School in North Carolina, principal David Matheson offers students a choice: paddling or in-school suspension. Most students, Matheson asserts, choose the paddling so that they don’t miss school. That choice is often pointed to by educators and legislators as proof that they’re not hurting kids. Kids are choosing their punishment, and many opt for the paddling.      In a debate over a 2017 Arkansas State Senate bill to ban corporal punishment, Senator Alan Clark used his own son as an example, saying that he would have had “fire in [his] eyes” if his son had been suspended for three days instead of paddled. Senator Joyce Elliott, who sponsored the bill, asserted that Clark had been “forced into a false choice” between suspension and paddling.      Legislators like Elliott, as well as researchers across the country, are arguing for a third choice: non-punitive disciplinary methods.      Kids working to change the system      2017 has not been a good year for legislators looking to stop corporal punishment. This year, proposed bans have been defeated in Arkansas, Colorado, and Louisiana.      However, it has been a good year for students looking to corporal punishment for an education…in the legislative system.      In Arizona, high school student Taylor Garman was inspired by the Shana Perez’s viral video. She contacted State Senator Don Shooter about her research, and the two are now working to craft a bill banning corporal punishment.      Alex Young, a student from Louisville, Kentucky, led a group of students to write a bill for the Kentucky Youth Assembly. When his proposed corporal punishment ban passed the assembly, he took it to state representative Jim Wayne, who helped Young revise the bill and introduced it in February 2017. Although the bill was defeated, Young and his fellow students are still busy contacting state Republicans in order to find a co-sponsor who will help them re-introduce the bill in 2018.      You and your kids can read the existing corporal punishment laws for each state and territory here. If you’re unpleasantly surprised about what you find, maybe it’s time to follow in Garman’s and Young’s footsteps and contact your local representatives. ||||| This crawl of online resources of the 115th US Congress was performed on behalf of The United States National Archives & Records |||||","output":"A Twitter post reveals that some Arkansas students have faced disciplinary action using paddling for participating in the National Walkout Day.

Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given process The given process describes the life cycle of a mushroom, from spore germination to the formation of a mature mushroom cap. Step 2: Consider the perturbation In this case, the perturbation hypothesis involves a very hot climate. This external factor could have an effect on the germination of spores, which is an essential step in the mushroom life cycle. Step 3: Assess the potential impact of the perturbation High temperatures may potentially impact the germination process in several ways: - Direct effect: Heat can cause desiccation (drying out) of the spores, reducing their chances of successfully germinating. - Indirect effect 1: The hot climate could also impact the humidity levels, causing the soil or environment to become less suitable for spore germination since mushrooms generally prefer humid environments to grow. - Indirect effect 2: The hot climate could alter the conditions in the mushroom's natural habitat, potentially affecting the availability of nutrients, the composition of symbiotic microbial communities, or competition among different fungi species. Step 4: Determine if the perturbation affects the process After assessing the potential consequences of a very hot climate, it can be concluded that the perturbation does have an effect on the mushroom life cycle, particularly on the germination of spores. As outlined above, this effect could be either direct or indirect, depending on various factors related to the specific mushroom species and the severity of the heat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times. In an encounter with Indians, Susanna learns that her brother, an army officer, has likely been killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Out hunting, Vallian is shot.

Will reducing the friction in a machine make the machine require more or less work?  During the summer Anthony found it was way too hot to be comfortable. He went out to his garage to get an old fan. The fan was spins on a metal bearing but because it is old it was slightly rusted. When he turned the fan on it spun very slow, struggling to move. He then decided to lubricate the bearing that rotates the fan blades and the fan started spinning normally.  Hint: All machines make work easier, but they don’t increase the amount of work that is done. You can never get more work out of a machine than you put into it. In fact, a machine always does less work on an object than the user does on the machine. That’s because a machine must use some of the work put into it to overcome friction. Friction is the force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. All machines involve motion, so they all have friction. How much work is needed to overcome friction in a machine depends on the machine’s efficiency.

Given the question: Given the below context:  The Willamette River ( (listen) wil-AM-it) is a major tributary of the Columbia River, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of the Columbia's flow. The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding.

Premise: \\"A woman cuts a cake while the woman next to her holds out a plate.\\" Hypothesis: \\"the woman is cutting a loaf of bread\\" The premise describes a scene where a woman is cutting a cake, while another woman nearby is holding a plate, presumably in anticipation of receiving a piece of the cake. From this description, it can be inferred that there is some kind of gathering or event happening, where people are enjoying food and socializing. The roles of the two women are clear: one is in charge of cutting the cake, while the other is ready to receive or serve a slice of it. Now, let's examine the hypothesis - it claims that the woman is cutting a loaf of bread. This statement directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. According to the premise, the woman is cutting a cake, not a loaf of bread. Cakes and breads are typically distinct in texture, ingredients, and purpose. While both can be eaten as part of a meal or during a social gathering, cakes are typically sweet, often frosted, and served as dessert, while bread is more savory and serves as a staple in many cultures and cuisines. It is important to note that the hypothesis does not account for the possibility that the woman could be cutting a cake that is bread-like in appearance (for example, a cake resembling a loaf of bread). However, given that no such information is present in the premise, we must work with what we have. Considering the information provided in the premise, we can confidently conclude that the hypothesis is not true. The premise clearly states that the woman is cutting a cake, which directly opposes the claim in the hypothesis that she is cutting a loaf of bread.

Continue the following story. The blades worked a lot better than the razors from the shop because the  Available choices: (a). blades were dull.. (b). razors were dull..","output":"(b). razors were dull. As John glanced down at the professional blades he had recently bought, he couldn't help but marvel at their sharpness and clean, glistening design. Gone were the days of relying on those store-bought razors that were proving to be dull and lackluster. He knew he had made the right decision by investing in a set of higher-quality tools for his grooming. John had always been passionate about maintaining a clean and prim appearance. It was his belief that a man's appearance spoke volumes about his character. The problem he always encountered was that the razors he found at local stores just never seemed to quite cut it. They were dull and lost their edge quickly, often causing nicks and irritation after just a couple of uses. He had heard about these high-quality blades from a well-groomed colleague at work, who told him about the life-changing experience the blades had given him. Intrigued by the thought of a perfect shave, John began his own search for the flawless razors his co-worker boasted about. After much research and browsing, he finally found an online store that specialised in professional grooming equipment. These blades, he quickly discovered, used a durable blend of steel and other premium materials, creating a long-lasting edge that would require less replacing than their low-quality counterparts. Once John received his new blades, he eagerly awaited his first shave with them. When the morning came, he prepped his face with warm water and the rich shaving cream he used. He noticed that the sturdy handle of the professional blade provided better control and made the razor glide smoothly along his skin, lifting each strand of hair effortlessly and slicing through it with a precision he had never experienced before with his old razors. The result was a perfectly smooth shave, absent of any irritation or cuts. John's face felt refreshed, and he couldn't help but admire the close shave in the mirror. It wasn't just the visual results that made him appreciate the new blades either; the sensation of his soft, smooth skin was also an immense pleasure, and he knew his old razors would never have accomplished this feeling. People around John began to notice the difference in his appearance as well. His colleagues at work, including the one who first mentioned the high-quality blades, were impressed by the professional finish provided by the new razor. His partner felt the pleasant difference when they caressed his face and shared in his satisfaction. Even John's friends noticed and sought him out for advice about transitioning to better grooming tools. John discovered that investing in the right tools can significantly impact not only the grooming experience but also the image he portrayed to others. It boosted his self-confidence and pride in his appearance, which translated into enhanced social interactions and professional achievements. Realizing the importance of using professional-grade grooming equipment, John expanded his grooming repertoire. He started purchasing other high-quality items such as a badger hair shaving brush, pre-shave oil, and a sturdy shaving stand to complete his daily grooming rituals. As the months went by, and the professional blades continued to deliver consistent results, John couldn't help but feel grateful for making the switch. He now realized how crucial it was to use the proper tools for the job, and he vowed never to return to the world of subpar, dull razors again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Their survival and effectiveness on the battlefield hinges on the quality and intensity of the training they receive. The strict and intense training by the Drill Sergeants is aimed at both improving their physical capabilities and strategic understanding, and inculcating a mindset of perseverance, precision, teamwork, and quick decision-making, which could mean the difference between life and death during warfare.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If the red blood cells are defective, it can significantly affect the process of oxygen reaching the body. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which is a protein responsible for binding to oxygen and transporting it throughout the body. If the red blood cells are not functioning properly, they might not be able to carry as much oxygen, or the oxygen might not bind to the hemoglobin efficiently. The perturbation of defective red blood cells has both direct and indirect effects on the process. Directly, the amount of oxygen transported by the blood will be reduced, leading to less oxygen being distributed to the various organs and tissues. Indirectly, the body might compensate for the lack of oxygen by increasing the breathing rate or the heart rate in an attempt to deliver more oxygen to the cells. As a result, the body may face hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and it can lead to fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, and eventually cause damage to vital organs like the heart and the brain. This perturbation creates a negative impact on the overall oxygen delivery process within the body, making it important to identify and address any issues related to red blood cell function."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They lie, and do who knows what other questionable practices. I wish that I had checked out the reviews here before going in to Jiffy Lube for an oil change.   A week ago my car battery died, so after having a new one put in, I decided that I would also go get an oil change since I now had the day off from work. Knowing that I couldn't get a same day appointment at a shop that I like, I decided to stop by the local Jiffy Lube.  When I pulled up, they told me that the oil changes start at 41.99, which is a lot more than I am used to paying for an oil change. Luckily I had a 10 off coupon which helped.   So after they tried to upsell me on everything, and they finished up, I was brought out for the summary and to pay. This is where the lies started.   They told me that they filled up my battery fluid. I know they didn't because it was a brand new battery that had literally just been installed about 2 hours ago. I was there for the install and know it was done well.   They said that they had checked my lights, and that they were all good. Actually, one of my break lights has been out for a while. Do they not want me to ask for a replacement?  When they lie about stupid stuff like that, I lose trust in all of their work. But here's the part that really bothers me:  They told me that my brake fluid was really low, and that I need to get my brakes looked at and worked on. I thought that it was possible that I could use some brake fluid, but I had my everything in the brake system replaced less than a year ago, so I know that is working fine. And I hadn't been having any problems with my brakes. I got in my car and left.   After leaving, the brake light on my dashboard constantly lit up, and I could feel a difference in how my car was braking. Funny how that didn't happen even once before they touched my car. Because of that and because I know they lied about other things, I now suspect that they messed with my brake fluid.   Never going back to this shady place.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: Justin Ross Harris was indicted last week on eight counts in the hot-car death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. Harris could face the death penalty if prosecutors decide to seek it and he's convicted of the most serious charge. However, the felony murder charge predicated on second-degree child neglect -- which was the original charge at the probable cause hearing months ago -- still poses the biggest threat to Harris' freedom. That, and, of course, the sexting charges, which will likely be the easiest to prove. But make no mistake: That felony murder charge will be how the prosecution can convict Harris of his son's murder, even if the killing was unintentional, and, in Georgia, if the underlying felony was unintentional. Each of the eight counts plays a key strategic role in maximizing the state's chances of a conviction against Harris. Following is a breakdown of these carefully calculated charges. The brilliance of the strategy is in the details. Murder in Georgia: Most states divide murder into degrees. Georgia does not. In Georgia, there's only one degree of murder, but with very different kinds of killings qualifying as murder. In this case, two types of murder are alleged: 1) an intentional killing called \\"malice\\" murder, and 2) \\"felony murder,\\" an enigmatic unintentional killing, that is still classified as murder because it is the result of an enumerated felony. Even more complicated, in this case, two different subcategories of felony murder are alleged using child neglect crimes as the predicate felony. Any of these convictions carries a minimum life sentence, but only malice murder is eligible for the death penalty. Count 1 -- malice murder: This is the murder with which we are all familiar. It's the kind committed in the Rue Morgue, or by Professor Plum with the candlestick in the billiard room; or any of the \\"Murders She Wrote.\\" Film, literature and even our board games reflect our cultural assumptions about murder -- that it's an evil crime reserved for the most wicked intent. In Georgia, that's called malice murder, which is defined as a killing with \\"malice aforethought,\\" or intent to kill. There are two kinds of malice: express and implied. Express malice is that deliberate, manifested intention to end another's life. The reality is, however, that direct evidence of deliberate intent is a rarity. Defendants don't always volunteer: \\"I shot the sheriff.\\" It's quite the opposite. Nearly all defendants steadfastly maintain their innocence; they're more likely to deny shooting the deputy. That's why the law allows for malice to also be implied from the circumstances, as long as the defendant's behavior demonstrates an \\"abandoned and malignant heart.\\" Whether express or implied, to convict here the prosecution has a heavy burden to prove this mental element. That's why felony murder is a much more appealing and devastating weapon in the charging arsenal. Counts 2 and 3 -- felony murder (which are predicated on counts 4 and 5, respectively): Felony murder is more of a legal fiction than it is traditional \\"murder.\\" It is an unintentional killing, but one that happens during the commission of another crime. The rationale is that if you commit an inherently dangerous felony, you accept the high possibility that a person will die during the act. An example would be that if you were robbing a bank and one of your co-conspirators went crazy and shot a teller and a cop? Well, you'd be charged with felony murder, even though you didn't pull the trigger. You committed a felony, and a death resulted. So, to prove felony murder, the prosecution need not prove intent to kill. It only need prove: 1) commission of the underlying felony and 2) a resulting death. Count 2 is felony murder based upon count 4: intentional child neglect. So, if the defendant acted intending to cause his child cruel and excessive physical pain, and death resulted, he has committed felony \\"murder\\" under count 2. Still the most problematic for this defendant, however, is count 3, which is the original charge from the preliminary/probable cause hearing. This is felony murder predicated on another felony, count 5, second degree child cruelty. But, instead of having to prove the defendant intentionally caused excessive physical pain (first degree), the prosecution here need only prove that he caused pain with criminal negligence (second degree), even if it was unintentional. The traditional felonies eligible for felony murder were intentional crimes: burglary, arson, rape, robbery and kidnapping. To allow felony murder for an accident seems inconsistent, but Georgia courts hold that this crime of criminal negligence can be the predicate crime for felony murder. That's right: In Georgia, you can be convicted of murder -- society's most heinous crime -- for your unintentional negligence. Count 6 -- criminal attempt: As a society, we punish not only completed crimes but also attempts to commit crimes. It makes sense: suppose a bank robber trips and breaks his leg on his way into the bank with his Glock and his President Nixon mask. He is then arrested without even entering the bank to rob it. We all agree that he cannot escape punishment simply because he's unsuccessful at robbing banks. At the same time, if the would-be robber simply fills up his gas on the way to buy a Glock and a Nixon mask, so he can rob a bank in the future, has he \\"attempted\\" a robbery yet? Where's the line? To the courts, as long as whatever the defendant does is a \\"substantial step,\\" then he's guilty of attempt. Here, the attempt is connected not to the death of his child but rather to the alleged sexual exploitation of another minor -- the target of the text messaging. Counts 7 and 8 -- dissemination of harmful material to minors: To many, these charges seem like they are tacked on, but they are anything but. In fact, they are devastating to the defendant tactically. Here's why:. Harris is now additionally charged with knowingly disseminating and furnishing to a minor female sexually explicit printed matter and photographs -- or, as the detective testified at the preliminary hearing: sexting. The Cobb County detective testified that while Cooper was in the car, Harris sent a photo of his erect penis to an underage girl and was sexting with several women. At that hearing, the defendant had a strong argument that the sexting was improper character evidence (generally not admissible to prove criminality), and more, that evidence that Harris was a creep was not admissible on the neglect or murder charges. But watch what happens now that he's been indicted on these charges: evidence supporting the sexting charges is now relevant. That evidence will at a minimum cause a jury to dislike Harris. At worst, it will be viewed as motive to be rid of his child. Second, of all the charges, these are arguably the easiest to prove, thanks to technology. Did phone 1 send something to phone 2? Was that something considered \\"harmful material\\"? Was a recipient a minor? Most of those elements can be established with phone records and a birth certificate. As for the \\"harmful material,\\" so far, if the allegations are true, it sounds like it could fit. Ultimately, this is hardly a scatter-shot indictment. Each charge plays a vital role, but the most potentially damaging is still the same charge from the preliminary hearing: the felony murder based upon the second-degree criminal neglect. After all, whether you condemn this defendant or sympathize with him, there is a preliminary consensus that at minimum he did something tragically and massively careless. And under modern law, that is apparently what we call \\"murder.\\" Highlights:","output":"A man named Justin Ross Harris is in big trouble because he has been charged with 8 serious things he did wrong that led to the death of his little son, Cooper, who was only 22 months old. One of those charges is called \\"malice murder,\\" which means Justin intentionally killed his son. If he is found guilty in court for this charge, he could face the death penalty.  Another charge is called \\"felony murder,\\" which means someone died because of another bad thing Justin did, but he didn't mean to kill them. It's still called murder in Georgia, where this happened. This charge is dangerous for Justin even if he didn't mean to hurt his son because he made a very bad mistake which led to Cooper's death. There are more charges, like showing inappropriate pictures and messages to young girls, but the most important ones are those related to his son's death. If the court finds Justin guilty of these charges, he could get life in prison or even face the death penalty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes.

Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease.

Q: What is Catalan being supplanted by in Alicante?  A: There are also well ingrained diglossic attitudes against Catalan in the Valencian Community, Ibiza, and to a lesser extent, in the rest of the Balearic islands.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: In Alicante, Catalan, which is referred to as Valencian in the Valencian Community, is being supplanted primarily by Spanish (Castilian). This shift is occurring for a variety of reasons, including: 1. Historical factors: After the War of Spanish Succession in the early 18th century and the subsequent enactment of the Nueva Planta Decrees, Castilian was imposed over the Kingdom of Valencia, which included Alicante. This led to a gradual decline of Catalan (Valencian) in favor of Spanish, as Spanish became the language of the administration, education, and high culture. 2. Migration: During the mid-20th century, as Spain experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization, there was a significant movement of people from the Spanish-speaking regions of the country to the Valencian Community, including Alicante. As the number of Spanish-speaking inhabitants in the area increased, the dominance of Spanish over Catalan grew. 3. Language policy: In the past, Spanish governments, particularly during the Franco era (1939-1975), enforced strict language policies favoring Spanish over regional languages such as Catalan. Although the situation improved after the Franco era, the legacy of these policies still contributes to the weakening of Catalan in comparison to Spanish. 4. Education: In recent years, the Valencian government has tried to promote the use of Catalan in schools; however, the success of these efforts has been limited. As a result, many people in Alicante, especially among younger generations, do not speak Catalan or only have a passive knowledge of it. 5. Economic factors: Career opportunities and economic prospects may be better for Spanish speakers, as Spanish is a more widely spoken language and allows for greater mobility within Spain and internationally. This further encourages parents and students in Alicante to focus on learning Spanish over Catalan. These factors contribute to the decline of Catalan (Valencian) in favor of Spanish in the area. Additionally, diglossic attitudes against Catalan persist in the Valencian Community, such as Ibiza, but to a lesser extent in the rest of the Balearic Islands. This contributes to the reduced use and prominence of Catalan in comparison to Spanish in these regions."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Meet friends The first day of school can be a combination of excitement and nervousness for many students, as they enter a new environment with new teachers, classmates, and potential friends. Among the various activities that a person might want to do on the first day of school, meeting friends is the most suitable option. Here's a more detailed explanation of the other options: A. Cross street: Although crossing the street might be necessary for a student to reach their school, it is not a priority or primary activity associated with the first day of school experience. B. Say words: While communication is essential in school, specifying that a person merely wants to \\"say words\\" is too vague and does not properly address the context of the first day of school or the corresponding emotions that come with it. C. Die of cancer: This option is completely unrelated to the question and is an inappropriate response. It does not address the context of the first day of school or the experiences associated with it. E. Learn: Education is, of course, an important part of the school experience, and learning new things is the primary goal of attending school. However, on the first day of school, many students may not immediately delve into the learning process. They are more focused on adjusting to the new environment and getting to know their classmates and friends. Therefore, among the given options, \\"meet friends\\" is the most suitable option, as it closely relates to the emotional and social aspects of starting a new school year.

One thing: it's the longest of the series that I've seen at 105 minutes. I've only seen six of them but this was longer than I'm used to and with the drawn-out action finale I thought the whole thing was a bit too long. Nonetheless, it is a good mixture of action, suspense and romance. The only things missing are color and stereo sound. The primitive special-effects don't bother me, as that was all that they had back in the 1930s. Among some, this film is most noted for one thing: skin! \\"Jane\\" never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the Hays' Code was instituted by the time the next Tarzan film was made. Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan possessed. The nude underwater scene, however, was not her - by a longshot.

Harris has no qualms with the nail salon, but she hopes her actions inspire others to treat people with disabilities the way they would want to be treated themselves.      “We’re not trying to bash the nail salon. We’re not trying to make them lose customers, make them look bad,” she said. “But maybe spread awareness that no matter the person, who they are, what color they are, disability, whatever, they’re people too.

Here is a news article: Iran has arrested a number of people over videos that were posted on Instagram, including a young woman who filmed herself dancing to music.      According to activists, Maedeh Hojabri was one of a number of users behind popular Instagram accounts who have been arrested. The identities of the other detainees have not been confirmed.      Her account, which has been suspended, was reported to have had more than 600,000 followers.      Hojabri has since appeared on a state television programme with other detainees, in which she and others made what activists say were forced confessions, a tactic often used by Iranian authorities.      State TV showed a young woman, her face blurred, crying and shaking while describing her motivation for producing the videos.      “It wasn’t for attracting attention,” she said. “I had some followers and these videos were for them. I did not have any intention to encourage others doing the same … I didn’t work with a team, I received no training. I only do gymnastics.”      Little is known about Hojabri’s personal life, or which city in Iran she is from, but since her arrest her videos have been shared by hundreds of people, giving her a reach beyond her account.      They appear to have often been taken using a camera in her bedroom while she danced to western pop and rap music without wearing a hijab, which is required in public.

She used to record dance videos in her bedroom and upload them to her instagram with 600K followers.#مائده_هژبرى pic.twitter.com/3EDVR9veV3 — Negar (@NegarMortazavi) July 8, 2018      Iranian Instagram celebrity and dancer Maedeh Hojabri would have been just another teenager in most parts of the world: operating multiple social media accounts and uploading videos of herself dancing.      But Hojabri's videos are suddenly at the center of the latest conflict between religious hard-liners and Iranian liberals seeking more liberties.      Officials arrested the 17- or 18-year-old Hojabri after she shared with her tens of thousands of followers videos of herself dancing to Western and Iranian music at home. The tussle over social codes is nothing new in Iran. It has played out in many ways for decades: Iranian musicians tapping into Western influences, for example, or Iranian women challenging authorities by pushing back their headscarves to almost gravity-defying styles.      The Internet age, however, has added a new dimension of dissent. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has often described websites as something akin to a Trojan horse of Western culture and values.      Iranian media outlets reported that authorities were looking into banning more Instagram accounts or shutting down access to the site completely. Other individuals besides Hojabri also appear to have been detained on similar charges. Their identities are still unknown, and all of them were reportedly released on bail.      In response to the arrest, some women took to social media in support of Hojabri to post videos of themselves dancing, using the Iranian version of the hashtag #dancing_isnt_a_crime. (Women in Iran are prohibited from dancing in front of men, except if those male observers are close family members.)      “I'm dancing so that they [the authorities] see and know that they cannot take away our happiness and hope by arresting teenagers and [girls like] Maedeh,” the BBC translated the tweet of one supporter.      Hojabri and others facing similar accusations previously appeared on Iranian state TV in a video in which the young gymnast — potentially speaking under duress — acknowledged producing the videos.      “I had some followers, and these videos were for them. I did not have any intention to encourage others doing the same.... I didn’t work with a team; I received no training. I only do gymnastics,” the Guardian newspaper quoted her as saying in the clip of the broadcast on Iranian state TV.      Hojabri's arrest bears similarities to a 2014 incident in which six young Iranians were arrested for producing a video based on the Pharrell Williams song “Happy.” The video quickly went viral but also provoked the dismay of conservative Iranian authorities.      After their arrest, Iranian state television showed the detainees admitting that they were involved in the “Happy” production, even though they insisted that they had been tricked into participating. As in Hojabri's case, Iranian TV did not show the faces of the individuals making the confessions. Their sentence — one year in prison and 91 lashes — was later suspended.      The arrests at the time highlighted the divides in the country's leadership. Even though President Hassan Rouhani has repeatedly indicated that he may favor opening up Iran's restrictive official Internet, enforcing laws online is ultimately up to the judiciary, which is controlled by religious hard-liners.      With an increasing number of protests taking place across Iran amid economic woes, conservatives have adopted a more repressive approach in recent months. And while authorities sometimes turn a blind eye on some violations of the country's strict laws on female clothing or Western music, Iran still regularly punishes violations to set examples.      Last year, for instance, four men and two women were detained for teaching the Colombian fitness routine Zumba and “Western” dances.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only \\"curiosities\\"? from the following article ?  On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820.  Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including Chalk Cliffs on Rügen—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \\"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\\"Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings \\"please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind.\\"Friedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of Georg Friedrich Kersting, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl (1788–1857).

In a message sent to an AU summit in the Rwandan capital of Kigali on Sunday, King Mohammed VI said it was time for Morocco to retake its place.      \\"For a long time our friends have been asking us to return to them so that Morocco can take up its natural place within its institutional family,\\" he said in a speech to African leaders as they began a two-day meeting.      \\"The moment has now come.\\"      According to MAP, the official Moroccan news agency, the monarch said that although his country had left the organisation, \\"it never quit Africa.\\"      READ MORE: UN chief regrets Western Sahara 'occupation' comment      Morocco considers Western Sahara an important part of the kingdom.

In his message, King Mohammed urged the AU to reconsider its stance on what he called the \\"phantom state\\", saying that a political solution was being worked on under the supervision of the UN.      Western Sahara is not a member of either the UN or the Arab League, he said, adding that \\"at least 34 countries do not recognise it.      \\"On the Sahara issue, institutional Africa can no longer bear the burden of a historical error and a cumbersome legacy,\\" the King said.      \\"Through this historic act and return, Morocco wants to work within the AU to transcend divisions.\\"      Morocco's return to the AU would need to be validated by a vote. |||||Summary:","output":"Morocco has formally announced its desire to rejoin the African Union (AU), 32 years after originally leaving the organisation.

Given the question: Information:  - Chronology (from Latin \\"chronologia\\", from Ancient Greek , \\"chrónos\\", \\"time\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time. Consider, for example, the use of a timeline or sequence of events. It is also \\"the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events\\".  - Diffuse reflection is the reflection of light from a surface such that an incident ray is reflected at many angles rather than at just one angle as in the case of specular reflection. An illuminated \\"ideal\\" diffuse reflecting surface will have equal luminance from all directions which lie in the half-space adjacent to the surface (Lambertian reflectance).  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color.  - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.  - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz).  - The hexagonal snowflake , a crystalline formation of ice , has intrigued people throughout history . This is a chronology of interest and research into snowflakes . Artists , philosophers , and scientists have wondered at their shape , recorded them by hand or in photographs , and attempted to recreate hexagonal snowflakes .  - A spectrum (plural \\"spectra\\" or \\"spectrums\\") is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary, without steps, across a continuum. The word was first used scientifically in optics to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light after passing through a prism. As scientific understanding of light advanced, it came to apply to the entire electromagnetic spectrum.  - A snowflake is either a single ice crystal or an aggregation of ice crystals which falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.   - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - A timeline is a way of displaying a list of events in chronological order, sometimes described as a project artifact. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates alongside itself and usually events  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.    'timeline of snowflake research' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?

An annuity premium is the amount paid by an individual, either as a one-time lump sum or a series of payments, to an insurance company or financial institution to purchase an annuity contract. A typical annuity premium can vary based on factors such as the type of annuity (fixed, variable, or indexed), the specific terms of the contract (such as the length of the payout period and other guaranteed benefits), and the individual's age, health, and financial goals. Fixed annuities typically have more straightforward and predictable premiums, often requiring the purchaser to pay a predetermined amount upfront or in installments. In contrast, variable and indexed annuities may involve a greater degree of variability in their payment amounts and schedules, influenced by the performance of underlying investments and market conditions.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   3.4 | The Cell Membrane By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Understand the fluid mosaic model of membranes • Describe the functions of phospholipids, proteins, and carbohydrates in membranes A cell’s plasma membrane defines the boundary of the cell and determines the nature of its contact with the environment. Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled quantities. Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux. The plasma membrane must be sufficiently flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a plasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital as tissues and organs form during early development, and which later plays a role in the “self” versus “non-self” distinction of the immune response. The plasma membrane also carries receptors, which are attachment sites for specific substances that interact with the cell. Each receptor is structured to bind with a specific substance. For example, surface receptors of the membrane create changes in the interior, such as changes in enzymes of metabolic pathways. These metabolic pathways might be vital for providing the cell with energy, making specific substances for the cell, or breaking down cellular waste or toxins for disposal. Receptors on the plasma membrane’s exterior surface interact with hormones or neurotransmitters, and allow their messages to be transmitted into the cell. Some recognition sites are used by viruses as attachment points. Although they are highly specific, pathogens like viruses may evolve to exploit receptors to gain entry to a cell by mimicking the specific substance that the receptor is meant to bind. This specificity helps to explain why human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or any of the...   Q: What encloses the border of animal cells?

While returning to the car I realized I had locked my keys and my phone inside! I had about 15 minutes to get back to the school which was a good 4- or 5- minute drive away. I considered rushing back, but it being winter, I thought a fall on ice would only make the situation much worse. So I ran into a McDonald's and asked the man at the counter   who happened to be the manager to please call me a taxi. I explained my situation to him, and I could tell by the look in his eyes, that he took pity. He hurried to the back to use the phone while I walked in the restaurant. I had less than 10 minutes to get back to my school at this point. The manager returned only to tell me that the taxi company had put him on hold and then the line got disconnected, and that he was now on hold again, but had not yet been able to ask for the taxi yet.

Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests.  Which forest would see higher rates of chemical weathering, forest A or forest B?  Hint: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Forest A (the tropical forest in Brazil) would experience higher rates of chemical weathering compared to Forest B (the temperate forest in Germany). The reasons for this higher rate of chemical weathering in Forest A are: 1. Elevated temperatures: Tropical forests have higher temperatures, which accelerate chemical reactions, leading to a faster rate of chemical weathering. 2. Greater insolation: Tropical forests receive more solar radiation compared to temperate forests, which, in combination with higher temperatures, leads to increased biological activity and chemical weathering processes. 3. Higher rainfall: Tropical forests receive heavier rainfall, which promotes higher rates of chemical weathering. The increased water availability enables the dissolution and transport of various elements and minerals, facilitating weathering. 4. Enhanced biomass productivity: Tropical forests, with their highly productive biomass generating up to 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year, result in higher rates of decomposition. This ultimately contributes to greater chemical weathering rates. 5. Lower podzolization: Unlike temperate forests, tropical forests experience little to no podzolization (the process of soil layer differentiation). They do not display significant visual or chemical contrasts within soil layers, resulting in different weathering patterns. 6. Precipitation of mobile metals: Tropical forest soils often have a rusty red color due to the precipitation of mobile metals such as magnesium, iron, and aluminum as oxide minerals. The movement and deposition of these metals in tropical forests lead to increased chemical weathering rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For example: [732, 994, -527, 702, 490, 738, -157, 562, -410, -944, -443] 2. Your goal is to round each integer in the list to the nearest tens place, which means you will round each number to the nearest multiple of 10. Guidelines and steps to find the answer: 1. Understand the concept of rounding to the nearest tens place (nearest multiple of 10). For example, 732 will round down to 730 (the nearest multiple of 10) and 738 will round up to 740 (the nearest multiple of 10). 2. For each integer in the list, follow the rounding rule: if the ones digit is 5 or greater, round up to the next nearest multiple of 10. If the ones digit is less than 5, round down to the nearest multiple of 10. 3. Apply this rule to each integer in the list, one by one. 4. Create a new list with the rounded integers.  5. The resulting list is your answer. Let's apply these steps to the given input: Input: [732, 994, -527, 702, 490, 738, -157, 562, -410, -944, -443] 1.

Q:For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

The Rams would tie the game with QB Marc Bulger completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt.  In the second quarter, St. Louis would take the lead with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 42-yard field goal for the only score of the period.

In the fourth quarter, Carolina took over for the remainder of the game as kicker John Kasay nailed a 34-yard field goal, Delhomme and Carter hooked up with each other again on a 9-yard TD pass, and Kasay finished the game with 32-yard field goal. The game was notable when offensive tackle Orlando Pace suffered a season-ending injury. This severely hurt the Rams' offense. Which player had the highest average yards of field goals?","output":"To determine the player with the highest average yards of field goals, we need to consider the kickers mentioned in the text: Jeff Wilkins and John Kasay.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: This is a tense time for students in America,with the exam season in full swing and the stress and anxiety being felt across the country.At some universities,students are reviewing their lessons,knowing that in a few weeks the stress will be over once they put pen to paper in that exam hall.For others,however,that stress and anxiety may well last a while longer as lecturers continue to refuse to set exams.No one knows when things will get back to normal. The reason behind this trouble is the ongoing argument in higher education between lecturers and employers over pay.The Association of University Teachers(AUT)are currently taking industrial action because of the fact that lecturers have been underpaid for years.Vice-presidents of the universities,who enjoy six-figure salaries,are not making any noises to suggest that this will change in the near future. The National Union of Students(NUS) ly believes that our lecturers should be better paid,and that the promises made to them during the top-up fees debate about extra income must be kept. It's shameful that 1ecturers have had to take industrial action to achieve better pay and conditions while vice-presidents'own salaries have risen 25%over the past three years.But the students who are suffering as a result of the argument must be put first.We do not agree with the attitude taken by the AUT,which is refusing to set exams.We admit that the decision to take this course of action was democratically reached.However,it is having the biggest effect on our members at this moment in time and we will continue to let the AUT know the results of this. We call on both sides to sort this mess out.Hopefully then our members can get the horrible exam season Out of the way and start planning,and enjoying,their upcoming summer holiday. Question: The author wrote this article on behalf of  _  . Options: A: the vice-presidents B: the lecturers C: the students D: the AUT Answer:","output":"The author wrote this article on behalf of the students. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. From the sentences such as \\"this is a tense time for students... stress and anxiety being felt across the country\\", it seems like the article is talking about the issues from a student's perspective. 2. Multiple references are made to how students are suffering due to the conflict between lecturers and employers over pay conditions, such as \\"students who are suffering as a result of the argument must be put first\\". This again aligns with a student-oriented perspective. 3. The used language speaks to the hardships and impact that the current situation is having on students, reinforcing the idea that it is written on their behalf. 4. The closing sentence ends with a hope for students to be able to enjoy their upcoming summer holiday, indicating a concern for the students' well-being, therefore the author of the article represents the students. The other options don't fit as well:  - The article is not written on behalf of the vice-presidents as the author is critical of their high salaries while lecturers are underpaid.    - The author does acknowledge the lecturers' right for better pay, but also criticises the AUT's decision to refuse to set exams, indicating the article is not written on behalf of the lecturers, or the AUT.  So, the answer is C: the students."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

No The sentence given does not provide a valid answer to the question, \\"What other name is used when referring to the origins of the Presbyterian Church?\\" The sentence discusses the reasons for some splits within the Presbyterian Church, focusing on doctrinal controversies and disagreements related to the Westminster Confession of Faith. However, the sentence does not mention an alternative name for the origins of the Presbyterian Church. To address the original question, the origins of the Presbyterian Church can be traced back to the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, particularly to the teachings of John Calvin and the subsequent influence of John Knox in Scotland. The term \\"Presbyterian\\" comes from the Greek word \\"presbuteros,\\" which means \\"elder\\" or \\"mature Christian leader,\\" referring to the church's governance structure that relies on a system of elected elders. While there is no specific alternative name referring to the origins of the Presbyterian Church, the theological roots of Presbyterianism are often associated with Calvinism or the Reformed tradition, as John Calvin played a significant role in shaping Presbyterian beliefs and practices. Thus, the appropriate answer to the question would be that there is no alternative name for the origins of the Presbyterian Church itself, but its theology and roots are often associated with Calvinism and the broader Reformed tradition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This House would legalise the use of cell phones in cars What argument could one make about this debate topic?","output":"Argument: The ease of communication, access to emergency services, and utilization of hands-free technology can improve safety and convenience for drivers. Step 1: Identify the debate topic The debate topic is about whether or not to legalize the use of cell phones in cars, meaning that people would be allowed to use their cell phones while driving. Step 2: Consider the potential benefits of using cell phones in cars To create a strong argument, we need to consider the benefits of using cell phones while driving, including increased communication, improved safety, and greater convenience for drivers. Step 3: Develop a main point One possible argument is that legalizing the use of cell phones in cars would improve safety and convenience for drivers. This claim can be supported by the following sub-points: a) Hands-free technology allows for safe use of cell phones in cars - With advancements in hands-free and voice-activated technology, drivers can now use their cell phones without taking their hands off the wheel or their eyes off the road. Legalizing the use of cell phones in cars would encourage the adoption of these safer technologies, reducing the risk associated with manual phone operation while driving. b) Access to emergency services - In case of an emergency, drivers need to be able to contact emergency services as quickly as possible. Legalizing the use of cell phones in cars ensures drivers can call for help in a timely manner, potentially saving lives in the process. c) Enhanced communication - Legalizing cell phone use in cars can improve communication with family, friends, and work. If drivers need to make important calls or receive crucial information, they can do so securely with hands-free technology. This enables them to stay connected and potentially prevent accidents caused by hurried driving to reach a destination for a call or information exchange. Step 4: Address potential counterarguments Opponents may argue that cell phone use in cars can lead to distracted driving and increase accident rates. However, by focusing on promoting hands-free technology and educating drivers about responsible phone use, the risks can be significantly reduced. Step 5: Conclude the argument In conclusion, legalizing the use of cell phones in cars can improve safety and convenience for drivers by promoting the adoption of hands-free technology, ensuring timely access to emergency services, and enhancing communication. By addressing potential concerns and promoting responsible cell phone use, the benefits of this measure outweigh potential risks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Albert is a scientist who travels the planet looking for new species to discover and analyze. While on a safari in Australia, Albert discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods. In the first species, species A, the adult individuals had high body mass on average. In the second species, species B, the adult individuals had low body mass on average.  Which species will have longer lifespans?  Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided and Aristotle's inference rules, we can deduce the following: 1. Brood size decreases with adult body mass. 2. Lifespan increases with gestation period and body mass. 3. Fecundity decreases with lifespan. Now, let's apply these rules to the two species Albert discovered: Species A has a higher body mass as compared to species B. According to Rule 2, a higher body mass correlates with a longer lifespan. Therefore, it is likely that species A will have a longer lifespan than species B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return. Thus, the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that was abroad for much of the intervening period of Nuffield? ?  Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine.  Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana.  Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end... Answer:","output":"Austen Harrison."},{"instruction":"Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the full names of the two individuals who conceived of a college for students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding?, using the article: Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a  visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales., what would be the answer ?

In response, Maria was incredibly supportive, showing empathy and understanding towards Katrina's situation. Maria knew that building self-confidence is a gradual process, and she endeavored to help her friend by providing a safe and comfortable environment for her to express her concerns and work on developing her communication skills with the opposite gender. Initially, Maria suggested that Katrina practice having casual conversations with male acquaintances, classmates, or coworkers to help familiarize herself with talking to boys in a non-threatening environment, where there is less pressure to impress or be judged. Maria encouraged Katrina to seek out diverse conversations to explore different topics of interest, allowing both Katrina and the people she engaged with to feel more at ease while conversing. Next, Maria advised Katrina to focus on her body language and non-verbal cues, as those can significantly impact how she is perceived by others. By maintaining eye contact, standing up straight, and positioning her body in an open and approachable manner, Katrina could project a more self-assured image to others, and in turn, feel more confident in herself.

Those in his close-knit circle described him as having a sparkling personality, with his kindness being a quality that stood out among others. His ambitions had brought him far, from Sri Lanka to the United Kingdom, where he had hoped to start afresh.  Unfortunately, on a fateful day which was meant to serve as a turning point in his lifting career, Peiris was dealt a wicked hand. He was due to clock off his existing job and had already started saying his goodbyes. In an unfortunate twist of fate, he was persuaded to take one final delivery, a decision that sadly led to his tragic end. When Peiris did not report back from his final delivery, concerns arose. He was later found in his car, victim to a horrendous crime; he had been fatally stabbed. The shocking revelation of Peiris's dreadful experience befell a court recently where gruesome details were shared. At the helm of this heinous act is a man named Shamraze Khan, who is now facing a murder charge. The exact role or motive of Khan in the fatal stabbing of Peiris is yet to be fully understood. However, this alleged act of violence has shaken both local and international communities, leading to pressing queries about the safety of foreign workers in the region. Alongside Khan, another individual, Kasim Ahmed, has been implicated in the crime. Contrarily though, Ahmed has pleaded guilty, possibly indicating remorse for his involvement in the act. Though details of his plea and the extent of his involvement are being kept under wraps due to the ongoing trial, it raises further questions about this tragedy.  The untimely death of Thavisha Lakindu Peiris is not just the loss of a promising individual to his family and friends, but also to the IT industry, where he could have made substantial contributions. This profoundly regrettable incident reminds us of the dark side of humanity, the violence that looms over unsuspecting victims, and the importance of standing against such senseless crimes. As the case continues to unfold, the hope remains that justice will be served for Thavisha Lakindu Peiris, and his death will not be in vain. It is paramount that the message is clear: no ambition, no dream, no life should be cut short due to such ruthless acts of violence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The sultry and sexy actress was electric in the 1940s films 'To Have and Have Not' and 'Key Largo' opposite her husband, Humphrey Bogart      Lauren Bacall, the willowy actress whose husky voice, sultry beauty and all-too-short May-December romance with Humphrey Bogart made her an everlasting icon of Hollywood, has died, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. She was 89.      Bacall died Tuesday morning of a stroke in her longtime home in the Dakota, the famous Upper West Side building that overlooks Central Park in Manhattan.      Bogart and Bacall were one of the most popular Hollywood couples, onscreen and off, and their 11-year marriage was the stuff of romantic lore. In 1981, their love provided the lyrics for Bertie Higgins' 1981 pop hit “Key Largo\\" — “We had it all, just like Bogie and Bacall.\\"      They met just before they filmed her first movie, To Have and Have Not (1944), directed by Howard Hawks, her mentor. Although only 19, Bacall and her smoldering cool were the perfect match for the 44-year-old Bogart and his tough guy-persona.      Her best-remembered films, many of them considered classics, were with Bogart: To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep (1946), Dark Passage (1947) and Key Largo (1948).      Bacall received her only Oscar nomination for her supporting role as Barbra Streisand's mother in The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996). She was the recipient of an honorary Academy Award in 2010 “in recognition of her central place in the Golden Age of motion pictures,\\" but that moment did not lead to pleasant memories — she said she always regretted failing to mention her children Sam, Stephen and Leslie in her acceptance speech.      Bacall also enjoyed a splendid stage career. She captured two Tony Awards for best actress in a musical: in 1970 for Applause, the adaptation of All About Eve, in which she played Margo Channing, the role created by her idol Bette Davis; and in 1981 for Woman of the Year in a part originated by Katharine Hepburn, a good friend whom she once called “the female counterpart to Bogie.\\"      Bacall also received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for Career Achievement from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in 1992.      Bacall penned two memoirs, By Myself (1978), which won a National Book Award in 1980, and Now (1994), in which she mused about getting older and living alone.      She admitted that being a “legend\\" and “special lady of film\\" unnerved her because “in my slightly paranoiac head, legends and special ladies don't work, it's over for them; they just go around being legends and special ladies.\\"      She was born Betty Jean Perske in the Bronx on Sept. 16, 1924, the only child of Jewish immigrants. Her father left the family when she was 6, and her mother struggled to make ends meet. She attracted attention as a teenage model while studying acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York.      Crowned Miss Greenwich Village in 1942, Bacall made her stage debut in George S. Kaufman's Franklin Street in Washington, then appeared in March 1943 on the cover of Harper's Bazaar.      That cover photo was noticed by Hawks' wife, Nancy, who showed it to the celebrated director, and he called Bacall in for a screen test. Based on the test, Hawks told her she would star in something with either Bogart or Cary Grant.      “I thought Cary Grant, great. Humphrey Bogart‚ yuck,\\" she later said. Nonetheless, Hawks had her meet with Bogart and could not help but notice their immediate chemistry, casting her as the femme fatale Marie in To Have and Have Not, an adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway novel. (Bogart's character, Steve, nicknamed her “Slim,\\" which Hawks also called his wife.)      In By Myself, she described meeting Bogart for the first time, on the set of Passage to Marseille (1944).      “Howard told me to stay put, he'd be right back — which he was, with Bogart,\\" she wrote. “He introduced us. There was no clap of thunder, no lightning bolt, just a simple 'how do you do.' Bogart was slighter than I imagined‚ 5 foot 10 and a half, wearing his costume of no-shape trousers, cotton shirt and scarf around his neck. Nothing of import was said‚ we didn't stay long‚ but he seemed a friendly man.\\"      But soon, Bacall and Bogart — who at the time was married to his third wife, actress Mayo Methot — began an affair during the filming of To Have and Have Not.      One particular scene in the film stands out: As Bacall stood fetchingly just inside Bogart's hotel room door, readying to leave, she noticed his tongue-tied interest in her: “You don't have to say anything, Steve, just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? … You just put your lips together and blow.\\" She closed the door, leaving Bogart's character awestruck.      The two married in 1945 on a farm in Lucas, Ohio, owned by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Louis Bromfield, a friend of Bogart, and regularly hosted parties at their Holmby Hills mansion.      “I fairly often have thought how lucky I was,\\" she told Vanity Fair in a 2011 interview. “I knew everybody because I was married to Bogie, and that 25-year difference was the most fantastic thing for me to have in my life.\\"      Bacall later admitted her so-called cool was just a way of concealing her jangled, first-movie insecurity. “I used to tremble from nerves so badly that the only way I could hold my head steady was to lower my chin practically to my chest and look up at Bogie,\\" she said.      That was the beginning of what admirers called “The Look.\\"      Her legendary low, sexy voice, however, hampered a scene in To Have and Have Not where she was supposed to sing. It has always been a point of speculation whether it was Andy Williams, then a teenager, who dubbed in the singing voice for Bacall's rendition of Hoagy Carmichael's “How Little We Know.\\"      Her distinctive throaty voice did make her a natural for commercials, and later in her career, Bacall voiced numerous spots, including plugs for PBS.      Following To Have and Have Not, her next film was opposite Charles Boyer in Graham Greene's Confidential Agent (1945) in which she played an English girl. Bacall considered the experience horrible. “It was the worst movie, a nightmare, and I was terrible in it,\\" she said. “And as quickly as I had been placed on a pedestal, I fell off.\\"      But she was cast opposite Bogart again in Hawks' classic The Big Sleep, a steamy adaptation of a Raymond Chandler novel in which Bogart plays the classic private eye Philip Marlowe while Bacall sizzled as the lithesome daughter of Bogart's rich, sinister employer.      Bacall followed with two more starring roles opposite Bogart, Dark Passage and Key Largo, John Huston's classic noir film.      She followed in 1950 in a film without Bogart titled Bright Leaf and did her first comedy, How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), starring with Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable. Perhaps her most memorable film from the 1950s was Douglas Sirk's melodrama Written on the Wind (1956) with Rock Hudson. The following year, Bogart died of esophageal cancer, leaving her with their children, Stephen and Leslie. Bacall was 32 at the time.      Following Bogart's death, Bacall dated Frank Sinatra and was set to marry him. But days after she accepted his proposal in 1958, The Los Angeles Herald reported on the impending nuptial on page 1 and Sinatra broke things off, refusing to speak to her for two decades. “Frank did me a great favor. He saved me from the complete disaster our marriage would have been,\\" she told People magazine in 1979. “But the truth is that he behaved like a complete shit.\\"      She starred in Designing Women (1957) opposite Gregory Peck, The Gift of Love (1958) with Robert Stack and British drama North West Frontier (1959) with Kenneth More before moving back to New York and appearing in a number of Broadway plays.      In 1961 she married Oscar-winning actor Jason Robards, a relationship that lasted until 1969. Their son, actor Sam Robards, survives them. She summed up that relationship in the People interview:      “When I invited a few friends over to celebrate [Robards'] 40th birthday, Jason showed up at 2 a.m., loaded. I grabbed a bottle of vodka, smashed it into the cake and yelled, ‘Here's your goddamn cake!' The marriage ended when I came across a letter written to him by his girlfriend.\\"      Bacall did not make another film until Shock Treatment (1964), a murder mystery set in a mental institution. She followed that up with a light comedy, Sex and the Single Girl (1964), which also starred Henry Fonda, Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood.      Bacall had a supporting role in the noir private eye thriller Harper (1966) with Paul Newman, played in the star-studded ensemble Murder on the Orient Express (1974), based on the Agatha Christie play, and co-starred with John Wayne in his final film, The Shootist (1976).      In 1981, she starred in The Fan, a riveting story about an actress being stalked by an obsessed fan (Michael Biehn), but spent the major part of the decade back on Broadway, winning the Tony in 1981 for Woman of the Year. She also starred on Broadway in Cactus Flower and Goodbye Charlie while venturing to London and Australia for Sweet Bird of Youth.      Film historians ascribe her relative lack of movie credits during this period as one of the unfortunate results of the demise of the studio system, an enterprise that for all its faults turned out strong female stars. Admitting that scripts were not “exactly piling up at my door,\\" she nevertheless returned to the screen with Mr. North (1988) and then Rob Reiner's Misery (1990), the Stephen King adaptation starring Kathy Bates.      Later, she performed in several made-for-TV movies, in Robert Altman's farce Pret-a-Porter (1994) and with Jack Lemmon and James Garner in the comedy romp My Fellow Americans (1996).      Altman talked about her longevity in a 1997 interview. “She never got locked in any time warp,\\" he said. “Think about how many social and attitudinal changes that have occurred, and yet Bacall has always remained unique.\\"      Most recently, Bacall appeared in the French film Le Jour et la Nuit (1997); in Diamonds with Kirk Douglas and in Presence of Mind with Harvey Keitel, both released in 1999; in the TV miniseries Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke (1998) as the billionaire tobacco heiress; in Dogville (2003) with Nicole Kidman; and in The Forger (2012).      In a 2006 episode of The Sopranos, Bacall played herself getting accosted by a mugger who tried to swipe her swag bag as she left an awards show.

And who wouldn’t want her to, for the pleasure of hearing her firing off smart, unvarnished remarks about old Hollywood in that husky voice? But the end came at last on Tuesday, when the 89-year-old actress died from a stroke at her home, according to a report on TMZ. The Humphrey Bogart Estate followed with this tweet: “With deep sorrow, yet with great gratitude for her amazing life, we confirm the passing of Lauren Bacall.”      Whether she was trading double entendres with Humphrey Bogart, hawking freeze-dried instant coffee in a TV commercial, or taking a punch as a guest star on The Sopranos, Bacall had no equal at projecting an insolent, imperious, sexy, and slightly impish personality. (Okay, maybe Kathleen Turner came close for a while.) Was Bacall a great, rangy actress? No, but she was a lanky, electrifying presence, and a champion movie and stage star.      In her tough, tart 1979 autobiography Lauren Bacall By Myself (updated in 2005 with 80 fresh pages and the expanded title By Myself and Then Some), Bacall lays out the improbable story of her near-instant ascension in Hollywood at age 19. Spotted on a 1943 fashion-magazine cover by the wife of director Howard Hawks, she landed opposite Humphrey Bogart in 1944’s To Have and Have Not, the first of their four films together. Hawks taught her how to speak in a low, provocative voice and nixed her birth name, Betty Joan. The stars sparked off screen as well as on. “Baby” and “Bogie,” as they called each other, wed in 1945, when she was 20 and he was 45.      She lost Bogie to cancer in 1957, leaving her to raise their son Stephen and daughter Leslie alone, and in the 1960s she had a stormy marriage with heavy drinker Jason Robards Jr. (with whom she had another son, Sam Robards). In the toughest initial post-Bogie years, Bacall moved back East—she’d grown up in New York—to alternate movies with stage roles. She won Tonys for 1970’s Applause and 1981’s Woman of the Year and picked up her lone Oscar nomination for Barbra Streisand’s 1996 middle-aged romance The Mirror Has Two Faces. Bacall’s stage work is spottily archived, but her strongest movies, along with entertaining interviews, are easily found—and eternally pleasurable.      So go dig up the DVDs and do the YouTube searches and say a benediction for Betty Bacall. We’ll miss her leonine jaw, her cool appraising gaze, and her royal growl of a voice. —Steve Daly       ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Lauren Bacall, the actress known for her sultry beauty and iconic Hollywood films, passed away at the age of 89.

For most people, it is a picture of a person wearing unusual clothes with a hat on his head, dancing to the music in a cool way. For example, a person who wears a large T-shirt dances on the street. Clearly, clothes those street dancers wear show their personalities   and clothing styles. Now let us take a look at street dancers' clothing styles. Tops If you look into the clothing styles of street dancers, you will notice that there is a large difference between the tops that men and women wear. For men, they often wear a large T-shirt with probably a jacket at times. However, for women, they often wear tank tops (T) . Bottoms Today, the street dancers still prefer wearing large jeans and a lot of men also wear Capri pants  . However, women start to wear mini skirts or shorts. Nowadays knee-high socks are also a popular new look for the women. Footwear For any street dancer, shoes are important. Any pair of shoes that produces the slightest sound can destroy  the performance. So they need a pair of shoes that allows them to move freely. In fact, street dancers' clothing has to be something that allows for a lot of comfort   and that shows personalities. The two points are important for any street dancer. Without those things, it is difficult for street dancers to perform well and show their personalities. What do you think about the clothing style of street dancers? Maybe you like it or maybe you don't. Anyway, people have different ideas of beauty. According to this passage the street dancers' shoes should be   _  .

From November 17, 1947 to December 23, 1947, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT&T's Bell Labs in the United States performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium, a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input. Solid State Physics Group leader William Shockley saw the potential in this, and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors. The term transistor was coined by John R. Pierce as a contraction of the term transresistance. According to Lillian Hoddeson and Vicki Daitch, authors of a biography of John Bardeen, Shockley had proposed that Bell Labs' first patent for a transistor should be based on the field-effect and that he be named as the inventor. Having unearthed Lilienfeld’s patents that went into obscurity years earlier, lawyers at Bell Labs advised against Shockley's proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a \\"grid\\" was not new. Instead, what Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley invented in 1947 was the first point-contact transistor. In acknowledgement of this accomplishment, Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect.\\" Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Why was the term transistor used?","output":"The term \\"transistor\\" was used because it was coined by John R. Pierce as a contraction of the term \\"transresistance.\\" The name was created to represent the key function of this new device, which was its ability to transfer an electrical signal while also providing a variable level of electrical resistance. This combination of properties made the transistor a powerful, versatile component in electronic devices, allowing for amplification and precise control of electrical signals. The term transistor conveniently and effectively captured the essence of the new invention, making it an appropriate name to use."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work.

She has no idea that her husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), a car salesman, is having an affair with his secretary and that he intends to leave Betty to pursue a relationship with her. She also doesn't know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs out of the car dealership. When Betty calls to leave a message about borrowing a Buick LeSabre for her birthday, her husband tells her to take a different car, as the LeSabre (unknown to Betty) has stolen drugs hidden in the trunk. Two hitmen, Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), show up at the house with Betty's husband. The hitmen torture Betty's husband into revealing that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of a car, but Wesley scalps him anyway. Betty witnesses the murder and experiences a fugue state, escaping the reality of murder into the comforting fantasy of the soap opera. In her mind, she assumes the identity of one of the characters in the daytime drama, a nurse.

The fan was spins on a metal bearing but because it is old it was slightly rusted. When he turned the fan on it spun very slow, struggling to move. He then decided to lubricate the bearing that rotates the fan blades and the fan started spinning normally.  Will reducing the friction in a machine make the machine require more or less work? A:","output":"Reducing the friction in a machine will generally make the machine require less work. In Anthony's case, when he lubricated the bearing that rotates the fan blades, he decreased the friction between the moving parts, allowing for smoother and more efficient movement. This friction reduction results in several benefits, such as decreased energy consumption to perform the same task, less heat generation, increased lifespan of the machine, and improved overall efficiency. Friction is a force that is present when two surfaces are in contact, and it creates resistance to motion. The energy required to overcome friction is converted into heat, meaning that a portion of the input energy is wasted in the form of heat. In a machine with high friction, a significant amount of energy is consumed in overcoming the resistance, leading to a reduced efficiency. By reducing the friction between moving parts, the machine can achieve the same amount of work with less effort and input energy. Lubrication, as Anthony employed in his fan, is a common technique utilized to decrease friction in machines. Lubricants, such as oil or grease, form a thin film between contacting surfaces, keeping them separate and minimizing direct contact. This, in turn, reduces the friction and associated energy losses. In summary, reducing friction in a machine results in less work being required to achieve the same output. It enhances the machine's efficiency, reduces energy consumption, and can increase its lifespan. In Anthony's case, lubricating the rusted bearing allowed the fan to spin more freely and require less work than when it was struggling to move due to the friction from the rusted surfaces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no;","output":"A). Yes, the hypothesis \\"The Licchavi dynasty ruled for about four hundred years.\\" is true based on the given premise. The premise states that the Licchavi dynasty, originating from high-caste Hindu society, ruled over the Kathmandu Valley from approximately A.D. 330 to A.D. 700. In order to determine the accuracy of the hypothesis, it is essential to examine the timeframe given in the premise. The Licchavi dynasty commenced its rule in the Kathmandu Valley around A.D. 330 and continued to govern the region until about A.D. 700. To calculate the duration of their rule, subtract the starting year (A.D. 330) from the ending year (A.D. 700): A.D. 700 - A.D. 330 = A.D. 370 As a result, the Licchavi dynasty governed the Kathmandu Valley for approximately 370 years. The hypothesis claims that their rule lasted for \\"about four hundred years.\\" While the exact duration is 370 years, it can still be reasonably approximated to 400 years, considering the historical context and the possibility of slight inaccuracies in the dating. This is especially relevant since dating and timelines during ancient times can often be uncertain or imprecise due to the scarcity of historical records and other challenges in the field of historiography. Therefore, based on the provided premise, the hypothesis \\"The Licchavi dynasty ruled for about four hundred years.\\" can be considered true, as the rounded up duration of their rule aligns closely with the given range of years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From the calculations in Step 1, the 250-pack is the most cost-effective at 0.0838 per hot dog. Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of 250-packs one can buy. - Budget: 300 - Price per 250-pack: 20.95 - Maximum 250-packs: 300 / 20.95 ≈ 14.32 (rounding down to 14, since we cannot buy a fraction of a pack) Step 4: Calculate the total cost of purchasing 14 x 250-packs. - Cost: 14 x 20.95 = 293.30 Step 5: Calculate the remaining budget. - Remaining Budget: 300 - 293.30 = 6.70 Step 6: Use the remaining budget to buy additional hot dogs. Since we have 6.70 left, we can buy: - either 4 x 8-packs (1.55 * 4 = 6.20) or - 2 x 20-packs (3.05 * 2 = 6.10) Let's compare which of these choices allows us to buy more hot dogs: - 4 x 8-packs: 4 * 8 = 32 hot dogs - 2 x 20-packs: 2 * 20 = 40 hot dogs Step 7: Calculate the greatest number of hot dogs that can be bought using the most cost-effective pack and the remaining budget. - Maximum 250-packs: 14 packs * 250 hot dogs = 3500 hot dogs - Additional hot dogs: 40 hot dogs (using the 20-packs) - Total hot dogs: 3500 + 40 = 3540 hot dogs Thus, the greatest number of hot dogs one can buy at this store with 300 is 3540."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...when was life liberty and the pursuit of happiness written??","output":"The phrase \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" was written in the United States Declaration of Independence, which was adopted on July 4, 1776. The idea behind this phrase is that certain \\"unalienable rights\\" or basic human rights, should be accessible to all individuals, and these rights cannot be taken away or denied by any government or authority.  Thomas Jefferson, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence. As a political philosopher and a prominent thinker, Jefferson was deeply influenced by the European Enlightenment and key philosophers such as John Locke, who wrote about \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of property.\\" In 1776, Jefferson was appointed to a committee to draft a declaration explaining the reasons for the American colonies' break from Britain. Among the five members of the committee, which also included Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, Jefferson was chosen to write the first draft. Jefferson rephrased Locke's philosophy and modified it to \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\" He intended to highlight the importance of individual freedom by emphasizing people’s right to pursue their own goals and aspirations. By replacing \\"property\\" with \\"the pursuit of happiness,\\" he made a conscious effort to shift the focus towards the well-being and self-fulfillment of individuals. The adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, marks the official beginning of the United States as an independent nation. The phrase \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" has since become a fundamental part of American political culture and remains a guiding principle for the nation's laws and policies. In summary, \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" was written as part of the United States Declaration of Independence in July 1776, authored by Thomas Jefferson who was influenced by European Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke. The phrase emphasizes the importance of individual freedom in the pursuit of personal well-being, and it continues to serve as a cornerstone in American political thought and legislation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Saboteurs blew up an oil pipeline in southern Iraq early today in the latest attack targeting the countrys crucial oil industry, police and oil officials said.","output":"This incident is about an act of sabotage carried out on an oil pipeline in southern Iraq. Saboteurs, or individuals intent on causing destruction, orchestrated the explosion with the specific aim of damaging the country's crucial oil industry. This attack is significant for several reasons, as detailed below. Firstly, Iraq is a major player in the global oil market and has one of the world's largest proven oil reserves. The country's economy relies heavily on oil revenues, which account for about 90 percent of its budget. As a result, any disruption to its oil infrastructure impacts not only the Iraqi economy but also the global oil market. Secondly, this incident highlights the ongoing security challenges and instability in Iraq. The country has faced a surge in violence in recent years, including frequent attacks on oil pipelines and other critical infrastructure. This situation affects investor confidence, foreign direct investment, and the country's efforts to attract international oil companies for the development of its oil resources. The motives behind these acts of sabotage can vary, but they often stem from political, economic, or sectarian tensions in the country. Some common reasons for targeting oil infrastructure include: 1. Financial gain: By disrupting Iraq's oil production and exports, saboteurs can manipulate oil prices and exploit potential shortages for monetary benefit. 2. Political motives: Various insurgent groups or factions within Iraq may attack oil installations and infrastructure to undermine the legitimacy of the government and sow discord among its citizens. 3. Sectarian conflict: Iraq has a diverse population consisting of different ethnic and religious groups, namely Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds. Tensions between these groups have been a longstanding issue, and attacks on oil infrastructure can serve as a means of expressing discontent or inciting violence. Moreover, the perpetrators of such attacks could be one of several groups, including: - Domestic insurgent groups: The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Al-Qaeda have both targeted Iraq's oil infrastructure in the past. Although ISIS's territorial control has diminished considerably, its remnants continue to carry out attacks in an effort to regroup and destabilize the country further. - Regional actors: Neighboring countries with vested interests in Iraq's oil resources or political stability may be involved in covert sabotage operations to influence Iraq's policies. - Disgruntled factions or individuals: Disputes over land and resource ownership, profit-sharing, or political representation among tribes, local communities, and religious groups may trigger attacks on oil infrastructure to draw attention to their grievances and demands. The Iraqi government and security forces continue to face immense challenges in safeguarding the country's oil infrastructure and ensuring uninterrupted production and exports. These efforts often require collaboration with international partners, investment in advanced technology, training of security personnel, and robust intelligence-gathering capabilities. In conclusion, this incident of sabotage on an oil pipeline in southern Iraq is reflective of the broader issues of security, economic dependency, and political and sectarian conflict within the country. Such attacks have severe consequences for both Iraq's domestic stability and the global oil market, underscoring the interconnected nature of these challenges."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power.  and a hint : In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  Please answer this question : Which country used more coal? The answer to this question is:","output":"Turkey used more coal in this situation.  As mentioned, Turkey relied mostly on fossil fuels for electricity production, whereas Greece utilized nuclear power. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, which are commonly used for generating electricity. Since coal is a type of fossil fuel, and Turkey predominantly used fossil fuels for their energy production, it can be concluded that Turkey had a higher consumption of coal for electricity generation than Greece, which focused on nuclear power.  It's worth noting that both fossil fuels, such as coal, and nuclear power have their respective pros and cons in terms of environmental impact, sustainability, and availability of resources. The burning of coal and other fossil fuels contributes to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming; moreover, they are nonrenewable resources that will eventually run out. On the other hand, while nuclear power does not produce air pollution or contribute to the environmental issues associated with burning fossil fuels, it does involve radioactive elements, which are also nonrenewable and could be used up in time. In summary, among the two competing countries, Turkey consumed more coal for electricity production due to its reliance on fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power as its primary energy source. Both energy sources have their inherent challenges and implications, yet they are critical for meeting the electricity demands of modern societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose body temperature rises less happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If the body temperature rises less, it will have the following effects on the steps involved in body cooling: 1. Body temperature rises (less) - This means that there is a smaller increase in body temperature compared to the normal scenario. This may cause reduced body heating. 2. The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - Since the body temperature rise is less, the brain may not need to respond as strongly, resulting in less dilation of blood vessels. 3. The sweat glands become active - Again, with a smaller increase in body temperature, the activation of sweat glands may be reduced, leading to less sweat production. 4. Moisture is released from the pores - Less active sweat glands could mean less moisture being released from the pores. 5. The moisture evaporates - With less moisture released, there is a smaller amount of moisture to evaporate, resulting in less evaporation overall. 6. The evaporation causes cooling - Less evaporation implies a reduced cooling effect. In conclusion, since the initial perturbation is a smaller increase in body temperature, it leads to a lesser degree of cooling taking place in each subsequent step.

Difficult life in the spotlight: Whitney Houston faced an extortion plot shortly after her marriage to Bobby Brown, and a constant stream of obsessive fan mail. Whitney Houston's troubled private life was laid bare yesterday when the FBI revealed it kept a 128 page-file on her - including obsessive fan letters and details of an extortion attempt. Shortly after Houston married singer Bobby Brown, a 'close friend' who was 'privy to. much personal information' allegedly attempted to blackmail her. A. Chicago lawyer wrote to her production company threatening that unless the singer paid 100,000 (£66,000), his client. planned to 'reveal details of [Houston's] private life to. several publications'. Later the blackmail amount was upped still. higher to 250,000 (£165,000). Whitney's father apparently sent the perpetrator a confidentiality. agreement and an unknown sum of money. The FBI monitored her at the height. of her fame between 1988 and 1999 and the files show a decade of dealing with intrusive fans. In 1999 she began receiving letters. and cassette tapes from the Netherlands which she found. threatening. The. FBI interviewed the man, who made outlandish claims that he was the 'President of Europe', purchased Brazil for 66billion and helped. Nelson Mandela win election in South Africa. At the very beginning: Whitney Houston as young up-and-coming singer signing a recording deal with Clive Davis of Arista Records in 1983. At the height of her fame: Whitney Houston in 1988 when the FBI began monitoring her. Among her fan letters sent by a man from Vermont, New England wrote that he 'might hurt someone with some crazy idea.' He proclaimed his love for the late singer through more than 70 letters in a 17-month period, sent to Houston at the height of her fame. More... Whitney Houston 'visited doctors three times in the eight days before her death' Whitney Houston was 'chronic cocaine user' and drowned after suffering massive heart attack, coroner reveals. The file shows the FBI interviewed the man but the bureau concluded no law was broken because the man said that all he wanted was to proclaim his love for her publicly. After the peak of her career, her behaviour was increasingly erratic. She suffered a long battle with drugs, including cocaine, as well as alcohol and spent various spells in rehab. Hell-raising lifestyle: The FBI revealed that Whitney Houston was blackmailed by a 'close friend' after her marriage to Bobby Brown (right) in 1992. Career highlight: In 1992 Whitney Houston scored a blockbuster hit with The Bodyguard, for which she also sang her most famous song 'I will always love you' Recent appearances had become increasingly erratic and the years of substance abuse had clearly taken a toll. She cancelled a string of concerts and talk shows as she struggled to cope. In a chat show with Oprah in 2003,. the star admitted the scale of her addiction to smoking crack cocaine. 'It was every day, every,' she said. 'I didn't think about the singing. part of it any more.' Her powerful voice began to suffer. because of her demons prompting record sales to nosedive and in 2007 she. split from husband Bobby Brown after 15 years of marriage. Houston was found dead in 11 February last year in a Beverly Hills hotel bath. She was 48. Authorities said. her death was an accidental drowning due to cocaine use and heart disease. With her only child: Whitney Houston had one daughter, Bobbi Kristina, with husband Bobby Brown. Shortly before she died: Houston was seen looking worse for wear leaving a nightclub in Hollywood days before her death in February 2012. Paramedics battled to revive the singer but she was pronounced dead hours before she had been due to perform at a pre-Grammys party. Even Houston's funeral was not. without drama. While her daughter with Bobby Brown, Bobbi Kristina, 19,. was in the front row of the church with Houston's mother both in black,. ex-husband Bobby Brown stormed out. Brown had argued with Houston's family over the number of guests he was allowed to bring. Brown was driven away from the funeral but. later returned in time for the start of the home going service. Her mentor, who first gave Houston a. record deal, Clive Davis told the congregation, 'You wait a life time. for that kind of voice to come along'. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article talks about the challenges famous singer Whitney Houston had in her life. The FBI kept a big file about her with 128 pages.

Later, they wanted even more money - 250,000. Whitney also got a lot of letters from fans. Some of these letters were not very nice and made her feel scared. One person sent her more than 70 letters in 17 months saying how much they loved her and they might hurt someone. Whitney had problems with drugs and alcohol, and it affected her singing. This made her record sales go down, and she went to rehab to try to get better. She and her husband Bobby Brown separated after 15 years.

Pick your answer from: *World *Sports *Business *Science/Tech","output":"The topic revolves around 'Business'. The details include elements of business operation, including the acquisition of a company (Marktplaats.nl) by another business entity (eBay). E-commerce companies and acquisitions fall under the category of business activities.  E-commerce is a significant aspect of the business world. It covers all kinds of transactions conducted through the internet, ranging from retail operations to banking. This sector has increased dramatically in recent years due to the rise in internet accessibility and changing consumer behavior. eBay making a strategic acquisition of Marktplaats.nl is an instance of business practice in the e-commerce industry.  In this case, eBay, which is an American multinational e-commerce corporation, purchased a Dutch classifieds platform, enhancing its penetration into the classifieds, a vital segment of internet commerce. eBay's foray into the classifieds space via Marktplaats.nl acquisition marks an aggressive strategy to diversify its business operations, expanding its business services and market reach. This type of strategic, corporate maneuvering is characteristic of business practices in global sectors.  Moreover, the mention of the acquisition value (290 million) adds an element of financial transactions, which is also part of the business landscape. Therefore, this topic is not related to 'World' as it doesn't reflect global affairs in a broad sense or geopolitical events. It is not about 'Sports', as it doesn't deal with any sports-related events, teams, athletes, or competitions. It's also not about 'Science/Tech', while it involves technology (e-commerce), the main focus is on the business transaction (acquisition), not the technology per se. To sum up, eBay's acquisition of Marktplaats.nl is a business topic focusing on e-commerce operations, business strategy, and corporate acquisition in the online marketplace landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter. Answer:","output":"The ecological region that is not on the outermost base of the Table Rocks is the mounded prairie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vic read more about reptile reproduction, while Fox read more about fish reproduction.  Which student learned more about male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water? The answer is:","output":"Fox learned more about male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water. The reason for this is because Fox focused their studies on fish reproduction, which directly relates to the specific topic of male fish releasing their gametes into the water, whereas Vic focused on reptile reproduction. In the context of fish, the releasing of gametes into the surrounding water is part of the reproductive process, which is known as external fertilization. This process is found in many fish species, primarily those that live in aquatic environments such as oceans, rivers, and lakes. External fertilization refers to the process where the male fish, upon finding a suitable mate, will release their sperm – known as milt – into the water, simultaneously or shortly after the female fish releases her eggs. This external release of gametes allows the sperm and eggs to meet and fertilize in the surrounding water. Due to the method of fertilization and the large number of gametes released, there is a relatively high chance of survival for at least some offspring. Fish reproduction can be quite diverse and even differ between species. Some fish, like sharks and rays, practice internal fertilization, in which the male transfers sperm directly to the female's reproductive system through specialized organs called claspers. However, many fish species rely on external fertilization methods, like the one Fox was studying. On the other hand, reptile reproduction is primarily characterized by internal fertilization and oviparity, or egg-laying. Most reptiles, such as snakes, lizards, and turtles, have males that possess hemipenes or a single penis-like organ, which is used to transfer sperm directly to the female's reproductive system. There are also some reptiles that exhibit live birth (viviparity) or egg retention inside the mother's body until hatching (ovoviviparity). However, these cases are the exception rather than the norm. The process of male reptiles releasing gametes into the surrounding water, as seen in some fish species, is almost entirely absent in reptile reproduction. In conclusion, Fox, who studied fish reproduction, would have learned more about male fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water, compared to Vic, who focused on reptile reproduction. This is because fish reproduction encompasses external fertilization, which directly relates to the release of gametes into the water, while reptile reproduction primarily involves internal fertilization and does not involve releasing gametes in the same manner."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Information:  - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.  - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva.  - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9).  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space.  - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world.  - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System.  - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus.   - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain.  - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus.  - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth .  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, .  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.  - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers.  Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground.

Summarize this article: See the wikiHow article How to Knead Clay","output":"The wikiHow article \\"How to Knead Clay\\" is a comprehensive guide on the process of kneading clay properly, which is an essential skill for anyone working with this versatile material. Kneading helps to remove air bubbles, distribute moisture evenly, and create a consistent texture in the clay, ensuring better results when sculpting or pottery making. The article breaks down the process into easy-to-follow steps, accompanied by helpful images and tips. Here's a detailed summary of the article: 1. Determine the type of clay you are working with: Different types of clay require different techniques for kneading, as some may be harder or softer than others. Familiarize yourself with your clay's properties, including its flexibility, consistency, and texture, to know the proper way to knead it. 2. Prepare your work surface: Lay down a waterproof cover, such as plastic sheeting or wax paper, to protect your work area. Make sure you have a clean, non-stick, and waterproof surface for kneading, as clay tends to be messy. 3. Prepare your tools: Gather any tools you may need, such as scrapers or cutting wires, and keep them nearby. It is also a good idea to have a dish of water and a towel handy for dampening your hands, as wet hands make kneading easier. 4. Cut or tear the clay: Cut the clay into manageable pieces to make it easier to work with. Tearing the clay exposes more surface area, which helps in the kneading process. 5. Begin kneading the clay: Hold the clay in both hands and use your fingers, palms, and heels of your hands to press and fold it. Apply even pressure throughout the clay while continuously folding and pressing. Repeat this process for about five to ten minutes, until the clay is smooth, pliable, and free of air bubbles. 6. Observe the clay's texture: As you knead, pay attention to the clay's consistency. The ideal texture is smooth, pliable, and slightly tacky. If the clay is too dry, add a small amount of water to your hands and continue kneading. If it is too sticky, use a scraper to remove excess clay from your hands and work surface, and continue kneading. 7. Monitor your clay's temperature: Kneading will generate heat, causing the clay to become more pliable. Be aware of this change in temperature, as it can help you determine when the clay is properly kneaded. 8. Perform the \\"squeeze test\\": Once the clay is smooth and pliable, perform a squeeze test to ensure there are no remaining air bubbles. Gently press the clay between your thumb and forefinger, creating a thin sheet. If there are no visible air bubbles, the clay is ready to use. 9. Store the clay properly: When not in use, store the kneaded clay in a plastic bag or airtight container to prevent it from drying out. 10. Clean your workspace and tools: After kneading, be sure to clean your workspace and tools thoroughly. Use a scraper to remove excess clay from your work surface, and rinse your tools in water. Make sure everything is dry before storing it away. By following these detailed steps, you can ensure that your clay has the proper consistency and texture, making it easier to work with, regardless of your project. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced clay artist, using the kneading techniques listed in the article can greatly improve the outcome of your projects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: \\"For golf enthusiasts, two courses reassure the visitor you are close to civilization.\\" From this sentence, we understand that there are two golf courses available for golf enthusiasts and these two courses indicate that the visitor is close to civilization. 2. Sentence 2: \\"There are two golf courses available.\\" This sentence states directly that there are two golf courses available. Now, let's consider the meaning of 'entailment' in linguistics. An inference is 'entailed' by a sentence if the truth of that sentence guarantees the truth of the inference. If Sentence 1 is true, is Sentence 2 also guaranteed to be true? Reflecting on our breakdown, both sentences definitely confirm the availability of two golf courses. However, Sentence 1 provides additional information about location and audience (golf enthusiasts). While this additional information doesn't contradict or undermine the content of Sentence 2, Sentence 2 does not include it - it simply states that two golf courses are available, without specifying for whom or indicating anything about their location. Therefore, Sentence 2 is indeed entailed by Sentence 1.

Pick your answer from: +no. +yes.","output":"+no. While the two questions you presented appear to be similar, they do not have the exact same meaning. To better understand the difference between the two questions, let's break them down. 1. \\"Will you fully pardon Edward Snowden?\\" This question is directed to the person being asked, as if they have the authority to pardon Edward Snowden. It is asking whether the person plans to issue a full pardon to Snowden. In this case, the question would probably be addressed to someone who has the power to grant one, like the president. Essentially, it's asking for the person's intent to take action on this matter. 2. \\"Should the US government pardon Edward Snowden?\\" In contrast, this question is not asking about the intent of the person being asked. Rather, it is asking for their opinion on what the US government should do with regard to Snowden. The focus of the question is on the principle or moral stance of pardoning Snowden, rather than the possible intent or action of the person being asked. In summary, while both questions concern the idea of pardoning Edward Snowden, they do not have the same meaning. The first question focuses on the intent and actions of the person being asked, whereas the second question asks for their opinion on what the US government should do."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is at 29% to 15% for Ben Carson, 9% for Jeb Bush, 8% for Carly Fiorina, 7% for Marco Rubio, 6% each for Ted Cruz and John Kasich, and 5% each for Mike Huckabee and Scott Walker. That group makes a pretty clear top 9. Rounding out the field are Chris Christie and Rick Santorum at 2%, Jim Gilmore, Rand Paul, and Rick Perry at 1%, and Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal, and George Pataki at less than 1%.      Our new poll finds that Trump is benefiting from a GOP electorate that thinks Barack Obama is a Muslim and was born in another country, and that immigrant children should be deported. 66% of Trump's supporters believe that Obama is a Muslim to just 12% that grant he's a Christian. 61% think Obama was not born in the United States to only 21% who accept that he was. And 63% want to amend the Constitution to eliminate birthright citizenship, to only 20% who want to keep things the way they are.      Trump's beliefs represent the consensus among the GOP electorate. 51% overall want to eliminate birthright citizenship. 54% think President Obama is a Muslim. And only 29% grant that President Obama was born in the United States. That's less than the 40% who think Canadian born Ted Cruz was born in the United States.      Trump's supporters aren't alone in those attitudes though. Only among supporters of John Kasich (58/13), Jeb Bush (56/18), Chris Christie (59/33), and Marco Rubio (42/30) are there more people who think President Obama was born in the United States than that he wasn't. And when you look at whose supporters are more inclined to think that the President is a Christian than a Muslim the list shrinks to just Christie (55/29), Kasich (41/22), and Bush (29/22). Bush's inability to appeal to the kind of people who hold these beliefs is what's keeping him from succeeding in the race- his overall favorability is 39/42, and with voters identifying themselves as 'very conservative' it's all the way down at 33/48.      Trump is winning his fight with Megyn Kelly. When we last polled her in December of 2013 her favorability with Republicans nationally was 44/9. Her favorability is in a similar place now at 42% but her negatives have shot up to 20%, largely because she's at 20/43 with Trump's supporters. Meanwhile Trump's popularity with GOP voters has just continued to grow. Last month before the debate his favorability with them was 48/39, now it's improved to 56/30. Fox News as a whole isn't suffering for the feud though- in February we found 66% of Republicans said they trusted the network, and now we find 66% say they have a favorable opinion of it.      Notes on candidates who aren't Trump:      -Ben Carson is easily the most popular candidate in the field with a 68/14 favorability rating. The closest anyone else comes to that is Marco Rubio at 58/24. Carson is also the most frequent second choice of GOP voters at 13%. And he's the only Republican who would win a head to head showdown with Trump, 49/43. Among candidates with meaningful support, only Mike Huckabee's supporters would go to Trump in a head to head with Carson. ||||| Well into his second term as president, over half of Republicans remain convinced that president Barack Obama is a Muslim, according to a poll released Tuesday by Democratic firm Public Policy Polling.      The poll finds that 54 percent of Republicans think Obama is a Muslim, 14 percent think he's a Christian and 32 percent say they are unsure.      Obama's country of birth also remains a question for Republicans. A plurality, 44 percent, say they don't think he was born in the U.S. Less than a third believe that he is American-born and slightly more than a quarter are unsure of where he was born.      Beliefs that Obama is a foreign-born Muslim are even stronger among Trump supporters. Sixty-six percent of Trump supporters surveyed think Obama is a Muslim; another 61 percent think he was not born in the U.S.      Conspiracy theories about Obama's faith, as well as his birth, have existed among Republicans since the start of his 2008 campaign and have persisted throughout his presidency. In 2010, a Pew Research report found that 31 percent of Republicans believed Obama was a Muslim. Most recently, Republican presidential hopeful Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker told The Washington Post that he didn't know if Obama was a Christian.      Obama has responded to criticism about his religion by asserting that he is in fact a Christian, but has made note that even if he practiced a different religion, that should not be treated as if it were a bad thing.      Questions about Obama's birth reached a peak in 2011 when Donald Trump became one of the more famous Republican figures to accuse Obama of not having been born in the U.S. Obama eventually released a copy of his birth certificate that proved he was born in Hawaii.      Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post notes the survey results could be overstated, and its question may have served as an excuse for some Republicans to vent their dislike of Obama by agreeing with a statement they see as negative, regardless of whether they truly believe he's a Muslim.      Public Policy Polling surveyed 572 likely Republican primary voters nationwide, reaching respondents through automated telephone interviews and online Aug. 28-30.      Correction: A previous version of this article overstated the number of Republicans who believe Obama is American-born as well as those who are unsure. ||||| Story highlights Misperceptions about Obama's religious beliefs are more common than those about his birth      Obama ultimately did release a certified long-form birth certificate in April 2011      Washington (CNN) A new CNN/ORC poll finds that although misperceptions about Barack Obama's religious beliefs and background persist, they are not as widespread as some recent polling has suggested. Obama was born in Hawaii and is a Christian.      Overall, when asked \\"Where was Obama born, as far as you know?\\" 80% of adults said they believe Obama was born in the United States. The other 20% said that he was born outside the country, including 9% who believe there is solid evidence of that and 11% who say it is just their suspicion.      Misperceptions about Obama's religious beliefs are more common than those about his birth, particularly among Republicans. Overall, 29% of Americans say they think the President is a Muslim, including 43% of Republicans.      The findings suggest beliefs about Obama's birth are remarkably stable: When ABC News and the Washington Post asked this question in the same way in April 2010, 77% of adults said Obama was born in the United States, 20% said in another country, with just 9% saying there was solid evidence Obama was not born in the United States. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A recent PPP (Public Policy Polling) national poll has highlighted that Donald Trump continues to grow his lead over the GOP field, with 29% support amongst Republican voters. This is due in part to Trump's alignment with many Republican voters' beliefs regarding Obama's religion and birthplace. According to the poll, 54% of Republicans believe Obama is a Muslim, while 44% think he was not born in the United States. Among Trump supporters, these percentages are even higher, with 66% believing Obama is a Muslim and 61% thinking he was not born in the United States. These conspiracy theories, which began during Obama's 2008 campaign, contribute significantly to Trump's popularity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Can you smell two things at once? This experiment comes from the research of two scientists from Rice University. Denise Chen and Wen Zhou have been experimenting with the science of smell, and have made some very interesting discoveries.                To explore that, you will need two things with strong, characteristic smells and, of course, your nose. The idea is to smell a different smell with each nostril  . Hold one smell very close to your right nostril, and the other smell very close to your left nostril. Then breathe in and pay close attention to what you smell.               What you should find is that one smell will be very strong. After another sniff   or two, the first smell will go away, and you will smell the other smell. Keep sniffing, and the first smell will come back. Instead of smelling the two smells evenly   mixed, they will work in turns, one after the other.               Why? Chen and Zhou found that your sense of smell acts much like your sense of sight. Hold a book in front of your nose, so that your left eye sees things on the left side of the book, and your right eye sees things on the right side of the book. You will find that your sight works in turns, first on the left side of the book and then on the right side. Notice that you can't focus your left eye on one object while focusing your right eye on another object. Your brain jumps back and forth  , paying attention to one and then the other. The same thing happens with your nostrils. If they are smelling different smells, your brain pays attention to one and then the other. Question: Denise Chen and Wen Zhou discovered that   _  . Options: A: our brain focuses on one thing at a time B: our two nostrils act differently towards the same smell C: our nose prefers to smell stronger smells D: our sense of smell is connected with our sense of sight Answer:","output":"D: our sense of smell is connected with our sense of sight"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Near the equator is the tropical zone. The tropical zone is known for being hot and wet. Between these two zones is the temperate zone. Temperatures there tend to be mild. Its not too hot and not too cold. You might expect places near the equator to be hot and wet. Thats not always the case. Sometimes there are other factors at work. These factors can affect the local climate type or a region. Oceans and mountain ranges can have a major impact. They can greatly influence the climate of an area.

After reading the above, is \\"The polar zone, the tropical zone, and the temperate zone\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What are the world's three climate zones?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"The polar zone, the tropical zone, and the temperate zone\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"What are the world's three climate zones?\\" based on the information provided in the text. To provide a more detailed explanation: 1. The Polar Zone: This zone is located near Earth's poles, both in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It experiences very long and cold winters with frigid temperatures, and the environment is characterized by ice, snow, and tundra. The polar zone has limited biodiversity due to these extreme conditions, with species like polar bears and penguins thriving in their respective polar regions. 2. The Tropical Zone: Located near the equator, the tropical zone is known for its hot and wet climate. This climate zone experiences warm temperatures throughout the year, with high levels of humidity due to frequent rainfall. The tropical zone is home to vast rainforests, which host an incredible array of biodiversity and are crucial for maintaining ecological balance across the globe. In addition to rainforests, the tropical zone also includes other ecosystems like savannas and coral reefs. 3. The Temperate Zone: Situated between the polar and tropical zones, the temperate zone experiences moderate temperatures, varying depending on its distance from the equator and other geographic factors. The temperate zone is characterized by distinct seasons, with a more pronounced variation in temperature and precipitation compared to the tropical zone. Forests, grasslands, and other ecosystems are common in this climate zone, supporting a diverse range of plant and animal life. It is important to note that while these three climate zones serve as useful generalizations, local climates can sometimes deviate from this pattern due to factors like ocean currents, altitude, and the presence of mountain ranges. These factors can influence the climate of an area significantly, leading to different local climate types on a smaller scale."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many local governments call on their people to take action to make the air cleaner. Transport is one of the biggest contributors to haze. When,where,how,why and what you drive all affect air quality. When one drives to work for one year,he uses as much energy as a bus rider uses in 10 years. So walk or ride your bicycle to work or school whenever possible. If it is necessary,you can use public transport instead of your car. Each person using public transport for a year instead of a car can save nearly a tonne of pollutants,including CO2,from going into the atmosphere. Carpooling is another way to reduce carbon emissions .Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car. It immediately reduces your car's emissions by half. What you do inside your living space can have a big effect on the air quality outside it. You can do a lot of things inside and around your home that will help you pollute less and save some money. A large amount of our energy supply comes from burning coal,another contributor to haze. By cutting down your electricity use,you are cutting down on haze. So you may try to reduce your use of electricity by turning off lights,using your air conditioner wisely during the summer months,or updating some of your electrical appliances to low-energy models. For example,you can use energy-saving lamps that require less energy and last 10 times longer than common bulbs. Question: We should reduce the use of electricity mainly because  _  .

The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.The returning Chinook, carrying the remainder of the A Company group including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. The soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined the first half of the company group on the ground. As the company group moved forward, an explosion—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—injured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller radioed in a casualty report, and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish (who had just been freed by the SAS) landed on the track through the village. The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter, which then picked up the Royal Irish and flew to RFA Sir Percivale where all 13 men were assessed by medics.The operation continued under the leadership of Matthews, the company 2IC, who had taken command almost immediately after the company commander was wounded. Under his command, each of the platoons assaulted a different cluster of buildings to which they had been assigned during training on...

These paratroopers were part of the British military operation and were being transported by the third Chinook helicopter to Magbeni. They were warned by the second SAS observation team that the ground was wet, but the exact depth of the water was unknown. As a result, they were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp when they exited the helicopter. Despite the unexpected swamp, the majority of the first group continued to wade through the water to get to the tree line and then to the village, while a smaller party that was tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.

When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, \\"But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record.\\"The musicians Lukather chose for Santamental, most of whom were involved in the hard-rock genre, lent a heavy feel to the album. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for \\"Joy to the World\\" after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing. Vai provided guitar work for \\"Carol of the Bells\\" along with Lukather's son Trevor, then 14 years old. Slash, who recorded his part in one take, played on the Lukather/Stan Lynch composition \\"Broken Heart for Christmas\\".

Now there are 2 p's left out of 16 letters, so the probability is 2/16 (or 1/8). Step 3: Find the probability of picking the t without replacement. Now there is only 1 t left out of 15 letters, so the probability is 1/15. Step 4: Multiply the probabilities from steps 1, 2, and 3 together to find the overall probability.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse. He is very tense at rehearsals, which makes us concentrate, but relaxed during the performance, which is a great asset to the...","output":"In the given context, it is mentioned that the Chicago Symphony Orchestra led by Solti and Giulini went on a European tour in 1971.

Newly hatched armyworms may have no distinguishing marks, but older armyworms will be either brown with yellow stripes or green with light stripes. Armyworm droppings resemble black pepper. If armyworms have infested your hay field, mowing the field is the first course of action. As the hay dries, the armyworms lose interest in it as a food source and move on. You can apply insecticides to the field using either ground or aerial equipment. The following insecticides have been proven effective on controlling armyworms:  Asana XL should be used only on corn crops and should not be applied within 21 days of harvest. Permethrin is also only for use on corn and should not be used within 30 days of harvest. Carbaryl (Sevin) may be applied either to corn or wheat. Do not do more than two applications and do not it apply within 21 days of harvest. Ethyl is useful for corn, sorghum and all small grains but can only be applied with an aerial application. Do not apply ethyl within 12 days of harvesting corn or sorghum, and within 15 days of harvesting small grains. After you apply the ethyl, post notices that the field is being treated, and stay out of it for three days. Lorsban can be applied to corn and sorghum. Do not allow livestock to graze in the field for at least 15 days after you apply lorsban. Do not feed meat or dairy animals grains treated with Lorsban until at least 35 days have passed. Lannate or Malathion can be used on all crops. Do not spray these insecticides within seven days of harvest and stay out of the field for two days after treatment.

While Hunter preferred the comforts and familiar routines of his local surroundings, Adam reveled in the excitement of venturing into the unknown, eager to immerse himself in the rich tapestry of life that could only be found beyond the borders of his hometown. Over the years, Adam had collected a treasure trove of memories from his many adventures. He had trekked through the dense, verdant jungles of South America in search of ancient ruins, scaled the jagged peaks of the Himalayas to stand awestruck before the stunning vistas below, and navigated the winding, narrow canals of Venice, lulled by the gentle sway of the gondola beneath him. With each new expedition, Adam's heart swelled with gratitude and appreciation for the vast beauty and complexity of the world that lay open before him. Hunter, on the other hand, found solace in the simpler pleasures of life. He enjoyed long walks in the nearby park, the friendly greetings from his neighbors, and the comforting embrace of his favorite armchair, his faithful canine companion curled by his side. While he occasionally felt a spark of curiosity about the world beyond his doorstep, Hunter was content, by and large, to live his life within the bounds of the community he knew and loved. Over countless conversations and shared experiences, the differences in the two men's perspectives often came to the fore. Hunter would listen, rapt and wide-eyed, as Adam regaled him with tales of far-flung destinations, exotic cuisines, and chance encounters that had left indelible marks on his soul. And though Hunter couldn't help but feel a measure of envy for the boundless freedom and excitement that seemed to characterize Adam's life, he also understood that his own joys and passions held an equally significant place within the broader pantheon of human experiences. The friendship between Hunter and Adam was strengthened, rather than weakened, by their contrasting philosophies on life. They taught one another the value of embracing alternative viewpoints and learning from the experiences of others. Hunter's steadfast and grounded demeanor served as an anchor for Adam, a reminder that the simple pleasures of home and community could be just as valuable, in their own way, as the thrill of continuous exploration. Likewise, Adam's tales of adventure opened Hunter's eyes to the boundless possibilities and connections that lay just beyond his comfort zone, beckoning him to take that first tentative step toward a deeper understanding of the world at large.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that studied at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\". A:","output":"The full name of the person that studied at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig is Reinhard Keiser. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig before becoming a prominent figure in the Hamburg opera scene."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? OPT:  1). no  2). yes","output":"1). No Although both questions involve exporting onions from India to another country, they are not paraphrases of each other as the destination countries are different: London (United Kingdom) and Canada. However, the process for exporting onions will share several similarities, with additional steps or considerations specific to each destination. Here is the general process for each case: Exporting onions from India to London: 1. Research and understand the market demand for onions in London and get to know the various regulations and standards required for exporting agricultural products to the United Kingdom. 2. Obtain necessary licenses and registrations, including the Importer Exporter Code (IEC) issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade in India. Also, ensure that your business is registered with the relevant tax departments. 3. Find reliable suppliers of onions in India who adhere to the standards and packaging requirements set by the United Kingdom. This may involve inspections and quality checks on the products. 4. Establish contact with potential buyers in London, like wholesalers, retailers, supermarkets, and grocery store chains. You can find buyers through market research, online sources, trade expos, and by joining industry-specific forums. 5. Set up a contract with your chosen buyers and finalize the shipping terms, pricing, and delivery deadlines. 6. Arrange for appropriate transportation, ensuring that your chosen shipping company is experienced in handling agricultural exports and deals with proper phytosanitary certificates. 7. Ensure that the onions are properly packed, fumigated, and adhere to the United Kingdom's import requirements regarding size, appearance, and labeling. 8. Organize customs clearance and necessary documentation at both the Indian export location and upon arrival in London. 9. Monitor the shipment and provide proper documentation to your buyer. Ensure payment is collected as per the agreed-upon terms. Exporting onions from India to Canada: 1. Conduct market research and investigate the demand for onions in Canada along with their specific regulations and standards for importing agricultural products. 2. Acquire the necessary licenses and registrations for exporting, including the IEC from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade in India and registration with relevant tax departments. 3. Locate dependable suppliers of onions in India, ensuring they are compliant with the quality and packaging standards set by Canada. 4. Identify potential buyers in Canada, such as wholesalers, retailers, supermarkets, and grocery stores. Use various channels, like market research, online sources, trade expos, and industry forums to make connections. 5. Negotiate and establish contracts with your Canadian buyers, finalizing terms like shipping, pricing, and delivery deadlines. 6. Coordinate with a shipping company that has experience handling agricultural exports and can provide the necessary phytosanitary certificates for Canada. 7. Make sure the onions are appropriately packed, fumigated, and meet Canadian import requirements in terms of sizing, appearance, and labeling. 8. Organize customs clearance, documentation, and inspections in India and Canada. 9. Keep track of the shipment and provide documentation to your buyer. Collect payment per the agreed-upon terms. Essentially, the process for exporting onions to both London and Canada from India has overlapping steps, but because the destination countries differ, the regulatory requirements and potential buyers will vary. The two questions are not paraphrases as they address two different export scenarios."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The incident took a chilling turn as Bell fired a total of 34 shots at the officers involved. Background Alistair Bell, a resident of Kirkheaton, West Yorkshire, had a known history of violence. His actions on the day of the standoff showcased the dangerous extents to which an individual can go when pushed to the edge. The Standoff The tense situation began when a police officer went to Bell's residence to arrest him. In response, Bell aimed a loaded gun at the officer, initiating the six-hour standoff that would follow. Over the course of the next several hours, he fired 34 shots at the police officers surrounding his residence.  Desperation and Distress: Phone Call to Father During the siege, Bell made a phone call to his father, Gordon Bell, informing him that he had \\"shot two coppers\\". In a further display of his disturbed mental state, Bell confessed to his father that he was suicidal and inquired about the best method to end his own life. This conversation illustrated the depths of Bell's despair and desperation during the prolonged standoff. Resolution and Tragic Consequence The standoff ultimately ended when a police officer managed to shoot Alistair Bell in the head. The gunman's life was taken in order to protect the lives of the other officers involved in the standoff and to prevent any further acts of violence from occurring. Conclusion Alistair Bell's six-hour standoff with police officers in West Yorkshire serves as a stark reminder of the tragic consequences that can emerge from situations involving individuals with a history of violence. Furthermore, this incident highlights the importance of providing support and intervention for those struggling with mental health issues and violent tendencies, in order to prevent such dire events from occurring in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: Over its thousands of islands Indonesia officially recognises the religions of Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Confucianism, Islam, Hinduism and what other?","output":"The answer is Buddhism. In addition to Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Confucianism, Islam, and Hinduism, Indonesia officially recognizes Buddhism as one of its six officially recognized religions. The recognition of these religions is based on Indonesia's principle of Pancasila, which outlines the foundation of the nation's diverse religious and cultural beliefs. Buddhism has a long history in Indonesia and has played a significant role in the country's cultural development. The roots of Buddhism can be traced back to the 2nd century CE, when it was introduced by traders and monks traveling along the ancient maritime routes between India and Southeast Asia. Buddhism flourished in the region and strongly influenced the local culture, particularly in areas around the Srivijaya Empire, a powerful maritime and trade-based empire in Sumatra, and the Sailendra dynasty in Java. At its height, the Sailendra dynasty gave rise to some of the world's most impressive Buddhist monuments, such as the Borobudur temple in Central Java. Borobudur is a UNESCO World Heritage site and represents a pinnacle of Buddhist architecture and art in Indonesia. The temple is adorned with over 2,500 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. The reliefs provide valuable insights into ancient Javanese culture, Buddhist teachings, and the lives of the people during that period. Buddhism in Indonesia experienced a decline with the rise of Islamic kingdoms during the 13th to 16th centuries, as Islam became the dominant religion in the region. However, Buddhist communities persisted and continue to practice their faith in modern Indonesia. Today, Buddhism constitutes a minority religion in Indonesia, with practitioners mainly found in urban areas and in regions where the Chinese-Indonesian population is concentrated. According to the 2018 Indonesian census, the followers of Buddhism make up about 0.8 percent of the country's total population. The Buddhist community in Indonesia practices various forms of Buddhism, such as Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. The Indonesian government's recognition of Buddhism alongside the other five recognized religions showcases the nation's long-standing appreciation for religious freedom and diversity. The six officially recognized religions coexist in Indonesia, encouraging peaceful collaborations and dialogues among their practitioners. This religious diversity plays a crucial role in shaping Indonesia's vibrant and pluralistic society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Yellow Submarine Movie plot: Pepperland is a cheerful, music-loving paradise under the sea, protected by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an Aztec-like pyramid on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains. The land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating Blue Meanies, who live in or beyond the blue mountains. The attack starts with magical projectiles fired from big artillery stationed in the blue mountains. The Blue Meanies seal the band inside a music-proof blue glass globe, they render the Pepperlanders immobile as statues by shooting arrows and dropping giant green apples upon them (a reference to the Apple Records music label), and drain the countryside of colour. In the last minute before his capture, Pepperland's elderly Lord Mayor sends Old Fred, an aging sailor (whom the mayor calls \\"Young Fred\\"), to get help; he runs to the Yellow Submarine and takes off in it (\\"Yellow Submarine\\"). Old Fred travels to Liverpool (\\"Eleanor Rigby\\"), where he follows the depressed and aimless Ringo and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his \\"mates\\" John, George, and finally Paul in The Pier, a house-like building on the top of a hill. The five journey back to Pepperland in the yellow submarine.

Domesday Book ( or ; Latin: \\"Liber de Wintonia\\" \\"Book of Winchester\\") is a manuscript record of the \\"Great Survey\\" of much of England and parts of Wales completed in 1086 by order of King William the Conqueror. The \\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\\" states:  Then, at the midwinter [1085], was the king in Glocester with his council ... . After this had the king a large meeting, and very deep consultation with his council, about this land; how it was occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out \\"How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues he ought to have by the year from the shire.\\"  It was written in Medieval Latin, was highly abbreviated, and included some vernacular native terms without Latin equivalents. The survey's main purpose was to determine what taxes had been owed during the reign of King Edward the Confessor, which allowed William to reassert the rights of the Crown and assess where power lay after a wholesale redistribution of land following the Norman conquest.  The assessors' reckoning of a man's holdings and their values, as recorded in Domesday Book, was dispositive and without appeal.

Write some highlights for the following article: Russian academics are calling for a scientific probe into claims of a 'Siberian Loch Ness monster' in one of the world's remotest lakes. Researchers using underwater scanners have found evidence of 'Nesski' - measuring up to 33 feet in length - in the deep waters of Lake Labynkyr, says a new report. Intriguingly, the evidence is at a lake where native Evenk and Yakut people have long claimed an underwater creature lurks. Proof: This photograph, said to be the head of the underwater beast, is being used as evidence to prove the existence of a Siberian Loch Ness monster. The evidence includes a picture which, it is claimed, shows the monster, says the Siberian Times. Known as ‘the Devil', testimony dating back to the 19th century says the monster has enormous jaws. Associate Professor Lyudmila Emeliyanova, of Moscow State University, told The Siberian Times that on her own scientific mission to Labynkyr she recorded ‘several seriously big underwater objects’ with sonar readings. Images have also recently emerged from a 2006 scientific trip to the lake when strange objects - one of 21ft 4in (6.5 metres) in length - were recorded on a Humminbird Piranha MAX 215 Portable fish-finder at a depth of 138 to 197 feet. Territory: Lake Labynkyr in Siberia, the alleged home of a giant 'Nesski' monster. Based on the sonic readings, researchers drew how the creature might look in real-life on the fish-finder's screen. ‘It was our fourth or fifth day at the lake when our echo sounding device registered a huge object in the water under our boat,\\" said Dr Emeliyanova of her own close encounter. It was clearly alive and too large to be one of the dozen or so known fish species in the lake. ‘The object was very dense, of homogeneous structure, surely not a fish nor a shoal of fish, and it was above the bottom,\\" she said. ‘I was very surprised but not scared nor shocked, after all we did not see this animal, we only registered a strange object in the water. But I can clearly say - at the moment, as a scientist, I cannot offer you any explanation of what this object might be.’ Lady in red: The echo device shows a mysterious shape and the scientists made a drawing, right in red, of what Nessie's Russian cousin might look like. Nesski caught: The device, normally used to find and trace fish movements discovered a strange dense object in the lake. Artists impression: The scientists have made a drawing of a not-so-happy monster on the screen. Other similar findings since her 2002 mission mean that a new scientific mission to discover the truth is essential, said Dr Emeliyanova, a biogeographer. ‘I believe there is a mystery in this lake because there is no smoke without fire,’ she said. She was told an account of two fishermen who were ‘in a 10 metre long boat when suddenly the bow began to rise as if somebody was pushing it from under the water. 'It was a heavy boat, only a huge and strong animal can do such a thing. The fishermen were stuck by fear. They did not see anything, no head, no jaws.’ Another 'sighting' came when a group of Russian geologists were fishing in the lake. ‘Suddenly those in the boat started screaming - apparently they saw a huge head of some creature. Others, who were waiting for them on shore, started shooting, and scared the creature away,’ said a witness. Monster or myth?: The local population have given testimonies on the monster they call 'the Devil' since the 19th century. A 1953 sighting of a 'monster' in neighbouring Lake Vorota by respected Soviet geologist Viktor Tverdokhlebov was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities. But now Dr Emeliyanova wants to investigate a theory that the two lakes are linked by underground tunnels. Strangely, despite being close to Oymyakon, the coldest inhabited town on Earth, the lake does not freeze completely in winter. There has been speculation in Russia  that Labynkyr and Vorota might be inhabited by a school of ichthyosaurs, prehistoric marine reptiles resembling dolphins or sharks, or  plesiosaurs, a popular theory concerning 'Nessie' in Scotland which is often depicted with a long neck. Another version is that relic killer whales could have become marooned in Labynkyr when it was attached to the sea. Some accounts even suggest the 'creature' makes a hideous primeval cry as it attacks its prey. ‘Personally, I do believe that when the information about something strange circulates among local people for so many years, it just can't be groundless, it means something is there,’ said Dr Emeliyanova. ’I know the local people very well - they are ingenuous but they do not lie.’ She stressed: ‘There are many lakes in Yakutia and around the Indigirka River, hundreds of them, big and small, their shores are more or less populated, but all the talk is about Labynkyr and Vorota lakes, and it has gone on for many dozens of years. 'It makes us think about it. And these stories about the local monster are older than those about the Loch Ness monster.’","output":"Russian academics are calling for a scientific probe into claims of a 'Siberian Loch Ness monster' in Lake Labynkyr.

However, I can evaluate the possible answers based on common professional scenarios: 1. \\"Be admired by fellow workers\\": This could happen since showing initiative and expressing an interest in personal growth can often be perceived positively by colleagues. This would especially be the case if Lee's co-workers value professional development and constant learning. 2. \\"Look like a bad person\\": This is less likely to be the result of Lee's action based on the information given. Enquiring about career progression should not inherently make someone look bad unless it's interpreted as over-ambitious or a threat but it isn't specified in the context. 3. \\"Laughed at by workers\\": This also seems unlikely as seeking career progression is a sign of ambition and seriousness about one's career. While it could potentially make Lee the subject of laughter if the work culture is particularly toxic, this is not generally expected behavior in professional environments. In summary, based on the context, it's most likely that Lee would \\"be admired by fellow workers\\" since seeking advice on career progression typically reflects positively on an individual's commitment to their job and their proactive approach towards their career growth.

Please answer the following question: My teenage son Karl became withdrawn after his father died. As a single parent, I tried to do my best to talk to him. But the more I tried , the more he pulled away. When his report card arrived during his junior year, it said that he had been absent 95 times from classes. In this way he would never graduate. I sent him to the school adviser, and I even begged him. Nothing worked. * One night I was at work when I got a phone call. A man introduced himself as a head teacher. \\" I want to talk to you about Karl's absences .\\" Before he could say another word I choked up . And said sadly, \\" I love my son. I've tried everything to get Karl to go back to school and nothing has worked. It's out of my hands.\\" For a moment there was silence on the other end of the line. The head teacher seriously said, \\" Thank you for your time.\\" * Karl's next report card showed a marked improvement in his grades. He was even on the list of the best students at school. In his fourth year, I took part in a parent-teacher meeting.I noticed that his teachers were surprised at the way he had turened himself around. On our way home, he said, \\" Mum, remember that call from the head teacher last year?\\" I nodded. \\"That was me.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"We would have died last night if it were not for you.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"If not for you, we would have died last night.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"We would have died last night if it were not for you\\" is true, then it entails the hypothesis \\"If not for you, we would have died last night.\\" This is because both statements convey a similar meaning about causality and conditionality. To analyze the relationship between these two statements, let's break down their logical structure and see how they represent the same idea. In the premise, \\"We would have died last night if it were not for you,” the words 'would have' signal a counterfactual assumption. The speaker is expressing gratitude and crediting the listener with preventing some form of harm in the scenario where the listener was not there. This statement sets up a relationship between two events: 1) the presence of the listener, and 2) the hypothetical potential bad outcome (the death of the speaker and others) of the event. The hypothesis, \\"If not for you, we would have died last night,\\" is presenting the same idea but with slightly different phrasing. It uses the conditional nature of \\"if,\\" which implies that without a specific action or factor (in this case, without the presence or intervention of the listener), the following event would have occurred (the death of the speaker and others). It also carries the same idea of a counterfactual assumption where the listener's absence would have led to a negative outcome. Both statements, when true, show that there is a relationship between the presence or intervention of the listener and the prevention of the fatal outcome. The listener's actions have a causal role in bringing about the desired effect. The two statements express nearly identical ideas; thus, if the premise holds, it entails the hypothesis. In summary, if the premise \\"We would have died last night if it were not for you\\" is true, then it does entail the hypothesis \\"If not for you, we would have died last night.\\" Both statements convey a similar meaning about the conditional nature of the circumstances, emphasizing the importance and impact of the listener's actions in preventing the negative outcome. They establish a relationship between the causal factor (the presence or intervention of the listener) and the prevention of the harmful event (the death of the speaker and others)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Lithuanian Civil War of 1432-1438 was a conflict over the succession to the throne of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after Vytautas the Great died in 1430 without leaving an heir.  The war was fought on the one side by Švitrigaila, allied with the Teutonic Knights, and on the other by Sigismund Kęstutaitis, backed by the Kingdom of Poland. The war threatened to sever the Union of Krewo, the personal union between Poland and Lithuania. Švitrigaila's alliance with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Paul von Rusdorf, launched the Polish-Teutonic War  but failed to secure victory for Švitrigaila. When Sigismund captured power in Lithuania by staging a coup in 1432, Lithuania split into two opposing camps, and there began three years of devastating hostilities. To prevent the Knights from continuing their support of Švitrigaila, Poland backed a Hussite invasion of Prussia in 1433. The war ended in a decisive defeat for Švitrigaila and his ally, the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights, at the Battle of Pabaiskas in September 1435. Švitrigaila eventually surrendered in 1437; Sigismund Kęstutaitis ruled Lithuania for only eight years before he was assassinated in 1440.

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Why did Meade lose his civil rights? - politicians stripped him of his civil rights. - he agreed to give them up to get out of prison earlier. - not enough information - he became a convicted felon.

Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player.  - The action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including handeye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes diverse subgenres such as fighting games, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games.  - The Astyanax , known in Japan as The Lord of King (        ) , is a side - scrolling action game developed by Aicom released for the arcades by Jaleco . A home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System , simply titled Astyanax , was released during the same time as the arcade version .  - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre.  - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Aicom was a Japanese video game developer, founded in 1988, possibly by a group that left Irem and Jaleco. Despite evidence to support this, the Sammy corporate website lists 1990 as the first year and that it was a subsidiary. It was bought by Sega Sammy Holdings in 1992.  - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry.   - The Sega Sammy logo is a design based on the letter S, the initial letter of both companies names. The synergy generated by the integration of the two companies are represented by a combination of blue and green, which are the companies corporate colors. Furthermore, In the logo, a curved line that suggests the horizon linking the words Sega and Sammy symbolizes the companies collaboration, and the Sega Sammy Groups determination to develop globally.  - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform.  - The full name of the company that currently uses the brand is Irem Software Engineering. It was founded in 1997 by its parent company Nanao for the purpose of taking over the development department of the original Irem Corporation that had left the video game industry in 1994 to concentrate itself on the rental and sales of coin-op electronics. Irem Corporation was founded in 1974 as IPM Co Ltd and still exists today under the name Apies.  - The original Jaleco Ltd was founded in 1974. In 2006, it decided to become a pure holding company by renaming itself Jaleco Holding and splitting its video game operations into a newly created subsidiary that took its former name of Jaleco Ltd. In 2009, Jaleco Holding sold Jaleco Ltd to Game Yarou and subsequently changed its own name to Emcom Holdings.  - Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where the game does not progress incrementally in turns.  - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development  the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support.

The reviewer compares the \\"Zenph\\" to a modern pianist trying to imitate the eminent Glenn Gould and states that it falls short. The reviewer specifies how it does not meet the standards; stating it \\"lacks Gould's touch, unique phrasing, nuance, dynamics,\\" and also mentions that \\"the piano used sounds nothing like anything Gould would employ,\\" implying they didn't find the sound pleasing or authentic. Additionally, Glenn Gould was known to be selective about the sound of his piano. Therefore, the reviewer seems knowledgeable about Gould's preferences, reinforcing their critique on the subpar sound quality.  Furthermore, the reviewer concludes their critique by labeling the product as a \\"novelty; nothing more.\\" This statement insinuates that the reviewer views the product as something interesting or unusual that does not have serious meaning or value. This hard-hitting comment suggests that the reviewer would not recommend the product since they seemingly do not believe it offers anything more than a fleeting, superficial amusement.

Write a text based on \\"congress bills will shrink surplus\\" Text:","output":"Title: New Congress Bills Set to Reduce Surplus Funds Introduction: Recent developments in the legislative arena have shown that the United States Congress is currently considering several bills that are expected to significantly reduce the government's surplus funds. These proposals, mostly revolving around additional spending and investment, aim to stimulate the economy and enhance the nation's infrastructure. In this article, we will examine the reasons behind these bills, their anticipated benefits, and the potential concerns they may raise. Reasons Behind the Congress Bills: The main rationale behind these proposed bills is the belief that the government should allocate its surplus funds more effectively. Historically, surplus budgets have often been used to pay down national debt or to save for unforeseen circumstances. However, in the current climate, many stakeholders argue that these resources could be more efficiently channeled towards areas such as infrastructure development, education, and healthcare. Anticipated Benefits: Proponents of the new Congress bills argue that redirecting surplus funds into these sectors will benefit the overall US economy in several ways: 1. Infrastructure development: By improving the nation's transportation network, Congress aims to boost economic productivity, support job growth, and facilitate commerce. 2. Education: Investing in education has long-lasting implications on the nation's workforce quality and economic growth. Strengthening the education sector is crucial in developing a skilled workforce to meet the demands of a rapidly changing economy. 3. Healthcare: Adopting advanced medical technologies and expanding access to healthcare is essential in promoting a healthier and more productive population, ultimately leading to an increase in economic output. Potential Concerns: While many advocate for the use of surplus funds to invest in these areas, others express concerns over the long-term implications of such spending. Some critics argue that allocating resources away from paying down national debt could hinder the country's financial stability in the future. Others are concerned that these bills may set a precedent for increased government spending and intervention, potentially resulting in higher taxes or inflation rates. Conclusion: The ongoing debate surrounding the proposed Congress bills showcases the challenging task of striking a balance between fiscal responsibility and social investment. As lawmakers continue to discuss and revise these initiatives, they will need to carefully weigh the benefits and potential risks associated with reducing surplus funds. Ultimately, the outcome will influence the nation's social and economic landscape for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information:  - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\"  - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor.  - East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) is an American professional wrestling promotion, founded by promoter Jim Kettner. It is home to the annual Super 8 Tournament, one of the longest-running independent wrestling tournaments in the country.it's also the home of the annual Super 8 ChickFight Tournament. In 2010, Kettner announced his retirement and turned the promotion over to Mike Tartaglia and Joe Zanolle.  - A color commentator is a North American term for a sports commentator who assists the main commentator, often by filling in any time when play is not in progress. In other regions this role is variously referred to as an analyst or summariser. The color analyst and main commentator will often exchange comments freely throughout the broadcast, when the play-by-play announcer is not describing the action. The color commentator provides expert analysis and background information, such as statistics, strategy and injury reports on the teams and athletes, and occasionally anecdotes or light humor. Color commentators are often former athletes or coaches of the sport being broadcast.  - The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a \\"human interest and a semblance of truth\\" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. Cognitive estrangement in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.  - Professional wrestling is a dramatized athletic performance inspired by competitive combat sports. Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it is a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling (holds/throws), striking, and aerialism. Various forms of weaponry are sometimes used. The content  including match outcomes  is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are performed to appear violent without injuring the wrestlers. Before the 1980s, these facts were kept highly secret, after which they were openly declared. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e., interviews) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle, making the predetermined nature of the sport something of an open secret. The presentation of scripted events as legitimate is known as \\"kayfabe\\".  - Open Secret is a 1948 American film noir directed by John Reinhardt, starring John Ireland and Jane Randolph.  - Newark is a small city in New Castle County, Delaware, west-southwest of Wilmington. According to the 2010 Census, the population of the city is 31,454. Newark is the home of the University of Delaware.  - In professional wrestling, kayfabe is the portrayal of staged events within the industry as \\"real\\" or \\"true,\\" specifically the portrayal of competition, rivalries, and relationships between participants as being genuine and not of a staged or pre-determined nature of any kind. Kayfabe has also evolved to become a code word of sorts for maintaining this \\"reality\\" within the direct or indirect presence of the general public. Though the staged nature of professional wrestling had been a frequent topic of conversation among the media and public since at least the latter years of the early 20th century, the professional wrestling industry did not formally acknowledge this until changes in the business during the 1980s professional wrestling boom prompted attitudes within the business to change. In 1989, World Wrestling Federation owner Vince McMahon testified before the New Jersey state senate that wrestling was staged. Long sanctioned by New Jersey and other states as an athletic exhibition for regulation and taxation purposes, McMahon sought to eliminate oversight, and hence taxation, on the WWF's house shows and pay-per-view events held within the state.  - In general, spectacle refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in Middle English from c. 1340 as \\"specially prepared or arranged display\\" it was borrowed from Old French \\"spectacle\\", itself a reflection of the Latin \\"spectaculum\\" \\"a show\\" from \\"spectare\\" \\"to view, watch\\" frequentative form of \\"specere\\" \\"to look at.\\" The word \\"spectacle\\" has also been a term of art in theater dating from the 17th century in English drama.  - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.  - The University of Delaware (colloquially \\"UD\\") is the largest university in Delaware. The main campus is in Newark, with satellite campuses in Dover, Wilmington, Lewes, and Georgetown. It is medium-sized  approximately 18,500 undergraduate and 4,500 graduate students. UD is a privately governed university which receives public funding for being a land-grant, sea-grant, space-grant and urban-grant state-supported research institution.  - A professional wrestling promotion (also federation or fed) is a company or business that regularly performs shows involving professional wrestling. \\"Promotion\\" also describes a role which entails management, advertising and logistics of running a wrestling event (\\"see promoter\\"). Within the convention of the show, the company is a sports governing body which sanctions wrestling matches and gives authority to the championships and is responsible for determining the divisions, rankings, etc. of wrestlers. In truth, the company serves as a touring theatre troupe, as well as event promotion body for its own events.  - The East Coast Wrestling Association ( ECWA ) is a professional wrestling promotion based in Newark , Delaware .

The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off.  In a doctor's office, two siblings both are having a small operation performed on their fingers in order to correct an identical injury. The movement of Joe's ions has been disrupted completely, but Emily's ions are still able to move normally.  Who will be more uncomfortable during the operation? A:","output":"Emily will be more uncomfortable during the operation because her ions are still able to move normally.

For example, the absolute value of -2 is 2, and the absolute value of 5 is 5. In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to return the element with highest absolute value. If a negative and positive element have the same absolute value you should return the positive element. The absolute value for negative numbers can be found by multiplying them by -1. After finding the element with the maximum absolute value you should return the value of that element before you applied the absolute value. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: [-21.288  60.628  -8.322  76.163 -64.932  47.722 -14.647] Student:","output":"To solve this problem, follow the steps outlined: 1. You are given a list of numbers. This list is [-21.288, 60.628, -8.322, 76.163, -64.932, 47.722, -14.647] 2. Your task is to first find the numbers that have the highest absolute values, so you basically consider the magnitude of the numbers disregarding the sign. You must therefore apply the absolute value to each of these numbers. 3. To obtain the absolute value of the negative numbers you simply multiply them by -1, turning them into positive numbers.    For example, the absolute value of -21.288 becomes 21.288, -64.932 becomes 64.932 and so forth. Remember, the absolute value of a positive number remains the same. 4. Now, these are your absolute values : [21.288, 60.628, 8.322, 76.163, 64.932, 47.722, 14.647]    You need to find the maximum value from these absolute values. In this case, the maximum absolute value is 76.163. 5. But remember, the problem stated that you should return the value of that element before applying the absolute value. The number 76.163 is the absolute value of 76.163 itself in the original list. So you return 76.163 as the solution to this problem.

This book was the first time that the world met Mrs.Christie's famous detective Hercule Poirot. Ten years after that, Mrs. Christie wrote her book with her second famous detective, Miss Marple. In 1928, Mrs. Christie's first marriage broke up. She married M.E.L. Mallowan in 1930, but she still wrote her books under the name Agatha Christie. In her life, Agatha Christie wrote 60 books, 16 plays, and more than 100 short stories. She passed away in 1976 when she was 85 years old. Her books can still be found on sale in bookstores all around the world. Question: What's the best title of the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"A famous writer.\\"?

Answer choices: - resistance  - cellular repair  - mutagens  - UV rays  - recovery  - radiation  - Electrical energy  - flow of electrons Answer:","output":"Damaged DNA might benefit from cellular repair mechanisms. Cells have evolved several different DNA repair pathways to maintain genomic integrity and prevent the accumulation of DNA damage that could potentially lead to genomic instability, mutations, or other detrimental effects. These repair pathways can be broadly categorized into two main types: direct repair and indirect repair. Direct repair mechanisms include base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and mismatch repair, while indirect repair mechanisms involve homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining repair. 1. Base excision repair (BER): This repair mechanism targets and corrects small base lesions caused by oxidative, alkylation, or deamination damage. It involves the removal of the damaged base by a DNA glycosylase enzyme, followed by the action of an endonuclease and a DNA polymerase to fill in the missing nucleotide and eventually a DNA ligase to seal the nick. 2. Nucleotide excision repair (NER): This repair mechanism targets and removes bulky DNA adducts, such as those formed by exposure to UV light or certain chemical mutagens. It involves the recognition and removal of a stretch of damaged nucleotides through the actions of various repair proteins such as XP proteins and ERCC family proteins, followed by the filling in of the gap by a DNA polymerase and sealing by a DNA ligase enzyme. 3. Mismatch repair (MMR): This repair mechanism corrects errors that occur during DNA replication, such as base-base mismatches or insertion-deletion loops. Mismatch repair proteins recognize and remove the mispaired bases, and the DNA polymerase fills in the correct nucleotides. 4. Homologous recombination (HR): Primarily targeting double-strand breaks, this repair mechanism uses a homologous DNA sequence from a sister chromatid as a template to repair the broken strands. This process is highly accurate and error-free, making it the preferred choice for repairing double-strand breaks during DNA replication. 5. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ): This repair mechanism also targets double-strand breaks, but unlike HR, it does not use a homologous DNA sequence as a template. Instead, the broken ends are directly ligated together, which can often result in the loss or gain of nucleotides at the break site. While less accurate than HR, NHEJ is essential for repairing double-strand breaks that occur outside of the DNA replication phase. In addition to these repair mechanisms, cells can also rely on several DNA damage response pathways that can either arrest the cell cycle to allow time for repair to occur, or trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death) if the damage is too severe to repair. These pathways involve the activation and coordination of a complex network of cellular proteins and enzymes, ensuring that DNA damage is efficiently detected and addressed to maintain genomic stability. To conclude, damaged DNA might benefit from cellular repair mechanisms such as base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, homologous recombination, and non-homologous end-joining repair. These repair pathways work in concert with the DNA damage response pathways to maintain genomic integrity and minimize the risk of detrimental genomic alterations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The cell cycle is a repeating series of events, characterizing the life of a eukaryotic cell.   Q: What does the cell cycle do?   A: Answer:","output":"The cell cycle is an essential process that governs the growth, development, and reproduction of eukaryotic cells. It allows cells to divide and produce new, genetically identical cells, ensuring the maintenance of an organism's integrity, function, and continuity of life. The cell cycle serves several important functions, which are discussed in detail below. 1. Cell growth and development: During the cell cycle, a cell grows and prepares for division by undergoing various physiological and metabolic changes. This growth phase (interphase) enables the cell to synthesize proteins, enzymes, and other essential components for proper functioning and cellular development. 2. Accurate DNA replication: One of the most crucial aspects of the cell cycle is the copying of the genetic material. Before the cell divides, its DNA must be replicated accurately to ensure that both daughter cells inherit a complete set of genetic information. This process occurs during the S phase of interphase, where the cell's DNA is precisely duplicated into two identical copies. If errors are detected during DNA replication, the cell cycle may pause to allow repair mechanisms to fix the issue, preventing the propagation of inaccuracies in the genetic code. 3. Cellular repair and maintenance: The cell cycle provides an opportunity for cells to perform necessary repairs and maintenance, including correcting DNA damage and removing dysfunctional organelles. The cell cycle allows cells to maintain their functionality and prevent the accumulation of damage, which could lead to cell death or transformation into abnormal cell types, such as cancerous cells. 4. Asexual reproduction: The cell cycle facilitates asexual reproduction in single-celled organisms, like yeast and some protists, enabling population growth and expansion. In these organisms, the division of a single parent cell via the cell cycle results in the creation of two genetically identical offspring. This type of reproduction allows these organisms to rapidly colonize new environments, adapt to changing conditions, and increase genetic diversity through mutation. 5. Cell differentiation and tissue formation: In multicellular organisms, the cell cycle plays an essential role in tissue formation and maintenance through cell differentiation. During development, the cell cycle ensures that cells divide and differentiate into specialized cell types, ultimately forming various tissues and organs required for the proper functioning of the organism. Additionally, the cell cycle enables the replacement of damaged or dead cells with new ones, contributing to the maintenance of tissue integrity and promoting healing. 6. Regulation of cell population: The cell cycle is tightly regulated, ensuring that the correct number of cells is produced at appropriate times. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the balance between cell growth and cell death, which contributes to the overall development and homeostasis of the organism. Dysfunction in cell cycle regulation may result in uncontrolled cell proliferation or cell death, leading to various diseases, including cancer. In summary, the cell cycle is vital for the life of a eukaryotic cell, as it ensures proper growth, accurate DNA replication, cellular maintenance, tissue development, and controlled cell division. By controlling the cycle of cellular events, the cell cycle contributes to the optimal functioning, development, and reproduction of organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's not because fish are endangered, though wild fish stocks in many oceans are very low. It's not because they're bad for you, though fish in many areas are exposed to poisonous substances in the water. It's because they're smart. \\"Fish are sensitive, they have personalities,\\" says the marine biologist. For Earle, eating a fish would be like eating a dog or a cat. \\"I would never eat anyone I know personally.\\" There's a lot more to fish than meets the eye: they talk to each other, they like to be touched, and they engage in behavior that can seem very human. They can remember things and learn from experience. Earle and a growing number of animal rights activists see these as strong arguments against eating fish altogether. The activists also point out that fish feel pain and fish suffer horribly on their way from the sea to the supermarket. \\"While it may seem _ that fish are able to feel pain, like every other animal, some people think of fish as swimming vegetables,\\" says Dr. Lynne Sneddon. \\"Really, it's kind of a moral question.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - Sir George Henry Martin (3 January 19268 March 2016) was an English record producer, arranger, composer, conductor, audio engineer and musician. He was referred to as the \\"Fifth Beatle\\", including by Paul McCartney, in reference to his extensive involvement on each of the Beatles' original albums. Martin had 30 number-one hit singles in the United Kingdom and 23 number-one hits in the United States.  - Brian Samuel Epstein (19 September 1934 27 August 1967) was an English music entrepreneur, best known for managing the Beatles. Epstein first discovered the Beatles in November 1961 during a lunchtime Cavern Club performance. He was instantly impressed and saw great potential in the group. Epstein was rejected by nearly all major recording companies in London, until he secured a meeting with George Martin, head of EMI's Parlophone label. In May 1962, Martin agreed to sign the Beatles, partly because of Epstein's conviction that the group would become internationally famous.  - Ferry Cross the Mersey is a 1965 musical film featuring Gerry and the Pacemakers . The film , directed by Jeremy Summers , is one of the more uncommon artifacts of the Mersey scene , shown very rarely on television and never issued on video . It was the first to be shot on location in Liverpool after the city 's emergence into the music mainstream ( which had previously seen only Frankie Vaughan , Russ Hamilton , and Billy Fury as stars ) . For authenticity , many scenes were shot in clubs near the home of Gerry and the Pacemakers ' frontman Gerry Marsden . A scene on a ferry ( the Mountwood ) on the River Mersey showed the docks as a backdrop . Marsden wrote nine new songs for the film which also starred Julie Samuel , Cilla Black singing \`\` Is it Love ? '' , Jimmy Savile , and The Fourmost . Future Doctor Who actress Elisabeth Sladen appeared in the film as an uncredited extra . The song \`\` Ferry Cross the Mersey '' was written by Gerry Marsden as the theme song for the film .

Alligator Alley - Fox News There's an old saying that you should never taunt the alligator until you've crossed the creek. Perhaps someone should mention this creed to House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH). The Ohio Republican hadn't even made his way down to the creek bank Thursday morning when he provoked the journalistic reptilia which inhabit the Congressional marsh. Boehner hit the door of the House Radio/TV Gallery Studio for his weekly news conference when he let out a loud, audible sigh - seemingly laced with exasperation. The 30 or so reporters who gathered to hear Boehner chortled at the Speaker's irritation. Perhaps they were amused that yet another round of weekly question and answer sessions managed to pique the usually unflappable Boehner. After all, wide-ranging press conferences are challenging. On Thursday, reporters asked Boehner about a contempt of Congress resolution for Attorney General Eric Holder, mandatory year-end spending cuts, the European economic meltdown, the transportation bill, student loans and what to do about leaks from the intelligence community. So it's no surprise that yet another one of these conclaves managed to rankle Boehner. But still en route to the lectern, it was Boehner who scored the first question at his own press conference. \\"Would you like to be me?\\" Boehner asked reporters rhetorically after they noted his sigh. Boehner's question hinted at the stresses he faces as Speaker of the House - such as the internecine fights he referees over the debt ceiling or the struggle to gin up enough votes to pass a troubled highway measure. But Boehner's \\"changing spaces\\" interrogatory was also a brief, \\"walk in my shoes\\" moment. In other words, would you like to trade places and undergo an inquisition like this each week? \\"This is the weekly alligator feeding,\\" said Boehner, drawing another laugh from the scribes. \\"The trick is feeding the alligators and not get bit.\\" The alligators who double as Capitol Hill reporters do bite sometimes. And sometimes, those who feed the alligators bite back. Less than hour earlier, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stood at the same podium for her weekly version of the \\"alligator feeding.\\" Of course, the Calfiornia Democrat didn't characterize the session like that. Instead, a smiling Pelosi opened the floor after brief, opening remarks. \\"With that I would be pleased to take any questions,\\" Pelosi said. And this being the Congressional Everglades, there's usually a question or two at any news conference which have more bite than the others. Liz Harrington of CNS News asked the Calfiornia Democrat about lawsuits various Catholic institutions filed against the Obama Administration over contraception rules in the health care reform law. \\"Those people have a right to sue. But I don't think they are speaking ex cathedra for the Catholic Church and there are people in the Catholic Church, including some of the bishops, who have suggested that some of this may be premature,\\" responded Pelosi. Harrington noted Pelosi's Catholic faith and quickly tried to follow up about whether she agreed with the church's teachings. This time, the bite came from the dais, not the press swamp. \\"You know what?\\" replied a curt Pelosi, raising her hand in protest. \\"I do my religion on Sunday in church and I try to go other days of the week. I don't do it at this press conference.\\" There was was lots of alligator biting underway Thursday over at the Rayburn House Office Building. The House Judiciary Committee summoned Eric Holder for a hearing. And much of the snapping back and forth took place not between lawmakers and reporters, but between Members of Congress themselves. This was particularly prominent when House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) pressed the Attorney General on whether he's been responsive to Congressional inquiries about why Fast and Furious went awry. Holder told Issa he had been responsive to Congressional subpoenas. The California Republican cut off Holder as he told the panel about thousands of pages of documents the Department of Justice produced for lawmakers. Issa, who doesn't chair the Judiciary Committee, even wagged a finger at Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) who attempted to intervene on Holder's behalf. \\"The lady is out of order!\\" scolded Issa. Issa then refocused his attention on Holder after the Attorney General reiterated that he felt the Justice Department complied with the subpoenas. \\"No! Mr. Attorney General, you're not a good witness!\\" lectured Issa. \\"A good witness answers the questions asked.\\" Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) then implored Issa to allow Holder to fully respond to his questions. Issa then conceded \\"that there was hostility between the Attorney General and myself.\\" Despite the sniping between lawmakers, Holder told the hearing that he didn't feel like alligator food. \\"I'm not feeling hostile. I'm pretty calm,\\" said Holder. For all of the daily alligator biting, there was none to be found in the House chamber. That's when House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) seized the floor to laud Pelosi on her 25th anniversary in Congress. \\"And now we note - some celebrate, others note - her attaining a quarter of a century of service in this body,\\" beamed Hoyer as lawmakers laughed. Boehner followed Hoyer to the well of the chamber to honor his counterpart. \\"The gentle lady and I from California have differing political philosophies. We've had some real battles here on the floor over the 22 years I've served with her. But the gentle lady and I have a very, very workable relationship. We get along with each other fine. We treat each other very nicely and actually have a very warm relationship,\\" said a glowing Boehner. A few minutes later, the House resumed a voting sequence. And the triumvirate of Hoyer, Boehner and Pelosi met in the well of the chamber, put their arms around one another and engaged in a brief group hug. This was a short respite from the daily alligator biting on Capitol Hill. Democrats against Republicans. Lawmakers against the president. The media against lawmakers. There are lots of alligator feedings in this version of \\"alligator alley.\\" And as Boehner says, the trick is to not get bitten.

(Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot revolves around a new crimefighter, the Batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, in stopping a major arms shipment. Although the movie is interesting enough, it's not as good as 'Mask of the Phantasm,' 'Sub-Zero,' or 'Return of the Joker.' The main reason being is that it doesn't give off the emotional appeal the other movies did. At the end of this movie, we don't really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others, especially, 'Sub-Zero.' There is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us. Even the Batwoman is not really a 'tragic' character (as Mr. Freeze or Phantasm were). Not only that, but Batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly 'stiff' and dull that the viewer doesn't really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we don't get this special emotional appeal. Don't get me wrong, I did find the movie enjoyable. It does have its moments, such as, when the audience finds out who Batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original 'Batman: The Animated Series.' The action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments. If the Batwoman's background was more interesting, this movie would have been better than 'Return of the Joker' in my book, but as it is now, it's in 4th (out of 4). As for the animation, it's the same as The New Batman Adventures' cartoon from the mid to late 1990's. The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated Batman films, but it's still good nonetheless. I do recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it is enjoyable. But just remember, it's not as good as the other Batman animated movies. 7/10 Now, what is this review like? Pick from: 1). negative 2). positive","output":"This review can be considered as a mix between positive and negative. While the reviewer acknowledges that Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is enjoyable, they provide several critiques, such as the lack of an emotionally appealing storyline and an uninteresting Batwoman character. The reviewer also points out that the movie ranks 4th among the 4 animated Batman films. However, they still give it a 7/10 and recommend it for its enjoyable action and suspenseful moments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea said on Saturday targeting the U.S. mainland with its rockets was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Donald Trump called Pyongyang’s leader “rocket man”, further escalating rhetoric over the North’s nuclear weapons and missile programs.      North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho’s remarks to the United Nations General Assembly came hours after U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers escorted by fighters flew in international airspace over waters east of North Korea in a show of force the Pentagon said showed the range of military options available to Trump.      Ri’s speech capped a week of rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, with Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un trading insults. Trump called Kim a “madman” on Friday, a day after Kim dubbed him a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”      On Saturday, the mudslinging continued with Ri calling Trump “a mentally deranged person full of megalomania and complacency” who is trying to turn the United Nations into a “gangsters’ nest”. Ri said Trump himself was on a “suicide mission” after the U.S. president had said Kim was on such a mission.      “‘President Evil’ is holding the seat of the U.S.      President,” Ri said, warning that Pyongyang was ready to defend itself if the United States showed any sign of conducting a “decapitating operation on our headquarters or military attack against our country”.      “Now we are finally only a few steps away from the final gate of completion of the state nuclear force,” Ri told the annual gathering of world leaders.      He said sanctions would have no effect on Pyongyang’s resolve to develop its nuclear weapons, with the ultimate goal being “balance of power with the U.S.”      Trump announced new U.S. sanctions on Thursday that he said allow targeting of companies and institutions that finance and facilitate trade with North Korea.      Earlier this month the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted its ninth round of sanctions on Pyongyang to counter its nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.      The U.S. bombers’ flight was the farthest north of the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea that any U.S. fighter jet or bomber has flown in the 21st century, the Pentagon said.      “This mission is a demonstration of U.S. resolve and a clear message that the President has many military options to defeat any threat,” said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White.      “We are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the U.S. homeland and our allies.”      North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., September 23, 2017. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz      North Korea has launched dozens of missiles this year, several flying over Japan, as it accelerates its program aimed at enabling it to target the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile.      Pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3 and has threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific.      Ri met with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres after delivering his speech. Guterres expressed concern to Ri over the escalating tensions and appealed for de-escalation, the United Nations said in a statement.      The Pentagon said the B-1B bombers came from Guam and their U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle fighter escorts came from Okinawa, Japan. Previous shows of force with bombers have stayed south of the demilitarized zone.      The patrols came after officials and experts said a small earthquake near North Korea’s nuclear test site on Saturday was probably not man-made, easing fears Pyongyang had exploded another nuclear bomb just weeks after its last one.      China’s Earthquake Administration said the quake was not a nuclear explosion and had the characteristics of a natural tremor.      The CTBTO, or Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty Organization, which monitors nuclear tests, and officials of the South Korean meteorological agency also said they believed it was a natural quake.      The earthquake, which South Korea’s Meteorological Agency put at magnitude 3.0, was detected 49 km from Kilju in North Hamgyong Province, where North Korea’s known Punggye-ri nuclear site is located, the official said.      All North Korea’s nuclear tests registered as earthquakes of magnitude 4.3 or above. The last registered as a magnitude 6.3.      Tensions have continued to rise around the Korean Peninsula since Pyongyang carried out its sixth test, prompting a new round of U.N. sanctions.      Trump told the United Nations on Tuesday the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies.      North Korea’s nuclear tests to date have all been underground, and experts say an atmospheric test, which would be the first since one by China in 1980, would be proof of the success of its weapons program.      The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty.

Ri also called the president a \\"mentally deranged person full of megalomania,\\" reflecting comments from Kim earlier this week, when Kim called Mr. Trump a \\"mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\\"      The North Korean diplomat claimed the North Korean regime possesses a hydrogen bomb that can be coupled with an intercontinental ballistic missile, and is prepared to use its latest technology if needed. Ri on Friday threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean.      \\"Trump might not have been aware what is uttered from his mouth, but we will make sure that he bears consequences far beyond his words, far beyond the scope of what he can handle even if he is ready to do so,\\" Ri said.      Ri insisted it is the U.S., not North Korea, that poses an international threat.      \\"The U.S. claims that the DPRK's possession of H-bomb and ICBM constitutes a global threat, even at the U.N. arena,\\" Ri said, using the acronym for the country. \\"But such claim is a big lie which is just tantamount to the notorious big lie faked up by the U.S. in 2003 about the existence of weapons in Iraq of weapons of mass destruction in order to invade that country.\\"      Ri tried to argue that nuclear muscle power isn't the DPRK's first option. North Korea, he said, also only intends to target countries that join forces with the U.S.      \\"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a responsible nuclear weapons state,\\" Ri said. \\"We will take preventative measures by merciless preemptive action unless the U.S. and its vessel forces show any sign of operating a decapitating operation on our headquarters or military attack against our country. However, we do not have any intention at all to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against the countries that do not join in the U.S.military actions against the DPRK.\\"      U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres met with Ri after his speech, and expressed concern over tensions in the North Korean Peninsula, CBS News' Pamela Falk reports, citing a readout of their conversation. Guterres asked for deescalation, and for the DPRK to implement all of the U.N. Security Council's resolutions. Guterres emphasized the need for a political solution, and for continued humanitarian aid to North Korea.      Moments before Ri was set to speak, U.S. Air Force bombers flew in international airspace east of North Korea. The Pentagon said it's the furthest north any U.S. fighters have flown in the 21st Century.      Mr. Trump has only escalated his comments about North Korea this week.      On Friday, Mr. Trump issued an executive order targeting countries that trade with North Korea. At a Friday night rally for Republican U.S. Senate contender Luther Strange in Alabama, Mr. Trump derided \\"little rocket man\\" -- his new favorite term for Kim -- and emphasized that North Korea would be dealt with. Earlier in the day, the president tweeted that he Kim is a \\"madman\\" who will be \\"tested like never before.\\"      Follow below for live updates from the speech earlier.      2:46 p.m. Ri ends his speech, to applause from the North Korean delegation      The handful of members of the North Korea delegation offered their applause as Ri walked off stage, uneventfully.      2:44 p.m.: It's foolish to think \\"barbaric\\" sanctions will deter North Korea, Ri says      Although the U.N. and U.S. have imposed tougher sanctions on North Korea and its trading partners, Ri said that won't matter.

Franco overhears him mention blackmail. Franco bends over, feigning tying his shoes and asks Lori to describe the man in the parked car. Lori does, but says that she cannot see the other man clearly. They walk back to Franco's apartment nearby and while Lori sleeps, Franco works on a puzzle when he hears a noise. Outside, the unseen man in the parked car gets out and knocks out a night watchman by the gate of a large medical complex that stands right next to the apartment building where Franco lives. The unseen man uses a screwdriver to get inside the building, goes to Dr. Calabresi's office, unlocks it and gets inside. A doctor preparing to leave for the night sees the nightwatchman unconsicious and sees a dark figure running away.The next day, the police arrive at the Terzi Institute investigating the break-in. Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus) arrives and bumps into Franco outside the institute and helps the blind man up. Carlo introduces himself and says that he's a reporter investigating the break-in. Inside, Carlo learns that nothing was stolen from the institute. Professor Terzi (Tino Carraro) tells the officers that since nothing is missing, he would rather not reveal the institutes research. Dr. Casoni (Aldo Reggiani) suggests that pictures may have been taken, but Dr. Braun (Horst Frank) says to let the cops handle the matter. Meanwhile, Dr. Calabresi (Carlo Alighiero), (the same man from the car who Franco overheard) looks at his files in his office and phones someone and agrees to meet with him. Calabresi tells his fiancee Bianca Merusi (Rada Rassimov) that he knows who broke into the institute and what was taken, but he does not wish to tell anyone yet, saying it could mean a \\"big step forward\\".

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up.

He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen.

There is at least one good reason for the desire to be attractive: beauty is power.Studies suggest that good-looking people make more money,get called on more often in class,and are regarded as friendlier. But what exactly is beauty? It's difficult to describe it clearly,and yet we know it when we see it.And our awareness of it may start at a very early age.In one set of studies,six-month-old babies were shown a series of photographs.The faces on the pictures had been rated for attractiveness by a group of college students.In the studies,the babies spent more time looking at the attractive faces than the unattractive ones. The idea that even babies can judge appearance makes perfect sense to many researchers.In studies by psychologists,men consistently showed a preference for women with larger eyes,fuller lips,and a smaller nose and chin while women prefer men with large shoulders and a narrow waist.According to scientists,the mind unconsciously tells men and women that these traits--the full lips,clear skin,strong shoulders--equal health and genetic well-being. Not everyone thinks the same way,however.\\"Our hardwiredness can be changed by all sorts of expectations--mostly cultural,\\" says C.Loring Brace,an anthropologist at the University of Michigan.What is considered attractive in one culture might not be in another.Look at most Western fashion magazines: the women on the pages are thin.But is this \\"perfect\\" body type for women worldwide? Scientists' answer is no; what is considered beautiful is subjective and varies around the world.They found native peoples in southeast Peru preferred shapes regarded overweight in Western cultures. For... A:","output":"What factors influence our perception of beauty? A. Physiological traits and genetic well-being B. Cultural expectations and societal norms C. Both A and B D. People's individual tastes and preferences"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

This unnerving moment for viewers occurred as a major broadcasting glitch, coinciding with a powerful storm and a lightning strike that plunged homes into darkness for an instant before revealing provocative images. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that a power surge caused by the lightning strike had disrupted the broadcast transmission. This disruption created a glitch that led the signal to intertwine two distinct cable channels – one showing x-rated adult films, and the other airing mainstream programs. Families, gathering around their televisions after their evening meal for some relaxation and entertainment, were in for a startling surprise. As they tuned into their favorite daily soap opera or the primetime news, they found themselves reeling at the sudden switch to explicit content. Children, teenagers, and adults alike were left bewildered, unsure of what had just transpired in front of their unsuspecting eyes. Naturally, complaints began to flood the local broadcaster's phone lines. Concerned parents demanded an explanation and were adamant that steps be taken to prevent such an incident from occurring again. Shockwaves rippled through communities as the experience was shared and discussed, resulting in an uproar and urgency for answers. On the other side of the spectrum, x-rated content-only viewers were just as dumbstruck when their screens suddenly switched to a segment of a home renovation show. Confusion became the theme of this surreal night, which no one could have ever anticipated. The broadcasting company immediately launched an internal investigation to uncover the root of the problem, as well as to study the protection measures already in place to prevent such content from appearing on family-oriented channels. Preliminary findings outlined that, despite having strict restrictions and firewalls, the intensity of the lightning strike and its consequent power surge had interfered with the system's safeguards, allowing x-rated content to slip through the cracks. As an outcome of this lightning-caused mishap, the broadcasting company has doubled down on its commitment to enhance security measures and fortify its system, ensuring that similar circumstances do not recur. This incident has also prompted other TV networks around the globe to reassess their software and hardware protection strategies, considering the consequences of an accidental crossover. In the aftermath of this shocking turn of events, discussions surrounding the importance of safe and responsible television viewing have surged, especially in families. Parents are now opting for parental control features, while also emphasizing open communication with their children related to media consumption. This unusual incident has served as a lesson to all, showcasing the impacts of elemental forces on technology and highlighting the need to improve global practices when it comes to broadcasting sensitive content. In a world where almost everything can be accessed with the touch of a screen, it is crucial to have the necessary barriers in place to protect viewers from unanticipated exposure to adult content. From the lightning strike to the eye-opening outcome, this episode has undoubtedly triggered waves of change in today's television broadcasting landscape."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:Y},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function D(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
