Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing. What are dog teeth best suited for?","output":"Dog teeth are best suited for catching, tearing, and grinding food. Let's break down the steps to justify this statement: Step 1: Analyze dog teeth structure and function Dogs have four main types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, each serving a specific purpose. Step 2: Connect teeth types to their functions - Incisors: These small, sharp teeth are situated at the front of the mouth and are used for nibbling and grooming. - Canines: Located on either side of the incisors, these long, pointed teeth can sink into prey and hold it firmly. They are primarily designed for stabbing, catching, and tearing food. - Premolars and molars: These teeth are located further back in the mouth and are designed to shear, crush, and grind food into smaller, more digestible pieces. Step 3: Take into account the carnivorous nature of dogs Dogs are predators and their teeth have evolved specifically for a carnivorous diet: catching, tearing meat, and breaking down bones. Step 4: Consider adaptation to domestication and diet changes Although domesticated dogs today might consume a wider range of food, their teeth still primarily function for their original carnivorous purpose. Modern dog diets include kibble and other processed dog foods that still require the use of tearing and grinding teeth for proper digestion. In conclusion, dog teeth are best suited for catching, tearing, and grinding food, adapted for their carnivorous nature and diet. Their different types of teeth work together to help dogs capture prey, tear meat, and break down food for easier digestion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"Jefferson's Statute of Religious Freedom was drafted in opposition to a bill, chiefly supported by Patrick Henry, which would permit any Virginian to belong to any denomination, but which would require him to belong to some denomination and pay taxes to support it.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What did Patrick Henry want to require Virginians to pay taxes to support?\\"","output":"While the provided statement does indeed answer the question, it could be further expanded and explained in a more detailed manner for better understanding. Here is a more comprehensive response: Patrick Henry wanted to require Virginians to pay taxes to support a designated church or religious denomination. This concept was reflected in a proposed bill known as the \\"general assessment bill\\" or the \\"Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion,” which Henry was a key supporter of. The bill aimed to give Virginians the freedom to choose a Christian denomination, but it would have also required them to financially support their chosen church through taxes. The assessment bill was rooted in the long-standing practice of using tax money to fund the established church in the early American colonies. In Virginia, the Anglican Church (the Church of England) was the official state church and was funded by public taxes. However, after the American Revolution, many people began to disapprove of the government's support for a single church, and they called for a disestablishment of the state religion. As a result, the assessment bill was introduced as a compromise, giving Virginians the choice to support different Christian denominations but still requiring them to fund one through taxes. In opposition to Patrick Henry's supported bill, Thomas Jefferson drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which advocated for the complete separation of church and state. This statute opposed the government's collection of taxes for religious purposes and emphasized an individual's right to determine their religious beliefs without interference from the government or mandatory funding for any religious institutions. Jefferson's Statute for Religious Freedom was eventually enacted in 1786, leading to the disestablishment of the state religion in Virginia. This landmark legislation would go on to influence the First Amendment of the US Constitution, ensuring freedom of religion and preventing the government from establishing or endorsing any specific religious denomination. In summary, Patrick Henry wanted Virginians to pay taxes in support of a chosen Christian denomination, reflecting the compromise position in the assessment bill he supported. However, Thomas Jefferson's Statute of Religious Freedom ultimately triumphed, ensuring the separation of church and state and the freedom to practice religion without mandatory financial support."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The US Air Force Fitness Test (AFFT) is designed to test the abdominal circumference, muscular strength/endurance and cardiovascular respiratory fitness of airmen in the USAF. As part of the Fit to Fight program, the USAF adopted a more stringent physical fitness assessment; the new fitness program was put into effect on 1 June 2010. The annual ergo-cycle test which the USAF had used for several years had been replaced in 2004. In the AFFT, Airmen are given a score based on performance consisting of four components: waist circumference, the sit-up, the push-up, and a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) run. Airmen can potentially earn a score of 100, with the run counting as 60%, waist circumference as 20%, and both strength test counting as 10% each. A passing score is 75 points. Effective 1 July 2010, the AFFT is administered by the base Fitness Assessment Cell (FAC), and is required twice a year. Personnel may test once a year if he or she earns a score above a 90%. Additionally, only meeting the minimum standards on each one of these tests will not get you a passing score of 75%, and failing any one component will result in a failure for the entire test.

Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two. We spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. Barry Brown: \\"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in.

The purges targeted perceived political adversaries, as well as Soviet citizens from various social backgrounds, who were accused of disloyalty and other charges. These actions led to mass incarceration, deportations, and executions, affecting a significant portion of the Soviet population. Joseph Stalin directed the purges on a national level, while his associates and regional leaders carried out the orders at local levels. During this period, Stalin began purging the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of anyone he deemed a threat or was dissatisfied with. He sought to rid the party of any remaining followers of Leon Trotsky or any external influences. This campaign of political repression targeted not just party members but also military personnel, intelligentsia, cultural figures, and ordinary citizens. Noteworthy individuals involved in carrying out the purges at various levels include Nikolai Yezhov, who headed the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) and oversaw the arrests and executions during the height of the purge. Another prominent figure was Lavrentiy Beria, who took over the NKVD after Yezhov and continued the purges on a smaller scale. Bobojon Ghafurov, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, held his position from 1946-1956, after the peak of the Great Purge. Although he was a prominent Tajikistani politician during the Soviet Era, he neither directed nor executed the purges in the Soviet Union."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The figure makes it the strongest worldwide debut ever - marginally overtaking the 529m (£421.8m) taken by Star Wars: The Force Awakens. However, the film's US takings were down sharply on the previous movie. Furious 7 opened with 147.2m (£117.3m) in the US when it was released in 2015 - but the latest instalment of the series debuted with 100.2m (£80m). The Fate of the Furious - titled Fast & Furious 8 in some territories - stars Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel, who said he felt \\"grateful, humbled and blessed\\" after the film's success. Why is the Fast & Furious franchise so popular? Rhianna Dhillon, film critic and host of BBC Radio 4's Seriously... podcast, said the success of the Fast & Furious franchise is down to its \\"universal appeal\\". \\"They're films people of all ages can enjoy, because they have that pure, unadulterated escapism about them, children and adults alike are quite happy to watch things get blown up and smashed up,\\" she said. \\"A lot of what drags movies like The Avengers down is the plot, and Fast & Furious isn't trying to compete with those heavy, convoluted storylines. This is just cars smashing into each other and it's okay to enjoy that. \\"This franchise isn't trying to be anything it's not. Ultimately, from the bottom up, it doesn't take itself too seriously.\\" Dhillon said the diversity of the cast is one of the key reasons the film series has seen continued box office success. \\"Hollywood really underestimates minority audiences,\\" she said. \\"For example, if you break down the figures, the Latino audience is huge, what with Vin Diesel's following. I think that has so much to do with it, because not many films offer that.\\" She added: \\"The franchise still attracts huge stars each time - this year as the villain we have Charlize Theron, there's an appearance from Helen Mirren. These aren't people you've never heard of, they have the most bankable movie stars in the world. \\"And Dwayne Johnson has given the films a new lease of life - when you buy a star like him, you're buying his fans as well.\\" Find out more: The Secret of The Fast and The Furious Despite the drop of nearly a third on the seventh film, the US performance of The Fate of the Furious is still pretty impressive - it accounted for nearly two-thirds of all US box office takings over the weekend. Its nearest competitor was The Boss Baby, which took a further 15.5m (£12.4m) to land second place. The film's worldwide performance was boosted by opening in China on the same weekend as other major markets, unlike the Force Awakens, which did not start screening there until several weeks later. The Fate of the Furious saw three-day takings of 190m (£151m) in China. More chapters in the Furious franchise, which began in 2001, are planned for release in 2019 and 2021.

In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years.  He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs.  In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld.  Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages.  Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published.  Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser.  While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions.  Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Answer this question: what are loan originations? The answer is:","output":"Loan originations refer to the process of creating a new loan or credit agreement between a borrower and a lender. This process involves several steps, including the borrower's application for the loan, the lender's evaluation of the borrower's creditworthiness, the negotiation of loan terms and conditions, and the signing of the loan agreement by both parties.  Loan originations occur when individuals or businesses seek financing for various purposes, such as purchasing a home, buying a car, starting a business, or funding educational expenses. The process typically begins when the borrower submits an application to a lender, such as a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. This application includes information about the borrower's financial history, income, employment status, and other relevant factors. Once the lender receives the application, it conducts an assessment to determine the borrower's creditworthiness, which is their ability and likelihood to repay the loan. This evaluation may involve checking the borrower's credit score, reviewing their financial history, and verifying their income and employment status. If the lender determines that the borrower is a suitable candidate for the loan, it then presents the loan terms and conditions to the borrower. The loan terms and conditions include various details about the lending agreement, such as the loan amount, interest rate, repayment schedule, and any applicable fees or penalties. The borrower and lender negotiate these terms until they reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. Once the terms are finalized, the borrower and lender sign the loan agreement, which legally binds them to the contract. Upon signing the agreement, the lender disburses the loan funds to the borrower, who is now responsible for repaying the loan according to the agreed-upon terms and conditions. The loan origination process is thus complete, and the borrower can use the funds for their intended purpose. It is essential to note that loan originations can vary depending on the type of loan and the specific requirements and regulations applicable to that loan. For example, the origination process for a mortgage loan (home loan) will differ from that of a student loan or a personal loan. Regardless of the loan type, however, the primary objective of loan originations is to create a legally binding credit agreement that outlines the borrower's obligation to repay the loan and the lender's rights in the event of default."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: \\"Are the beginning and ending dates for DST the same or changing every year?\\"  Context: \\"Beginning and ending dates are roughly the reverse in the southern hemisphere.

Whistleblower: Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency claims he tried to complain 10 times to his superiors. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden claims that he tried 10 times to make formal complaints about government spy programs but no one listened to him. According to testimony given to the European Parliament released on Friday the former NSA contractor claims that as a contractor, rather than a government worker, he was not protected from raising concerns and decided to take matters into his own hands. Instead of benefiting from Obama's Presidential Policy Directive 19, under which federal employees can question classified programs, Snowden felt that 'individuals like me were left with no proper channels.' 'As an employee of a private company rather than a direct employee of the U.S. government, I was not protected by U.S. whistle-blower laws, and I would not have been protected from retaliation and legal sanction for revealing classified information about lawbreaking in accordance with the recommended process,' Snowden said in his testimony according to the Washington Post. Snowden previously worked for the CIA before joining the NSA in Hawaii as a contractor from Booz Allen Hamilton. Private: The Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp office building is seen in McLean, Virginia June 11, 2013.  Contracting firm Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp fired Edward Snowden, after he admitted to releasing information on the U.S. government's broad monitoring of American's phone and Internet data. It was from there that he leaked information about the extent of NSA spying programs to the press before fleeing to Hong Kong and then seeking asylum in Russia. In his testimopny Snowden claimed that he was warned that his concerns were dangerous for his career and that he should keep his head down and maintain a low profile. 'The first were well-meaning but hushed warnings not to 'rock the boat,' for fear of the sort of retaliation that befell former NSA whistle-blowers like Wiebe, Binney, and Drake,' he said, according to the Post, before adding that the other responses were suggestions that he, 'let the issue be someone else's problem.' Snowden said that the culture of silence at the NSA was all-pervasive. Snowden testified, 'there was a unanimous desire to avoid being associated with such a complaint in any form.' The NSA disputes this account, telling The Washington Post that, 'after extensive investigation, including interviews with his former NSA supervisors and co-workers, we have not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden’s contention that he brought these matters to anyone’s attention.' 'Everyone in the intelligence community is aware of what happens to people who report concerns about unlawful but authorized operations,' he wrote. In the past, Snowden has mentioned that he tried to take four of his superiors to task over the spying program. 'I asked these people, ‘What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?' he said. 'How is that not reporting it? How is that not raising it?' Controversial: A float displaying giant likenesses of US President Barack Obama (L) and US Intelligence leaker Edward Snowden (R) makes its way during the traditional Rose Monday parade in Duesseldorf, western Germany. Snowden said that no one wanted to be associated with any complaints at the NSA. 'Even among the most senior individuals to whom I reported my concerns,” he continued, “no one at N.S.A. could ever recall an instance where an official complaint had resulted in an unlawful program being ended, but there was a unanimous desire to avoid being associated with such a complaint in any form.' The Justice Department has charged Mr. Snowden with violating the Espionage Act and the fugitiver reiterated his claim that he has taken no documents with his to Russia. 'I didn’t take any documents with me from Hong Kong, and while I’m sure they were disappointed, it doesn’t take long for an intelligence service to realize when they’re out of luck,' he said. 'I would also add, for the record, that the United States government has repeatedly acknowledged that there is no evidence at all of any relationship between myself and the Russian intelligence service,' Mr. Snowden said.

Snowden alleges that as a contractor, rather than a government employee, he was not protected under whistleblower laws, nor protected from retaliation for revealing classified information. Snowden was employed by Booz Allen Hamilton, a private company, which placed him outside the protections granted to federal employees under Obama's Presidential Policy Directive 19. After being met with numerous warnings about the consequences of raising concerns about the NSA's spying programs, Snowden chose to leak information about the extent of the NSA's spying to the press and subsequently sought asylum in Russia. The NSA disputes Snowden's claims, stating that they have found no evidence to support his claim that he brought these matters to his supervisors' attention."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first post-Reconstruction era Republican elected to Congress from Florida was William C. Cramer in 1954 from Pinellas County on the Gulf Coast, where demographic changes were underway. In this period, African Americans were still disenfranchised by the state's constitution and discriminatory practices; in the 19th century they had made up most of the Republican Party. Cramer built a different Republican Party in Florida, attracting local white conservatives and transplants from northern and midwestern states. In 1966 Claude R. Kirk, Jr. was elected as the first post-Reconstruction Republican governor, in an upset election. In 1968 Edward J. Gurney, also a white conservative, was elected as the state's first post-reconstruction Republican US Senator.

Q:Article: If you want to watch and know something about birds, you must find a good place near the bird nest . Birds sit on eggs and take care of their babies from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how to make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these: a) Each nest must have six boards  . Don't make the boards too slippery  . b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a \\"door\\". The \\"door\\" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily. c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest. d) One piece of the board should be easy to open. e) Don't forget to color the nest.

Article: In South Africa, the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes, resulting in mixed-race children. As the Europeans acquired territory and imposed rule over the Africans, they generally pushed mixed-race and Africans into second-class status. During the first half of the 20th century, the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups: Black, White, Asian (mostly Indian), and Coloured. The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu, Khoisan, and European descent (with some Malay ancestry, especially in the Western Cape). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa. It imposed a system of legal racial segregation, a complex of laws known as apartheid. Now answer this question: What was a result of these marriages?","output":"The result of the unions and marriages between European men and African women from various tribes during the period of colonization in South Africa was the creation of a mixed-race population. This mix of Bantu, Khoisan, European, and, in some cases, Malay ancestry contributed to the formation of a distinct racial group known as \\"Coloured.\\" The Coloured population occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White populations in South Africa. During the first half of the 20th century, the Afrikaner-dominated government imposed a system of legal racial segregation, called apartheid, which classified the population under four main racial groups: Black, White, Asian (mostly Indian), and Coloured. The apartheid system aimed at dividing the population and maintaining white supremacy and control over the country's economy, resources, and political power. This classification system, along with the discriminatory laws and policies that it entailed, placed the Coloured group, as well as other non-white populations, into second-class status. As a consequence of these classifications and the apartheid system, the mixed-race Coloured population faced discrimination, social and economic marginalization, and limited political representation. This significantly impacted their access to education, housing, healthcare, and employment opportunities compared to their white counterparts. The apartheid system enforced racial segregation, including separate schools, neighborhoods, and public facilities, perpetuating racial divisions and disparities in South Africa. In summary, the result of the unions and marriages between European men and African women during the colonization period in South Africa led to the emergence of a mixed-race population classified as Coloured. This racial categorization, as well as the apartheid system, severely impacted the lives of the Coloured community, relegating them to second-class status and subjecting them to social, economic, and political discrimination and marginalization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Candy Movie plot: A poet named Dan (Heath Ledger) falls in love with an art student named Candy (Abbie Cornish) who gravitates to his bohemian lifestyle â and his love of heroin. Hooked as much on one another as they are on the drug, their relationship is alternating states of oblivion, self-destruction, and despair. The film is organized in 3 acts of roughly 3 scenes each, titled Heaven, Earth, and Hell: In Heaven, the young lovers ecstatically experience sex and drugs. Constantly seeking drug money, they borrow from Candy's parents or eccentric university professor Casper (Geoffrey Rush), selling things, stealing, even prostituting when desperate. In Earth they are married and confront the realities of addiction and family life. Dan purchases the drugs; Candy becomes a prostitute. Dan steals a credit card and gets the owner's PIN, then steals money from his bank funds. Candy becomes pregnant, and despite their efforts to \\"go clean\\", the baby is delivered stillborn at 23 weeks. They finally stop taking drugs with huge effort, going through agonizing withdrawal symptoms in the process. Despite poor living conditions, constant struggles for money, and frequent disputes, they love each other very much. In Hell they experience the dissolution of their relationship and recovery. They choose to move to the country to \\"try methadone\\" as a way to ease into a more normal life. After a disastrous Sunday lunch, Candy fights with her parents, breaks down, and screams at them to leave. Eventually, she becomes involved with a neighbor, a fellow drug user, and relapses to her previous lifestyle. She has a complete mental breakdown and becomes extremely distant toward Dan. He looks up Casper again, but he has died of a drug overdose; this forces Dan to reconsider his life. While Candy recovers in a clinic, Dan gets clean and gets a dishwashing job.

However, given that it's mentioned as a \\"rug-hooking\\" get-together, it is reasonable to infer that the attendees engaged in the art of rug-hooking. Rug-hooking is a craft where rugs are made by pulling loops of yarn or fabric through a stiff woven base such as burlap, linen, or rug warp. The loops are pulled through the backing material by using a crochet-type hook mounted in a handle for leverage. This is a craft that has been popular in various cultures for centuries, often passed down from generation to generation, and often conducted in a social setting, much like quilting bees were in the past. So, at the get-together, the people would have likely gathered in a suitable space within the old house mentioned in the passage, a house described as one-third ancient log cabin and two-thirds epic add-on. Here, they would spread out their rug-hooking materials, which would include burlap, linen, or rug warp for the base; yarn or fabric for the loops, and the special hooking tool, and commence their rug-hooking. Participants would work on their individual projects, possibly sharing tips and techniques, trading yarn and fabric scraps, discussing designs, colors and patterns, or solving problems they have encountered with their projects. The host, the owner of the Irish Wolfhound dogs, might have shared stories of the dogs or allowed the guests to interact with them. As described, the dogs might have been laying around like speed bumps, adding a quaint charm to the environment. These types of get-togethers not only allow for work to be done on projects but also provide a social outlet for participants to talk, share, learn, and enjoy the companionship of like-minded people. The craft becomes a shared interest around which friends and acquaintances can bond, share a mutual love for creativity, and enjoy a pleasant social event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to find the answer to the question, we need to explore the Persian Empire's relationship with the northern India subcontinent further. Cyrus the Great's expedition marked the beginning of the Achaemenid Empire's control over the region. The Achaemenid Empire extended to cover parts of the northern India subcontinent, mainly through the actions of Darius I (also known as Darius the Great), who is said to have conquered the Punjab region around 518 BC. The Achaemenid Empire’s influence over the northern India subcontinent continued until the empire's eventual downfall in 330 BC when it was conquered by Alexander the Great. Alexander's conquest led to the end of the Achaemenid Empire and the beginning of the Hellenistic period. Based on this information, we can now determine how long the Persian empire controlled the northern India subcontinent. From the initial conquests during Cyrus the Great's reign in 530 BC to the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC, the Persian Empire's control lasted approximately 200 years. In conclusion, the given statement does not directly answer the question but provides context. To answer the question, we needed to explore the history of the Achaemenid Empire's control and determine that they ruled the northern India subcontinent for about 200 years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't worry! We can outsmart those little monsters by following some easy rules. Let's learn how to keep ourselves safe and healthy when we have allergies. 1. Avoid your triggers Allergies happen because our body doesn't like something, and we call these things \\"triggers\\". Triggers can be things like pollen, dust, or animal fur. Imagine them like cooties that we have to avoid! To stay safe, we need to know what our triggers are and keep away from them as much as possible. 2. Use caution when preparing food Sometimes, allergies can come from the food we eat. To help keep the allergy monsters away, it's important to always wash our hands and clean our cooking areas. This helps make sure there isn't any leftover food that might cause an allergic reaction. 3. Cut down on dust in your home Dust is like a playground for allergy monsters! They love to hide and play there. To keep the monsters away, we can ask our grownups to help us clean our homes, toys, and bedding regularly. This helps make sure our home is a safe place to play and rest. 4. Control the movements of family pets Our furry friends like dogs and cats can accidentally bring in allergens, like pollen, on their fur. To help keep the allergy monsters away, we can ask our grownups to help us create a pet-free area in our home. This gives us a special place to play without worrying about allergies. 5. Avoid insect bites when spending time outside When playing outside, it's important to protect ourselves from bugs that can cause allergies, like bees, wasps, and mosquitoes. We can ask our grownups to help us put on bug spray, wear long sleeves, and avoid places where these bugs live, like flowers or standing water. 6. Inform all medical staff if you have a drug allergy Sometimes medicines can cause allergies, too. To stay safe, always tell your doctor and nurses if you're allergic to any medicines. They can give you other options to make you feel better without the allergy monsters coming to play. 7. Keep your EpiPen with you An EpiPen is like a superhero's tool to fight allergy monsters! If you know you have a very strong allergy, your doctor might give you an EpiPen. Always keep it with you, just like a superhero would, and ask your grownups to help you use it if you need to. 8. Take your medication as directed If your doctor gives you special medicine to help with allergies, be sure to take it exactly as they tell you to. This will help keep the allergy monsters from causing any trouble. 9. Get allergy shots Sometimes, we can train our body to fight the allergy monsters by getting shots called \\"allergy shots\\" or \\"immunotherapy\\". These shots help our body get used to the allergy triggers, so they won't bother us as much. Remember, allergies can be tricky, but by following these rules, we can keep those little monsters away and stay safe and healthy while having fun! Always ask your grownups for help and let them know how you're feeling if you think allergy monsters might be bothering you. Together, we can outsmart allergies!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Question: Information:  - Ten Foot Pole is an American punk rock band, formerly on Epitaph Records.  - Rev is the second album by Ten Foot Pole , and the last to feature Scott Radinsky .  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics.

The label was originally \\"just a logo and a P.O. box\\" created in the 1980s for the purpose of selling Bad Religion records, but has evolved into a large independent record label. Gurewitz took the name from a King Crimson song of the same name. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most of the bands on Epitaph were punk and pop punk groups, while there are many post-hardcore and bands signed to the label as well. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid.

Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I puchased this unit for my 7th grade daughter. The voice speaking the phrases was so soft, especially on the Spanish side, that we figured we got a broken one right out of the box. Franklin customer service promptly sent me a replacement, and I was shocked to see it has exactly the same problem -- even when the volume is turned up full you can barely hear the voice you are supposed to learn from. I called Customer Service again, thinking they must have heard about this problem before, but they said that must just be how the unit works, and they denied having had a lot of complaints about it. If that's true, I'm really surprised. The speaking function is a big disappointment, from the volume standpoint. I can't really comment on the unit otherwise, but I am quite disappointed by this Franklin product. Answer:","output":"Based on this review, the user would most likely not recommend this product.

This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem. During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable.

Question: Information:  - The carrot (\\"Daucus carota\\" subsp. \\"sativus\\") is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow varieties exist. Carrots are a domesticated form of the wild carrot, \\"Daucus carota\\", native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.  - Silphium (also known as silphion, laserwort, or laser) was a plant that was used in classical antiquity as a seasoning and as a medicine. It was the essential item of trade from the ancient North African city of Cyrene, and was so critical to the Cyrenian economy that most of their coins bore a picture of the plant. The valuable product was the plant's resin (\\"laser\\", laserpicium, or lasarpicium).  - Lovage, Levisticum officinale, is a tall perennial plant, the sole species in the genus Levisticum in the family Apiaceae, subfamily Apioideae, tribe Apieae.  - Parsley or garden parsley (Petroselinum crispum) is a species of \\"Petroselinum\\" in the family Apiaceae, native to the central Mediterranean region (southern Italy, Greece, Algeria, and Tunisia), naturalized elsewhere in Europe, and widely cultivated as a herb, a spice, and a vegetable.  - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.  - Dill (\\"Anethum graveolens\\") is an annual herb in the celery family Apiaceae.  - Caraway, also known as meridian fennel, and Persian cumin, (\\"Carum carvi\\") is a biennial plant in the family Apiaceae, native to western Asia, Europe, and North Africa.  - Apium (including celery and the marshworts) is a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, with a subcosmopolitan distribution in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Australia. They are medium to tall biennials or perennials growing up to 1 m high in the wet soil of marshes and salt marshes, and have pinnate to bipinnate leaves and small white flowers in compound umbels. Some species are edible, notably \\"Apium graveolens\\", which includes the commercially important vegetables celery, celeriac and Chinese celery. \\"Apium bermejoi\\" from the island of Minorca is one of the rarest plants in Europe, with fewer than 100 individuals left.  - Centella asiatica, commonly known as centella, is a small, herbaceous, frost-tender perennial plant of the family Mackinlayaceae or subfamily Mackinlayoideae of family Apiaceae, and is native to wetlands in Asia. It is used as a medicinal herb in Ayurvedic medicine, traditional African medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine. It is also known as the Asiatic pennywort or Indian pennywort in English, among various other names in other languages.  - Pastinaca ( parsnips ) is a genus of flowering plant in the Apiaceae , comprising 14 species . The economically most important member of the genus is Pastinaca sativa , the parsnip .  - Chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium), sometimes called garden chervil to distinguish it from similar plants also called chervil, or French parsley, is a delicate annual herb related to parsley. It is commonly used to season mild-flavoured dishes and is a constituent of the French herb mixture fines herbes.  - Celery (\\"Apium graveolens\\"), a marshland plant in the family Apiaceae, has been cultivated as a vegetable since antiquity. Celery has a long fibrous stalk tapering into leaves. Depending on location and cultivar, either its stalks, leaves, or hypocotyl are eaten and used in cooking.  - Sperm is the male reproductive cell and is derived from the Greek word () \\"sperma\\" (meaning \\"seed\\"). In the types of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the gametes with the smaller one being termed the \\"male\\" or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis. It is also possible to extract sperm through TESE. Some sperm banks hold up to of sperm.  - Asafoetida is the dried latex (gum oleoresin) exuded from the rhizome or tap root of several species of \\"Ferula\\", a perennial herb that grows tall. The species is native to the deserts of Iran and mountains of Afghanistan and is mainly cultivated in nearby India. As its name suggests, asafoetida has a fetid smell, but in cooked dishes, it delivers a smooth flavour reminiscent of leeks.  - Anise ('), also called aniseed\\"', is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae native to the eastern Mediterranean region and Southwest Asia. Its flavor has similarities with some other spices, such as star anise, fennel, and licorice.  - Cicely or sweet cicely (Myrrhis odorata) is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the celery family Apiaceae. It is one of two accepted species in the genus Myrrhis.  - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds.  - Endosperm is a tissue produced inside the seeds of most of the flowering plants following fertilization. It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in the human diet. For example, wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread (the rest of the grain is included as well in whole wheat flour), while barley endosperm is the main source of sugars for beer production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut \\"meat\\" and coconut \\"water\\", and corn. Some plants, such as orchids, lack endosperm in their seeds.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - The parsnip (\\"Pastinaca sativa\\") is a root vegetable closely related to the carrot and parsley. It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.  - Apiaceae or Umbelliferae, is a family of mostly aromatic flowering plants commonly known as the celery, carrot or parsley family. The family, which is named after the type genus \\"Apium\\", is large, with more than 3,700 species spread across 434 genera; it is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants. Included in this family are the well-known plants: angelica, anise, arracacha, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, \\"Centella asiatica\\", chervil, cicely, coriander (cilantro), culantro, cumin, dill, fennel, hemlock, lovage, cow parsley, parsley, parsnip, cow parsnip, sea holly, giant hogweed and silphium (a plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct).  - Fennel (\\"Foeniculum vulgare\\") is a flowering plant species in the carrot family. It is a hardy, perennial herb with yellow flowers and feathery leaves. It is indigenous to the shores of the Mediterranean but has become widely naturalized in many parts of the world, especially on dry soils near the sea-coast and on riverbanks.  - The gymnosperms are a group of seed-producing plants that includes conifers, cycads, \\"Ginkgo\\", and gnetophytes. The term \\"gymnosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word \\"\\" ( gymnos, \\"naked\\" and  sperma, \\"seed\\"), meaning \\"naked seeds\\", after the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). Their naked condition stands in contrast to the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, often modified to form cones, or at the end of short stalks as in \\"Ginkgo\\".  - Angelica is a genus of about 60 species of tall biennial and perennial herbs in the family Apiaceae, native to temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, reaching as far north as Iceland and Lapland and Greenland. They grow to tall, with large bipinnate leaves and large compound umbels of white or greenish-white flowers.  - Coriander (or ; \\"Coriandrum sativum\\"), also known as cilantro or Chinese parsley, is an annual herb in the family Apiaceae. All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are the parts most traditionally used in cooking.

Mary Chapin Carpenter (born February 21, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter. Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C. clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records, who marketed her as a country singer. Carpenter's first album, 1987's Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989's State of the Heart and 1990's Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts. Carpenter's most successful album to date remains 1992's Carpenter was born in Princeton, New Jersey, to Chapin Carpenter Jr., a Life Magazine executive, and Mary Bowie Robertson. Carpenter lived in Japan from 1969 to 1971 before moving to Washington, D.C. She attended Princeton Day School, a private coeducational prep school, before graduating from The Taft School in 1976.  Carpenter described her childhood as \\"pretty typical suburban\\", with her musical interests defined chiefly by her sisters' albums of artists such as The Mamas & the Papas, The Beatles, and Judy Collins. When Carpenter was 16 her parents divorced, an event that affected Carpenter and that she wrote about in her song \\"House of Cards\\". Carpenter spent much of her time in high school playing the guitar and piano; while at Princeton Day School, her \\"classmates threatened to cut her guitar strings if she played 'Leaving on a Jet Plane' one more time.\\" Despite her interest in music, Carpenter never considered performing publicly until, shortly after graduating from Taft, her father suggested that she perform at a local open-mic bar, a stressful experience for the shy Carpenter, who recalled, \\"I thought I was going to barf.\\" Carpenter also hosted an open-mic night at a bar in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington, DC for a number of years.  Carpenter graduated from Brown University in 1981 with a degree in American Civilization. Carpenter played some summer sets in Washington's music scene, where she met guitarist John Jennings, who would become her producer and long-time collaborator. However, she considered music a hobby and planned on getting a \\"real job\\". She briefly quit performing, but after several job interviews decided to return to music. Carpenter was persuaded by Jennings to play original material instead of covers. Within a few years, she landed a manager and recorded a demo tape that led to a deal with Columbia Records.

Please answer the following question: Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road.

Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Centastage helping playwrights find their voice, audience Twenty-five years ago, Boston playwrights had few outlets for their work. And yet, says playwright, director, and teacher Joe Antoun, a lot of people were writing plays. So Antoun and John Schumacher launched Centastage, a theater company dedicated exclusively to producing world premieres of plays by New England writers. The company’s latest production is “Academy Fight Song,” by Andrew Clarke, which runs Sept. 10-26 in the Calderwood Pavilion. “Once the word got out about our mission, we had 50-60 scripts sent to us every year,” says Antoun, who serves as artistic director while Schumacher is executive director. The company produced two or three plays each season, sometimes grouping short works together, such as “The Xmas Files” (holiday-themed plays) and “Boston Sings Boston” (cabarets of new songs by local songwriters. Centastage also co-produced the Women on Top Festival with Underground Railway Theater for six years, showcasing new work by women. Award-winning playwright Melinda Lopez, whose first full-length play, “The Order of Things,” was produced by Centastage in 2000, calls Antoun “a tireless champion of interesting, challenging, quirky new voices.” “Joe saw a very early draft of the play, which was about quantum physics and cancer and Cuba,” Lopez says, “and he thought that was a perfectly natural subject.” With Antoun’s help, the play went on to win the Kennedy Center Fund for New Plays award. “It was the first time I realized maybe there is something to this new play thing,” Lopez says. “Maybe a person can write plays for a living.” While Antoun says he focuses on the script, Lopez and others say he often sees something in writers at a critical early phase of their career. “Centastage produced ‘Emerald City,’ one of my first plays, in 2001,” says award-winning playwright John Kuntz. “Emerald City” was a very loose adaptation of “The Wizard of Oz” that included a first-act climax with the cast dancing to “Downtown” by Petula Clark. “It was a wacky, ambitious play,” says Kuntz. “I’m not sure who would have produced it besides Joe. I didn’t know I could write a play like that at the time, so it was a very important moment for me as a playwright.” Antoun also provided a platform for artists new to the Boston theater scene, including the Gold Dust Orphans’ first production of “How Mrs. Grinchley Nearly Swiped Christmas” in 1999. “Joe was always very kind to me,” says award-winning playwright Ryan Landry. “We were quite the demanding ladies back in those days, and we might have driven him a bit crazy, but he encouraged us, which was so important then.” After several years of producing a regular season of plays, including “Heart of Jade” by Gip Hoppe, “More Than What” by Janet Kenney, “Boy X Man” by Ed Bullins, and “Dancing Downstream” by Bill Lattanzi, Centastage stepped away from mounting full seasons. “We felt we weren’t serving the playwrights,” says Antoun. “Selecting the plays began to feel like a contest, and sometimes we were pushing plays out there too early.” Centastage shifted its energies into play development, launching Write On!, a writing group for playwrights, hosting a Dark Night series of play readings, and producing plays only when Antoun felt they were ready, which now means once every couple of years. “That approach allows us to latch onto a script, either through the writing group or in the staged readings, and then we can work together on it,” Antoun says. “That’s how we found ‘Fakus’ [by Joe Byers, which Centastage produced in 2013] and ‘Academy Fight Song.’ ” “Academy Fight Song” follows a college professor who agrees to appear at an academic conference with a former student who has become a literary star, in the hopes of receiving job security. His appearance, however, goes horribly wrong, and trouble ensues. Clarke says he’s worked with Antoun on the script on and off for the past five years, but he’s known him for nearly 20 years, as they both teach playwriting at Emerson College. “I trust Joe’s instincts,” says Clarke. “Besides, he knows exactly who to cast, and I’m always amazed at what actors bring to the table.” “The plays that appeal to me have a strong voice,” says Antoun. “I’m glad we’ve been able to help some writers get their work onstage, but I’d be just as happy to see other theaters in other cities produce these plays.” At Nicholas Martin Hall, Calderwood Pavillion, Boston Center for the Arts, What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. Centastage is a theater company founded 25 years ago by Joe Antoun and John Schumacher, focused on producing world premieres of plays by New England writers, initially producing two or three plays each season. 2.

Context: While these concerns were there and expressed in great detail, there was also great anticipation by people looking for the new opportunities that were to be gained from this piece of legislation, basically for their freedom from the red tape from Ottawa which they have been wrapped up in for so long. Hypothesis: One of the new opportunities gained from this piece of legislation is the ability to purchase ice cream from the cafeteria.","output":"The given context does not provide any information or evidence that could lead to your proposed hypothesis. There is nothing mentioned in the details that stipulates one of these new opportunities as being the ability to purchase ice cream from the cafeteria. From the context, the primary anticipation and expectation surrounding the new legislation appear to be the potential for greater freedom from the bureaucracy and red tape of Ottawa, implying that there might be regulatory, procedural, operational or even legislative hindrances that have previously affected some individuals or entities, reducing their efficiency, progress or general ease of operations. The given context implies that these hindrances have somehow hampered the freedom of these entities or individuals, and the expectation is for more streamlined operations, functions or activities - a comparative ease compared to the status quo, in the wake of the legislation. However, it does not draw any direct or indirect references to ice cream, cafeterias, or related industries, processes or outcomes. Contextual interpretations, therefore, should generally be drawn logically, based on the information explicitly provided or implicit. One can delve into potential outcomes of greater freedom from red tape – like the potential for streamlined operations, enhanced efficiency, lower costs and service delays, perhaps even increased innovation due to less bureaucracy. However, it's important to stick to the information provided, making reasonable and verifiable conclusions. The hypothesis about the ability to purchase ice cream from the cafeteria, unfortunately, lacks the necessary contextual grounding and support to be a valid presumption from the given context. Without more information connecting the legislation to cafeteria operations or specific references to ice cream, this hypothesis appears random and unconnected to the information we have at hand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The backstory takes place in 12th century England, where Lord Thibault Malféte is about to marry Princess Rosalind, the daughter of the reigning King. At the wedding banquet, by mistake, an enemy known as the Earl of Warwick gives Thibault a potion which makes him hallucinate (and which was actually intended for Rosalind by a witch hired and paid by the Earl), and under its influence, he kills his own bride (rather than her father, as in the French version) believing she is a ferocious monster. While under sentence of death, he asks his servant, André Le Paté to find a wizard to help him. The wizard gives him a potion that will send him back to the moment before he killed Princess Rosalind. The incompetent wizard botches the spell, and instead, Thibault and Andre are sent into the 21st century. They end up in a museum in Chicago where they are arrested by the police. They are rescued by Julia Malféte, a museum employee who closely resembles Princess Rosalind. She thinks that Thibault is her distant French cousin who drowned while yachting a couple of years ago. Thibault soon finds out that Julia is descended from his family and realizes he must return to the 12th century to correct the past. Julia introduces them to the modern American style of life where norms from medieval times no longer apply.

Nintendo Entertainment System: To differentiate Nintendo's new home platform from the early 1980s' common perception of a troubled and shallow video game market, the company freshened its product nomenclature and positioning, and it established a strict product approval and licensing policy. The overall system was referred to as an \\"Entertainment System\\" instead of a \\"video game system\\", which was centered upon a machine called a \\"Control Deck\\" instead of a \\"console\\", and which featured software cartridges called \\"Game Paks\\" instead of \\"video games\\". The 10NES lockout chip system acted as a lock-and-key coupling of each Game Pak and Control Deck, deterring the copying or production of NES games which had not first achieved Nintendo's licensed approval. The packaging of the launch lineup of NES games bore pictures of a very close representation of the actual onscreen graphics of the game, which were of sufficiently recognizable quality on their own. Symbols on the launch games' packaging clearly indicated the genre of the game, in order to reduce consumer confusion. A 'seal of quality' was printed on all appropriately licensed game and accessory packaging.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: What will man be like in the future --- in 5,000 or even 50,000 years from now? We can only make guesses, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, because man is slowly changing all the time. Let us take an example. Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average , men are about three inches taller. 500 years is relatively  a short period of time, so we may suppose that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modern world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still use only about 20% of the brain's capacity . As time goes on, however, we shall have to use our brains more and more, and finally we shall need our brains more and more, and finally we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring a physical change too. The head, especially the forehead , will grow larger. Nowadays our eyes are used too much. In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a long time it is possible that man's eyes will grow stronger. On the other hand, we make use of our arms and legs less. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive  because they are used a lot in modern life. But what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both men and women are likely to be hairless. Perhaps all this gives the impression that future man will not be a very attractive  person to look at! This may be true.However, future man will still have a lot in common with us. He will still be a person, with thoughts and feelings similar to our own. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about man in the future? Options: A: He is hairless because hair is no longer useful. B: He has smaller eyes and wears better glasses. C: His fingers grow weaker because he doesn't need to use them. D: He thinks and feels in a different way. A:","output":"After reading the article, I will analyze each option provided to determine which statement is true about man in the future: A: He is hairless because hair is no longer useful.

(Associated Press)      France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius speaks during a press meeting at the Quai d' Orsay, in Paris, Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2013. Fabuis said France will float a resolution in the U.N. Security Council... (Associated Press)      The surprise Russian proposal, which Syria and the United States both accepted, would put President Bashar Assad's regime's chemical stockpile under international control before its eventual dismantling. The initiative _ also cautiously endorsed by Britain and France _ appeared to offer a way out of a crisis that raised the prospect of U.S.-led military action against Syria in retaliation for an alleged chemical weapons attack last month.      But the plan ran aground as the world powers haggled over the crucial element of how to enforce it. Wary of falling into what the French foreign minister called \\"a trap,\\" Paris and Washington are pushing for a U.N. Security Council resolution to verify Syria's disarmament. Russia, a close Assad ally and the regime's chief patron on the international stage, dismissed France's proposal as unacceptable.      The dizzying diplomatic maneuvering threatened what had been growing momentum toward a plan that would allow President Barack Obama to back away from military action. Domestic support for a strike is uncertain in the United States, even as Obama seeks Congress' backing for action _ and there has been little international appetite to join forces against Assad.      Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said early Tuesday during a trip to Moscow that Damascus \\"agreed to the Russian initiative as it should thwart the U.S. aggression against our country.\\"      Before departing Moscow in the evening, al-Moallem told Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen TV that Syria would place its chemical weapons locations in the hands of representatives of Russia, other unspecified countries and the United Nations. Syria will also declare the chemical arsenal it long denied having, stop producing such weapons and sign conventions against them.      Mindful that Damascus could only be seeking to avoid Western military strikes, France said it would put forward a draft resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, making it enforceable with military action.      French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the French resolution would demand that Syria open its chemical weapons program to inspection, place it under international control, and ultimately dismantle it. A violation of that commitment, he said, would carry \\"very serious consequences.\\" The resolution would condemn the Aug. 21 attack and bring those responsible to justice, he said.      \\"We do not want this to be used as a diversion,\\" Fabius said. \\"It is by accepting these precise conditions that we will judge the credibility of the intentions expressed yesterday.\\"      Obama threw his support behind the French resolution and discussed the matter with French President Francois Hollande and British Prime Minister David Cameron. At the same time, he continued to push his original plan to win congressional authorization for U.S. airstrikes against Assad's regime in case the diplomatic efforts fail. Obama was to address the nation from the White House on Tuesday night.      The prospect of a deal that could be enforced militarily met swift opposition from Russia, which has provided economic, military and diplomatic support to Assad throughout the 2 1/2-year conflict.      President Vladimir Putin said the plan can only work if \\"the American side and those who support the U.S.A, in this sense, reject the use of force.\\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told his French counterpart that it is unacceptable for the resolution to cite Chapter 7, the U.N. resolution authorizing force, his ministry said in a statement.      U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in turn, said the U.S. rejects a Russian suggestion that the U.N. endorsement come in the form of a non-binding statement from the Security Council president.      The U.S. has to have a full resolution _ one that entails \\"consequences if games are played and somebody tries to undermine this,\\" he said.      Obama is sending Kerry to Geneva to discuss the issue with Russia's foreign minister, a State Department official said. The two are to meet Thursday. The official was not authorized to discuss the mission publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.      The Russian Foreign Ministry said in statement that Lavrov and Kerry spoke by telephone and the two \\"agreed to continue contacts, including the possibility of holding a personal meeting in the coming days.\\"      The U.S. and its allies have insisted Assad must be punished for last month's chemical weapons attack outside Damascus. The Obama administration, France and others blame the regime, but Damascus says rebels _ not its forces _ were behind the attack. The U.S. has said more than 1,400 Syrians died; even conservative estimates from international organizations put the toll at several hundred.      Obama, who was to deliver a national address on Syria later Tuesday, cautiously welcomed the initial Russian proposal. But he said the U.S. is still prepared to go ahead with strikes if it falls through.      \\"The key is, to paraphrase Ronald Reagan, that we don't just trust, but we also verify,\\" Obama told CBS on Monday. \\"The importance is to make sure that the international community has confidence that these chemical weapons are under control, that they are not being used, that potentially they are removed from Syria and that they are destroyed.\\"      Obama said the idea had been broached in his 20-minute meeting with Putin last week on the sidelines of an economic summit in St. Petersburg, Russia. Obama said he directed Kerry to have more conversations with the Russians and \\"run this to ground.\\"      What has been left unaddressed in the flurry of diplomacy is the broader civil war in Syria, a conflict that has already claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people and forced more than 6 million Syrians _ nearly a third of the population _ to flee their homes.      The Syrian National Coalition, the main Western-backed opposition group, dismissed the Assad government's turnaround as a maneuver to escape punishment for what it called a crime against humanity. The coalition had been hoping for military strikes from abroad to tip the balance in the war of attrition between rebels and Assad's forces.      In a statement Tuesday, the Coalition said Moscow's proposal \\"aims to procrastinate and will lead to more death and destruction of the Syrian people.\\"      \\"Crimes against humanity cannot be dropped by giving political concessions or by handing over the weapons used in these crimes,\\" the group said.      The plan would allow Assad to avoid the damage that U.S.-led strikes, no matter how narrow and limited, would likely inflict on a Syrian military already stretched thin and under tremendous strain from the civil war. While Assad would be forced to relinquish his chemical arms stockpile, doing so is unlikely to deal a devastating blow to his war machine.      Nor is it likely to stanch the bloodshed. The U.S. and the Syrian opposition accuse the regime of using such weapons on several occasions, but the casualties from those attacks have been a mere fraction of the total death toll from the conflict.      \\"What does it change if you take the chemical weapons from Bashar Assad? Does it stop the real danger?\\" asked Loay al-Mikdad, a spokesman for the Western-backed Free Syrian Army. \\"He's not just killing us with chemical weapons.

The surprise Russian proposal, which Syria and the United States both accepted, would put President Bashar Assad's regime's chemical stockpile under international control before its eventual dismantling. The initiative was also cautiously endorsed by Britain and France, and it appeared to offer a way out of a crisis that raised the prospect of U.S.-led military action against Syria in retaliation for an alleged chemical weapons attack last month. The plan, however, stalled as the world powers haggled over the crucial element of how to enforce it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Information:  - Austrofascism was the authoritarian rule installed in Austria with the May Constitution of 1934, which ceased with the annexation of the newly founded Federal State of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938. It was based on a ruling party, the Fatherland Front (\\"Vaterländische Front\\") and the Heimwehr (Home Guard) paramilitary militia. Leaders were Engelbert Dollfuss and, after Dollfuss's assassination, Kurt Schuschnigg, who were previously politicians of the Christian Social Party, which was quickly integrated into the new movement.  - Engelbert Dollfuss (; October 4, 1892  July 25, 1934) was an Austrian Christian Social and Patriotic Front statesman. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament, banned the Austrian Nazi party and assumed dictatorial powers. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934, he cemented the rule of austrofascism through the authoritarian \\"First of May Constitution\\". Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents in 1934. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitlers annexation of Austria in 1938.  - The Kingdom of Italy was a state founded from 1861, when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy, to 1946, when a constitutional referendum led civil discontent to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic. The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state.  - The Heimwehr (\\"Home Guard\\") or sometimes Heimatschutz (\\"Homeland Protection\\") were a nationalist, initially paramilitary group operating within Austria during the 1920s and 1930s; they were similar in methods, organisation, and ideology to Germany's Freikorps. Although opposed to parliamentary democracy, the Heimwehr maintained a political wing known as the Heimatblock, which cooperated with Engelbert Dollfuss' conservative government. In 1936, the Heimwehr was absorbed into the Fatherland Front by decree of Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg and replaced by a militia supposedly less inclined towards uproar against the regime, the \\"Frontmiliz\\".  - Italian Fascism, also known simply as Fascism, is the original fascist ideology, as developed in Italy. The ideology is associated with the National Fascist Party, which under Benito Mussolini ruled the Kingdom of Italy from 1922 until 1943, the Republican Fascist Party that ruled the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945, the post-war Italian Social Movement and subsequent Italian neo-fascist movements.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before it spread to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is usually placed on the far-right within the traditional leftright spectrum.  - The National Fascist Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\\", PNF) was an Italian political party, created by Benito Mussolini as the political expression of fascism (previously represented by groups known as \\"Fasci\\"). The party ruled Italy from 1922 when Fascists took power with the March on Rome, to 1943, when Mussolini was deposed by the Grand Council of Fascism.  - Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (29 July 1883  28 April 1945) was an Italian politician, journalist, and leader of the National Fascist Party (\\"Partito Nazionale Fascista\\"; PNF), ruling the country as Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943. He ruled constitutionally until 1925, when he dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship. Known as \\"Il Duce\\" (The Leader), Mussolini was the founder of Italian Fascism.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Kurt Alois Josef Johann Schuschnigg (14 December 1897  18 November 1977) was Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria from the 1934 assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss until the 1938 \\"Anschluss\\" with Nazi Germany. He was opposed to Hitler's ambitions to absorb Austria into the Third Reich.  - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889  30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.  - The Italian Social Republic, informally known as the Republic of Salò, was a state with limited recognition that was created during the later part of World War II (in existence from 1943 until 1945). Mussolini had originally intended to call his new republic the Italian Socialist Republic. It was the second and last incarnation of the Fascist Italian state and was led by Duce Benito Mussolini and his reformed Republican Fascist Party. The state declared Rome as its capital, but was \\"de facto\\" centered on Salò (hence its colloquial name), a small town on Lake Garda, near Brescia, where Mussolini and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was headquartered. The RSI exercised nominal sovereignty in northern and central Italy, but was largely dependent on German troops to maintain control.  - The Republican Fascist Party (PFR) was a political party led by Benito Mussolini during the German occupation of Central and Northern Italy. It was founded as the successor of former National Fascist Party as an anti-monarchist party. It considered King Victor Emmanuel III to be a traitor after he had signed the surrender to the Allied powers.  - The Fatherland Front ( German : Vaterländische Front , VF ) was the ruling political organisation of \`\` Austrofascism '' . It claimed to be a nonpartisan movement , and aimed to unite all the people of Austria , overcoming political and social divisions . Established on 20 May 1933 by Christian Social Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss as a one - party along the lines of Italian Fascism , it advocated Austrian nationalism and independence from Nazi Germany on the basis of protecting Austria 's Catholic religious identity from what they considered a Protestant - dominated German state . The Fatherland Front which was strongly linked with Austria 's Catholic clergy , absorbed Dollfuss 's Christian Social Party , the agrarian Landbund and the right - wing paramilitary Heimwehren , all of which were opposed to socialism , free - market capitalism and liberal democracy . It established an authoritarian and corporatist regime , the Federal State of Austria , which is commonly known in German as the Ständestaat ( \`\` corporate state '' ) . According to the Fatherland Front , this form of government and society implemented the social teaching of Pope Pius XI 's 1931 encyclical Quadragesimo anno . The Front banned and persecuted all its political opponents , including Communists , Social Democrats -- who fought against it in a brief Civil War in February 1934 -- but also the Austrian Nazis who wanted Austria to join Hitler 's Greater German Empire . Chancellor Dollfuss was assassinated by the Nazis in July 1934 . He was succeeded as leader of the VF and Chancellor of Austria by Kurt Schuschnigg , who ruled until the invigorated Nazis forced him to resign on 11 March 1938 . Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany the next day . The Fatherland Front maintained a cultural and recreational organisation , called \`\` New Life '' ( Neues Leben ) , similar to Germany 's Strength Through Joy .

Given the question: Given the following context:  In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force.  They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold.  Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace.  He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776.  Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights.  With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command.  After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands.  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham? The answer is:","output":"Ethan Ethan Allen was the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham during the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775. Allen was one of the leaders of the Patriot forces, which included the Green Mountain Boys, militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut. Together with Benedict Arnold, they managed to surprise the small British garrison stationed at the fort, which led to its capture and the acquisition of cannons and armaments essential for the Patriots in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

City girl Meg Tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returns home to her family's rural digs, only to be faced with a mystery: why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways? Radiation thriller, with barely a nod to ecology, has small town residents going berserk, which (laughably) includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and Tim Matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench. The picture is too silly for words, wasting Tilly's wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it can't possibly hope to get out of. Some of the cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth is good (particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage), though he is let down by the scrappy editing--and a fairly bathetic finale.

The letterhead on correspondence still bears the Bexar County Legal Aid name, even though the organization is no longer. Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said.  Question: \\"What are the functions of Hall's firms in the Rio Grand Valley?\\" Answer: \\"Assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation, assist migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation, as well as to operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many haikus are inspired by objects in the natural world, such as trees, rocks, mountains, and flowers. To get ideas for your poem, take a walk in a park nearby or go for a hike in the woods. Can we infer the following? Haikus are often inspired by the Earth.","output":"Yes, we can infer that haikus are often inspired by the Earth, particularly by elements found in nature. Haikus are a form of traditional Japanese poetry that typically focus on the natural world, its beauty, and its transient nature. This deep connection to the environment and ecosystem is a hallmark of haiku poetry. When writing a haiku poem, there are certain steps and guidelines you can follow to create a piece that embraces this rich poetic tradition. 1. Familiarize yourself with the structure: Haikus typically follow a 5-7-5 syllable pattern across three lines. The first line contains 5 syllables, the second line has 7 syllables, and the third line has 5 syllables. It's essential to adhere to this format when composing a traditional haiku. 2. Choose a subject from nature: As mentioned earlier, most haikus are inspired by the natural world. Use a scene or image from nature as the primary focus of your poem. An aspect of the changing seasons, the behavior of an animal, or the characteristics of a plant or landscape are all suitable subjects. 3. Employ sensory details: A successful haiku creates a vivid, sensory experience for the reader. To achieve this, use concrete, descriptive words that evoke the scene you're trying to depict. Focus on the sights, sounds, smells, and textures that the scene or object presents. 4. Emphasize the present moment: Haikus often capture a brief, in-the-moment experience, creating a sense of immediacy. As you write your poem, focus on a single moment and strive to express it with clarity and simplicity. 5. Incorporate a sense of contrast or surprise: A key aspect of haiku is the juxtaposition of two contrasting images or ideas, which often creates a sense of surprise or revelation for the reader. This technique, known as \\"cutting,\\" can be achieved through the use of punctuation or by positioning the contrasting elements on separate lines. 6. Embrace simplicity: Haikus are characterized by their simplicity and brevity. Avoid using flowery language or overly complicated expressions. Instead, aim for clarity and conciseness when expressing your ideas. 7. Practice and revise: As with any form of writing, practice is essential. Write multiple drafts of your haiku to refine your language, imagery, and structure. Share your work with others for feedback and take the time to edit and revise your poem until you're satisfied with the final result. With these guidelines and an appreciation for the beauty of the natural world, you'll be well on your way to crafting a haiku poem that captures the essence of the Earth and its myriad wonders."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A small wooden yacht carrying a family began taking on water, prompting the alarmed crew to call for help near the popular Lady Bay Beach, which is no ordinary beach—it's a widely-known nudist site. As the yachts set sail for the annual race, which garners around 600,000 onlookers each year, a few of these spectators noticed the vessel angling towards Lady Bay Beach. Chris Pearce, a Getty photographer who happened to be there, initially thought the yacht's crew were attempting to drop someone off. But he heard a child and an adult on board exclaiming, \\"Come help, come help,\\" as their boat rapidly filled with water. At this crucial moment, members of the nudist community sprung into action, wading in to lend a hand. A woman and a child were rescued and, with the help of the bare-skinned heroes, the boat was successfully pulled ashore. This amusing and unconventional rescue played out with a backdrop of amused onlookers and bystanders. Pearce explained, \\"Everyone basically just stopped and watched and looked as this happened.\\" He added that many people initially found the whole scene comical due to its unique setting, but quickly became serious as the rescue unfolded.  The incident lasted around five minutes, during which a few hundred people watched the heroic efforts of the nude rescuers. One of the men aboard the sinking yacht was seen grinning as the naked helpers surrounded the boat, demonstrating the light-hearted and extraordinary nature of this unusual maritime rescue. Thus, a potential disaster was averted all thanks to the quick-thinking nudist community and their unhesitating willingness to help fellow humans in need, providing both a memorable moment for all who experienced it and, above all, a celebration of the human spirit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: Needs Improvement - An Underwhelming and Confusing Experience I recently downloaded the app \\"org.sufficientlysecure.keychain\\" after hearing about its potential in managing my encryption keys in a secure and efficient manner. To be fair, the idea behind the app is commendable, and I appreciate the developers' intentions to provide a tool to help users maintain their privacy and protect their data. However, I must say that my experience with the app was underwhelming and often caused confusion due to its subpar interface and lack of proper guidance. I am giving it 2-stars because I believe there is some potential, but there is substantial room for improvement. Firstly, the user interface of the app is rather outdated and not very intuitive. It took me quite a while to figure out how to navigate and perform basic tasks. New users like myself may find it difficult to understand how the app functions and locate essential features such as creating, importing, or managing keys. Moreover, there's a lack of helpful prompts or tooltips to guide a user. A more streamlined design would significantly improve the usability and overall experience. Secondly, the absence of a comprehensive user manual or tutorial leaves a lot to be desired. For an app that deals with encryption and key management, it is essential to have proper guidance to ensure users, especially those who are new to encryption, can learn to use the app effectively and leverage its full capabilities. In its current state, the app does not provide enough information to assist users in understanding how to use it or provide examples of real-life use cases. Additionally, I encountered multiple bugs and crashes while using the app, which further diminished my confidence in its reliability. There were instances when the app would freeze or crash, requiring me to restart it repeatedly. Furthermore, there were occasions when the app failed to import some of my keys or to properly encrypt or decrypt messages. A more robust error handling system should be implemented to improve the app's reliability and ensure users' satisfaction. Despite my negative experience, I must say that the app's developers have the right idea in creating a tool to manage encryption keys securely. With some improvements in the user interface, the addition of a comprehensive tutorial or manual, better handling of errors, and addressing the reported bugs, I believe the app could become an indispensable tool. In conclusion, I can only give the \\"org.sufficientlysecure.keychain\\" app a 2-star rating. I hope that the developers will take my feedback into consideration and improve the app in future updates. With proper attention and enhancements, the app has the potential to become a reliable and useful tool for secure key management and end-to-end encryption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: A confession: I quietly love flying. This year, I've done 163,581 miles of it. I love that when you fly a lot, the airport social media staff say 'hello' on Twitter when you arrive and the cabin crew on your home route (or even on the Brisbane-Dubai non-stop route) recognise you from last time. I like getting great service, and see so many things about systems-thinking that work well in airlines, that I'm happy to forgive small indiscrepancies when they occur. All that said, flying strangles our planet as much as eating too much red meat, and for many, many reasons, I've wanted to stop flying quite so much, while not restricting the spread and growth of the ideas from our firm, NoTosh. I'm quite sure that nobody reading this blog really cares about how much I travel, but keeping an annual count on it has become a new year habit. When I started working at Channel 4, and then continuing when I created NoTosh, I wanted to keep track of what seemed like an interminable number of miles on the road and in the air. By 2012, 2013 and last year, I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever be able to get the number of miles down when they seemed to represent even more trips to the moon and back each and every year. When you run a company based in Edinburgh with a great team living in Melbourne, you could easily spend your life on a plane - one flying to Melbourne feels better than two or more flying to Edinburgh. Indeed, in 2012, 2013 and 2014 it felt like I really did spend my life on a plane, as I went to the moon and back in my annual travel, with anything up to seven trips a year to Australia. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How does the author feel about flying to Melbourne?

Later that evening, second vice president Keyser, upon the request of the strikers, addressed a workingmen's meeting at Cross Street Market Hall, and presented the company's written response reprinted in the papers for the public. The letter, signed by both King and Keyser, stated the company's position as follows: the company would not negotiate on the matter of the 10 percent wage reduction, but it would \\"be pleased to address itself to the investigation of any of the minor grievances of which the men complained\\". The Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser reported a general hope that, owing to the imminent increase in traffic due to the transport of harvested crops, the firemen would be able to make daily round trips, thus avoiding layovers, and that the company could arrange for them to return home on passenger trains when this was not feasible.Keyser's reprinted response advised that the ten percent cut was \\"forced upon the company\\", but that he was confident they would be able to provide more full employment, and thus increase wages, due to an abundance of freight to be moved. He said that a system of passes would be arranged to address the issue of idle time caused by delays.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance? ?  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Emily and her boyfriend had just had a fight. She felt alone and hopeless. Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone.  What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) .  For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \\"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California.  \\"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \\"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper.  Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own.  Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \\"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge .

The idea of a 75-year-old man traveling the country-side on a riding mower certainly doesn't have much appeal to it, but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than \\"The Straight Story.\\" The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenage girl. She's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out. Alvin tells her a story about his own kids, long ago. He had them each take a stick and break it, which they could easily do. Then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them. \\"That bundle,\\" he said, \\"is family.\\" So many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger. \\"The Straight Story\\" realizes that we're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions. Alvin's journey across Iowa is full of such refreshingly un-Hollywood character interactions. Each interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can't help but smile as he makes his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey. It's a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets--to their benefit and ours. It's a slow, simple, relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we've lost with the urbanization of America. \\"The Straight Story\\" is the rare live-action \\"G\\"-rated movie that truly should not be missed.

So while they slept - my mother actually had the courage to break the Child Labor Law. She made us work. We had to wash dishes, make beds, and learn to cook. We had to wear clean clothes and take a bath every day. The other kids always wore their clothes for days. We reached the height of disgrace because she made our clothes herself, just to save money. I believe she laid awake at night thinking up mean things to do to us. Through the years, things didn't improve a bit. We could not lie in bed \\"sick\\" like our friends did, and miss school. Our marks in school had to live up to expectations. Our friends' report cards had beautiful colors on them, black for passing, red for failing.

When the five of them arrived at the hotel, they invited Geri to tea in the lobby  . While sipping tea, the gentlemen presented her with a small gift which she eagerly opened. She was thrilled with the gift and shouted excitedly, \\"Oh, it's beautiful!\\" At this point, the four Japanese gentlemen stood up and, bowing only very slightly, said \\"Sayonara\\" and left immediately. Poor Geri was left astonished. What did she do wrong? Everything! Her jeans were the first gaffe. Even if you're coming off a bicycle in Japan, you do not meet c1ients   casually dressed. The second mistake was Geri's handling of their business cards rudely. In Japan, the business card is one of the most important communicative tools.

Gabrielle Giffords among the wounded and a federal judge among the six dead, police said.      The dead in the shooting outside a Tucson grocery included U.S. District Judge John Rolf, Gabe Zimmerman, a Giffords aide, and a 9-year-old girl who died at a Tucson hospital from her injuries, CNN reported. The Pima County Sheriff's Office said six people were killed and 13 wounded.      Giffords, D-Ariz.,was shot in the head at close range and was still in critical condition at 6 p.m. Saturday.      Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, at a news conference in Tucson, identified the suspect as Jared Lee Loughner, 22, of Tucson. Dupnik also said police were searching for a \\"person of interest\\" who may have driven Loughner to the scene and aided him in other ways.      The Arizona Republic reported Loughner posted a number of disturbing messages on his MySpace account and on YouTube. A few hours before the shooting outside a Tucson grocery, he posted a farewell on MySpace: \\"Goodbye. Dear friends . . . Please don't be mad at me.\\"      One posting on YouTube said \\"Don't trust the current government, listener.\\"      The White House was monitoring the situation, and FBI agents have been dispatched to the scene, CNN reported.      Giffords was holding an event outside a Safeway supermarket when the shooting started.      The congresswoman had previous brushes with violence. Her office was vandalized in March after she voted for the Obama healthcare plan, shots were fired at an Arizona office during the 2008 campaign and an armed protester was removed by police from a 2009 event.      Meanwhile, in Washington, Capitol Police released a statement advising all members of Congress to take \\"prudent precautions\\" for their personal security.      Related UPI Stories ||||| U.S. Rep.

(Associated Press)      Giffords was among at least 10 people wounded, and the hospital said her outlook was \\"optimistic\\" and that she was responding to commands from doctors. The hospital said a 9-year-old child was among those killed, and a U.S. Marshal said a federal judge was also fatally shot in the attack.      Giffords spokesman C.J. Karamargin said an unspecified number of her staff members were injured in the shooting. Congressional officials said an aide to Giffords was killed, and President Barack Obama said five people died in all.      Police say the shooter was in custody, and was identified by people familiar with the investigation as Jared Loughner, 22. Pima County Sheriff's officials said he used a pistol to carry out the shooting spree. U.S. officials who provided his name to the AP spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release it publicly.      The shooting prompted an outpouring of sympathy from politicians and people around the country. Obama called the shooting \\"an unspeakable tragedy\\" and that such \\"a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society.\\" Obama sent his FBI director to oversee the investigation.      \\"It's not surprising that today Gabby was doing what she always does, listening to the hopes and concerns of her neighbors,\\" Obama said in a nationally televised news conference. \\"That is the essence of what our democracy is about.\\"      Federal law enforcement officials were poring over captured versions of a MySpace page that belonged to Jared Loughner and over Youtube video published to the Internet weeks ago under an account \\"Classitup10\\" and linked to him. The MySpace page, which was removed within minutes of the gunman being identified by U.S. officials, included a mysterious \\"Goodbye friends\\" message published hours before the shooting which exhorted his friends to \\"Please don't be mad at me.\\"      In one of several Youtube videos, which featured text against a dark background, Loughner described inventing a new U.S. currency and complained about the illiteracy rate among people living in Giffords' congressional district in Arizona. Two spellings of his last name were given in the aftermath of the shooting _ Loughner and Laughner.      \\"I know who's listening: Government Officials, and the People,\\" Loughner wrote. \\"Nearly all the people, who don't know this accurate information of a new currency, aren't aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil rights, then this message wouldn't have happen (sic).\\"      Three hours after the shooting, the L-shaped shopping center in Tucson was blocked off by police and had fire trucks and other vehicles in its parking lot that blocked the view of the store's front door. No shell casings could be seen from the area 500 yards (460 meters) from the store where reporters and photographers were kept.      Outside Giffords' office on Capitol Hill, a handful of congressional staffers could be seen walking into her office without comment, some with roller bags and one who was in tears. About a half dozen yellow flowers, placed by one mourner, sat outside the door.      U.S. Marshal for Arizona David Gonzales confirmed to the Associated Press that U.S. District Judge John Roll also died in the attack.      Giffords, 40, was re-elected to her third term last November. She was a member of the Arizona House and Senate before coming to Washington.      Giffords tweeted shortly before the shooting, describing her \\"Congress on Your Corner\\" event: \\"My 1st Congress on Your Corner starts now. Please stop by to let me know what is on your mind or tweet me later.\\"      Giffords is married to astronaut Mark E. Kelly, who has piloted space shuttles Endeavour and Discovery. The two met in China in 2003 while they were serving on a committee there, and were married in January 2007.      In a statement of condolence, Sen. Bill Nelson, chairman of the Senate Commerce Space and Science Subcommittee, said her husband is training to be the commander of the next space shuttle mission slated for April. His astronaut brother is currently serving aboard the International Space Station, he said.      Giffords was first elected to Congress amid a wave of Democratic victories in the 2006 election, and she won a narrow victory against a favorite of the ultraconservative tea party movement in the 2010 election.      She has been mentioned as a possible Democratic nominee in 2012 for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Jon Kyl, who has not said whether he'll run again, or for the governor's office in 2014.      The shooting comes amid a highly charged political environment that has seen several dangerous threats against lawmakers but nothing that reached the point of actual violence.      A San Francisco man upset with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's support of health care reform pleaded guilty to threatening the Democratic congresswoman and her family, calling her directly on March 25 and threatening to destroy her Northern California home if she voted for health care reform.      In July, a California man known for his anger over left-leaning politics engaged in a shootout with highway patrol officers after planning an attack on the American Civil Liberties Union and another nonprofit group. The man said he wanted to \\"start a revolution\\" by killing people at the ACLU and the Tides Foundation.      Giffords herself has drawn the ire of the right, especially for her support of Obama's health care reform bill from politicians like Sarah Palin.      Her Tucson office was vandalized a few hours after the House vote to approve the health care law in March, with someone either kicking or shooting out a glass door and window. In an interview after the vandalism, Giffords referred to the animosity against her by conservatives. Palin listed Giffords' seat as one of the top \\"targets\\" in the November elections because of the lawmakers' support for the health care law.      \\"For example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted list, but the thing is, that the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they have to realize that there are consequences to that action,\\" Giffords said in an interview with MSNBC.      In the hours after the shooting, Palin issued a statement in which she expressed her \\"sincere condolences\\" to the family of Giffords and the other victims.      Capitol police responded to the shooting by advising lawmakers and their staff to \\"take reasonable and prudent precautions regarding their personal security.\\"      Despite her clashes with the right, Giffords describes herself as a former Republican and current Blue Dog Democrat. The Blue Dogs are moderate centrist Democrats.      \\"You know, actually as a former Republican, you know, I consider myself someone who is pretty in the middle, I'm a blue dog Democrat, and one that is interested in making sure that our country maintains our prosperity and frankly, our superiority over other countries and that's where we look at these threat, obviously our defense budget, our level of education,\\" she said in an interview with Fox News earlier this week.      ___      Associated Press Writers Jacques Billeaud, Pauline Arrillaga and Paul Davenport in Phoenix and Matt Apuzzo in Washington contributed to this report.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1]  I am facing a new situation today: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which location most probably didn't suffer land loss or similar processes, location A or location B? A:","output":"Location A most probably didn't suffer land loss or similar processes because the loss of biodiversity in this location is temporary.

Two months later, at the Battle of Lepanto, the united Christian fleet destroyed the Ottoman fleet, but was unable to take advantage of this victory.

By Tom Jones      A man who jumped on his fiancée’s car as a thief drove away with his son inside says he did what he had to do to save his son.      Malcom Milliones says he had one thing on his mind.      \\"Get my son out,\\" he told Channel 2’s Tom Jones.      Video surveillance from the Murphy USA gas station on Old National Highway and Flat Shoals recorded Milliones holding onto the Silver 2014 Kia Optima Sunday around 11 a.m.      He says it all began when he pulled up to the gas pumps.      \\"I was parked here. My fiancée pulled up directly behind me bumper to bumper,\\" he said.      He says his fiancée went into the store and he began pumping gas for his car.      Milliones says that's when the thief, who appeared to be a teenager, jumped in his fiancée’s car and took off.      \\"I'm kind of like this, hopping with it and running with it,\\" he said, describing how he was holding on for dear life as the car thief drove his fiancé’s SUV out of the gas station.      He says he held on while the thief drove nearly a quarter of a mile.      \\"We went from here all the way around the parking lot,\\" Milliones explained, showing the distance he traveled.      He says he was beating on the window trying to let the thief know his son was inside.      When that got the driver's attention, Milliones says his son thought quickly.      \\"My son took that opportunity to jump out and he fell out like right here at the entrance to the Popeye’s,\\" he said. His son is OK.      Milliones says he later was thrown off the SUV and the thief got away, with his accomplice following behind in a black Toyota Corolla.

Write an email with the subject line \\"CNG Fuel Waivers\\".","output":"Subject: CNG Fuel Waivers [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you today regarding the sought-after Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fuel waivers and our plans to utilize this cleaner and more environmentally friendly fuel source within our organization. As you may be aware, transitioning to CNG has a myriad of benefits, including reduced emissions, cost savings, and improved air quality. I wanted to share vital information about available waivers and the potential impact that this transition may have on our business operations. As part of our commitment towards environmental sustainability, we have been exploring options to shift our existing fleet of vehicles to those powered by CNG and make a substantial reduction in our carbon footprint. In addition, the adoption of CNG offers long-term financial savings, given the typically lower fuel costs when compared to traditional gasoline or diesel. These benefits align well with both our economic and environmental objectives. To assist organizations like ours in adopting CNG as an alternative fuel, various governmental and non-governmental agencies offer waivers and incentives. Here are some of the primary CNG fuel waivers and incentives we may be eligible for: 1. Alternative Fuels Tax Credit: This federal program provides tax credits for businesses that utilize alternative fuels, such as CNG. Eligible parties can claim up to 0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) of CNG used in their fleets. 2. Clean Cities Coalition Network: This network of coalitions promotes the use of cleaner transportation alternatives, including CNG. They provide technical, financial, and informational assistance to organizations looking to transition their fleets to CNG fuel. 3. Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Program: As part of the Federal Highway Administration's CMAQ program, funds are allocated to local and state transportation agencies to finance projects that improve air quality and reduce congestion. These agencies may offer incentives for CNG vehicle purchases and fueling infrastructure development. 4. State and Local Grants: Various states and local agencies offer grants to organizations that demonstrate a sincere commitment to alternative fuel adoption. The availability and terms of these grants vary depending on the local jurisdiction. To fully benefit from these waivers and incentives, our company needs to evaluate and determine which options would yield the highest return on investment and align with our strategic goals. In order to accomplish this, I suggest forming a task force that will conduct the following: 1. Assess existing fleet requirements and identify suitable CNG vehicle models. 2. Investigate initial investment costs related to CNG vehicles, infrastructure, and maintenance. 3. Analyze potential savings, GHG emissions reductions, and environmental benefits of transitioning the fleet to CNG. 4. Determine applicable CNG fuel incentives, waivers, and grants while reviewing deadlines and stringent qualification requirements. 5. Develop a comprehensive plan for the adoption of CNG vehicles, and submit required documentation and applications to relevant government agencies to secure waivers and incentives. I look forward to discussing this initiative further and collaboratively identifying the next steps towards transitioning our fleet to CNG fuel. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and I will be more than happy to address them. Our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility can only be strengthened by pursuing opportunities such as these. Thank you for your consideration.

Courageous is a term generally used to describe someone who is brave and able to face difficult situations or challenges without being overcome by fear.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK albums chart and 15 weeks at number one in the US. On release, the album was lauded by the vast majority of critics for its innovations in music production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for providing a musical representation of its generation and the contemporary counterculture. By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger\\". The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The polite and restrained Japanese audiences shocked the band, because the absence of screaming fans allowed them to hear how poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting the First Lady Imelda Marcos, the group had grown unhappy with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.  After the Beatles' return to London, George Harrison replied to a question about their long-term plans: \\"We'll take a couple of weeks to recuperate before we go and get beaten up by the Americans.\\" His comments proved prophetic, as soon afterwards Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable US tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadiums and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes:  To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.  Upon the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.","output":"This text is about the Beatles, an English rock band.

Here the People Rule In fact, “There is a broad public consensus regarding the causes of the current problems with financial institutions and markets: 79 percent say people taking on too much debt has contributed a lot to the crisis, while 72 percent say the same about banks making risky loans.” This seems sensible. Indeed, as Sept. 11 did not result in a much-feared (by intellectuals) wave of popular Islamophobia or xenophobia, so the market crash has resulted in remarkably little popular hysteria or scapegoating. And considering what has happened, the vulgar public on Main Street has been surprisingly forgiving of those well-educated types on Wall Street — the ones who devised and marketed the sophisticated financial instruments that have brought the financial system to the brink of collapse. Most of the recent mistakes of American public policy, and most of the contemporary delusions of American public life, haven’t come from an ignorant and excitable public. They’ve been produced by highly educated and sophisticated elites. Needless to say, the public’s not always right, and public opinion’s not always responsible. But as publics go, the American public has a pretty good track record. In the 1930s, the American people didn’t fall — unlike so many of their supposed intellectual betters — for either fascism or Communism. Since World War II, the American people have resisted the temptations of isolationism and protectionism, and have turned their backs on a history of bigotry. Now, the Pew poll I cited earlier also showed Barack Obama holding a 50 percent to 40 percent lead over John McCain in the race for the White House. You might think this data point poses a challenge to my encomium to the good sense of the American people. It does. But it’s hard to blame the public for preferring Obama at this stage — given the understandable desire to kick the Republicans out of the White House, and given the failure of the McCain campaign to make its case effectively. And some number of the public may change their minds in the final two weeks of the campaign, and may decide McCain-Palin offers a better kind of change — perhaps enough to give McCain-Palin a victory. The media elites really hate that idea. Not just because so many of them prefer Obama. But because they like telling us what’s going to happen. They’re always annoyed when the people cross them up. Pundits spent all spring telling Hillary Clinton to give up in her contest against Obama — and the public kept on ignoring them and keeping her hopes alive. Why do elites like to proclaim premature closure — not just in elections, but also in wars and in social struggles? Because it makes them the imperial arbiters, or at least the perspicacious announcers, of what history is going to bring. This puts the elite prognosticators ahead of the curve, ahead of the simple-minded people who might entertain the delusion that they still have a choice. But as Gerald Ford said after assuming the presidency on Aug. 9, 1974, ”Here the people rule.” One of those people is Joe Wurzelbacher, a k a Joe the Plumber. He’s the latest ordinary American to do a star turn in our vulgar democratic circus. He seems like a sensible man to me. And to Peggy Noonan, who wrote that Joe “in an extended cable interview Thursday made a better case for the Republican ticket than the Republican ticket has made.” At least McCain and Palin have had the good sense to embrace him. I join them in taking my stand with Joe the Plumber — in defiance of Horace the Poet.

Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) heads out with his local Jindabyne, Australia fishing buddies for a weekend of rest, recreation, and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal woman's body floating face-down in a river, things appear to have turned out for the worst. The largest casualty of the weekend is the men's commonsense. They don't hike out of the ravine, and instead finish their fishing weekend with some great catches. Then they head out and report the body. The town and the men's lives quickly turn into a mess. The local media swarms them, and accusations of aboriginal prejudices rear up from the local natives. Stewart's wife Claire (Laura Linney, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE) senses the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did, but has to battle with it through her own mental illness. Amidst all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle, splayed out on a morgue slab. Her murder and subsequent dumping into the water are symbolic of what lay beneath the town of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and outcast. The only other people who seem to understand some of what is going on are two young kids: Stewart and Claire's son who is being led around by a half-breed Aussie who's mother was killed also just a few years before. The young girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let go of her mother the best way she can, and the discovery of a new body seems  strangely enough  a method in which to accomplish this (again, the underlying current of Jindabyne is surmised). Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lurks beneath its surface, yet none of them are willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around (the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old town of Jindabyne under its surface). None, that is, until Claire forces them to. The movie is interesting if a bit too convoluted. There are far too many story lines that needed exploring and it just doesn't get done; too many loose threads. The acting was okay, but the filming was terrible. Wobbly cameras, grainy or dark shots, and just a generalized sloppiness hurt the overall production. I enjoy symbolic films, NORTHFORK being one of my all-time favorites in that vein.

To address the second part of the question, let me gather information on the recovery time for Adem disease. Step 1: Look for information on the recovery time for Adem disease from reliable sources, such as medical journals, research articles, and reputable websites. Step 2: Analyze the information found to determine whether \\"The average time to recover is one to six months\\" is a reasonable answer. According to my research, the recovery time for Adem disease indeed varies from person to person. In mild cases, individuals may experience significant improvement within a few weeks to several months. However, in more severe cases, the recovery process may take longer, or some symptoms may persist. The prognosis for recovery is generally favorable, with the majority of patients achieving partial or complete recovery.

CHAPTER VI  A GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK  There was a game of hide and seek that Danny Meadow Mouse once played with Buster Bear. It was a very dreadful game for Danny. But hard as it was for Danny, it didn't begin to be as hard as the game Lightfoot the Deer was playing with the hunter in the Green Forest.  In the case of Buster Bear and Danny, the latter had simply to keep out of reach of Buster. As long as Buster didn't get his great paws on Danny, the latter was safe. Then, too, Danny is a very small person. He is so small that he can hide under two or three leaves. Wherever he is, he is pretty sure to find a hiding-place of some sort. His small size gives him advantages in a game of hide and seek. It certainly does. But Lightfoot the Deer is big. He is one of the largest of the people who live in the Green Forest. Being so big, it is not easy to hide.  Moreover, a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close in order to kill. Lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the coming of the hunter of whom Sammy Jay had warned him. He had learned many lessons in the hunting season of the year before and he remembered every one of them. He knew that to forget even one of them might cost him his life.

Make use of the article to answer the questions. (CNN) -- Mohammad Idrissou put Cameroon on course for a spot in the African Nations Cup quarterfinals with a late winner in a topsy-turvy 3-2 Group D victory over Zambia.  Zambia bossed the first half and went ahead inside 10 minutes through Jacob Mulenga.  A terrible mistake from Zambia keeper Kennedy Mweene allowed Geremi to equalise and Samuel Eto'o gave Cameroon the lead in the 72nd minute.  Christopher Katongo thought he had earned a point with an 82nd-minute penalty but Idrissou had the last word for Cameroon just four minutes later.  The Indomitable Lions were looking to ignite their campaign after a shock 1-0 defeat by Gabon in their opening match, which was also a first loss for manager Paul Le Guen.  But it got worse for the four-time champions in only the eighth minute, and it was experienced center-back Rigobert Song who was the architect of his own side's downfall.  Felix Katongo swung in a great cross from the left and, in attempting to head behind, Song instead drew a point-blank save from his keeper. Carlos Kameni, though, could only push the ball out to Mulenga, who was left with a simple tap-in.  Zambia should have doubled their lead before half-time. Rainford Kalaba's fierce free-kick was pushed back into the danger area by Kameni but Christopher Katongo could not direct his shot away from the keeper.  And that was made to look very costly in the 68th minute when a calamitous mistake from Mweene saw Cameroon draw level.  Geremi sent in a hopeful cross from the right wing that the Zambia keeper inexplicably helped into his own net.  1. What team won in Group D? 2. What player helped them win? 3.

The violence occurred on Tuesday afternoon in Bachu county, Kashgar prefecture.      The foreign ministry said it had been a planned attack by a \\"violent terrorist group\\", but ethnic groups questioned this.      There have been sporadic clashes in Xinjiang in recent years.      The incidents come amid rumbling ethnic tensions between the Muslim Uighur and Han Chinese communities. In 2009 almost 200 people - mostly Han Chinese - were killed after deadly rioting erupted.      Analysis Nothing is stopping foreign journalists from booking flights to Xinjiang after hearing reports of violence there. However, simply travelling to the region doesn't guarantee the ability to dig out the truth behind this story. In 2009, dozens of foreign reporters were permitted to join an official tour of Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, after clashes between minority ethnic Uighur residents and majority Chinese Hans killed 197 people. Their experiences were mixed. Some reporters were able to speak to a variety of people on the ground, while others faced harassment and intimidation. The situation remains the same today. Reporters who travel to the area are closely followed by government minders. Locals often hesitate to answer questions, fearing reprisals from government authorities. Uighur exile groups often provide accounts that differ from the official Chinese government reports. Reconciling the two can be tricky. The situation isn't any easier for Chinese journalists. China's propaganda departments have warned domestic news outlets against conducting their own independent reporting on sensitive Xinjiang stories, ordering them to reprint official stories from China's major state news agencies.      It is very difficult to verify reports from Xinjiang, reports the BBC's Celia Hatton.      Foreign journalists are allowed to travel to the region but frequently face intimidation and harassment when attempting to verify news of ethnic rioting or organised violence against government authorities.      'Terrorism'      Hou Hanmin, director of the Xinjiang government's propaganda department, said Tuesday's clashes began as officials described as community workers searched homes for weapons.      She told the BBC's Chinese service that three of the workers were killed as they were investigating reports of suspicious individuals at the home of a local resident.      Unarmed police then arrived to investigate the workers' earlier reports and were attacked, said Ms Hou. Three \\"thugs\\" died and nine police officers were cornered in a house which was then set on fire, she said, calling the incident a \\"planned terrorist attack\\" on innocent victims.      There was no information on the identity of the assailants. Ten of the officials and police killed were ethnic Uighurs, the local authorities said.      Eight people were arrested.      Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said initial police investigations showed it had been \\"a premeditated attack carried out by a violent terrorist group\\".      She said the security situation in Xinjiang was \\"good in general, but a small cluster of terrorist forces are still doing their very best to upset and sabotage Xinjiang's stability and development\\".      \\"I believe their plan goes against the will of the people and is doomed to fail,\\" she told a news conference.      But Dilxat Raxit, a spokesperson for the World Uighur Congress, an umbrella organisation of Uighur groups, told the BBC the incident was caused by the killing of a young Uighur by Chinese \\"armed personnel\\" as a result of a government clean-up campaign.      Uighurs and Xinjiang Uighurs are ethnically Turkic Muslims      They make up about 45% of the region's population; 40% are Han Chinese      China re-established control in 1949 after crushing short-lived state of East Turkestan      Since then, large-scale immigration of Han Chinese      Uighurs fear erosion of traditional culture      Uighurs make up about 45% of the region's population, but say an influx of Han Chinese residents has marginalised their traditional culture.      Beijing authorities often blame violent incidents in Xinjiang on Uighur extremists seeking autonomy for the region. Uighur activists, meanwhile, accuse Beijing of over-exaggerating the threat to justify heavy-handed rule.      In March, 20 people were jailed on terrorism and separatism charges in the region. Last August courts jailed another 20 people on similar charges in Xinjiang. ||||| Twenty-one people, including police officers and social workers, have been killed in violent clashes in China's ethnically divided western region of Xinjiang in what the government is calling an act of terrorism.      Al Jazeera's Marga Ortigas said on Wednesday police were investigating an arson attack in the region where the violence began.      \\"The region has been the focal point for ethnic and racial tensions for quite some time now,\\" Ortigas said.      A local official confirmed to the AFP news agency on Wednesday that the battle had taken place.      \\"Twenty-one persons were killed in all... including social workers and policemen,\\" the official said.      He told the news agency that the violence broke out on Tuesday when three local officials reported a group of suspicious men armed with knives hiding inside a home in Selibuya township outside the city of Kashgar.      The death toll was the highest for a single incident in months in Xinjiang, which sees recurrent outbreaks of violence pitting Muslim minority Uyghurs against the authorities and majority ethnic Han Chinese migrants.      'Uyghur repression'      Tianshan Net, a government-run news website, described the fighting as a \\"violent terror incident\\".      It said 15 of those killed were either police or social workers, with 11 of them being members of China's Uyghur ethnic minority, who mainly live in Xinjiang.      Six \\"gang members\\" were shot dead in the violence, while eight more were captured, the report said.      The source who spoke to AFP confirmed the contents of the report, but said he did not know how many police were among the dead.      The incident points to the chaotic nature of much of the Xinjiang violence, as well as problems with how authorities respond.      Armed units are often stationed in larger towns and barracks and must be specially summoned by commanders before they can respond.      The Uyghurs have long alleged discrimination in China because of their culture, language and Muslim religion.      Last week, the US State Department released a report claiming \\"severe official repression of the freedoms of speech, religion, association, and harsh restrictions on the movement\\" of Uyghurs by the Chinese government.      Hua Chunying, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, said the case is still being investigated, but accused those involved for plotting \\"to carry out violent terrorist activities\\".      \\"China is a country ruled by the law,\\" said Hua. \\"Cracking down on crimes and ensuring the safety of citizens and their property is what the constitution and the law of China entitles the public security authorities to do\\". ||||| BEIJING (Reuters) - A confrontation involving axes, knives, at least one gun and ending with the burning down of a house left 21 people dead in China's troubled far-west region of Xinjiang, a government spokeswoman said on Wednesday, calling it a \\"terrorist attack\\".      Nine residents, six police and six ethnic Uighurs were killed in Tuesday's violence, said Hou Hanmin, spokeswoman for the Xinjiang government.      It was not immediately clear how many burnt to death.      Hou did not name any group, but China has blamed previous attacks in energy-rich Xinjiang - strategically located on the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Central Asia - on Islamic separatists who want to establish an independent East Turkestan.      Many Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim people native to Xinjiang, chafe at Chinese controls on their religion, language and culture.      Three \\"community workers\\" were patrolling a neighborhood of Bachu County, known as Maralbexi by Uighurs, in Kashgar after a tip-off that there were \\"suspicious people\\" in a private house, Hou said.      One of the three used a phone to call for help after they found a number of knives, resulting in their being killed by 14 Uighur \\"rioters\\" in the house, Hou said.      \\"The community people were just conducting regular checks, but the action from the rioters was planned and well prepared,\\" Hou said. \\"It's certainly a terrorist attack.\\"      Several police and other \\"community workers\\" came in different groups to the home where the Uighurs used axes and large knives to slash the police officers and workers, Hou said.      Only one police officer was armed with a gun, she said.      The battle ended with the gang members burning down the house, killing the rest of the people there, Hou said. Eight people had been detained.      Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the exiled World Uyghur Congress, said the violence was sparked by the shooting and killing of a young Uighur by \\"Chinese armed personnel\\", prompting the Uighurs to fight back.      \\"To suppress the fight among the Uighurs, China can engage in arbitrary shootings,\\" Raxit said in an emailed statement.      Some Chinese officials also blame such attacks on Muslim militants trained in Pakistan. But many rights groups say China overstates the threat to justify its tight grip on the region.      (Reporting by Sally Huang, Terril Yue Jones, Sui-Lee Wee and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Nick Macfie) ||||| China's western Xinjiang region has a long history of discord between China's authorities and the indigenous Uighur ethnic minority.      Who are the Uighurs?      Image copyright AFP      The Uighurs are Muslims. They regard themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations.      The region's economy has for centuries revolved around agriculture and trade, with towns such as Kashgar thriving as hubs along the famous Silk Road.      In the early part of the 20th Century, the Uighurs briefly declared independence. The region was brought under the complete control of communist China in 1949.      Xinjiang is officially designated an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south.      What are their grievances?      Image copyright AFP Image caption Beijing accuses exiled Uighurs including Rebiya Kadeer of whipping up trouble      Activists say central government policies have gradually curtailed the Uighurs' religious, commercial and cultural activities. Beijing is accused of intensifying a crackdown after street protests in Xinjiang in the 1990s, and again in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics in 2008.      Over the past decade, many prominent Uighurs have been imprisoned or have sought asylum abroad after being accused of terrorism. Mass immigration of Han Chinese to Xinjiang had made Uighurs a minority in Xinjiang.      Beijing is accused of exaggerating the threat from Uighur separatists in order to justify repression in the region.      What is the view from Beijing?      Image copyright AFP Image caption Beijing has poured investment into Xinjiang, but has also flooded the region with security personnel      China's central government says Uighur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest.      Since the 9/11 attacks in the US, China has increasingly portrayed its Uighur separatists as auxiliaries of al-Qaeda, saying they have received training in Afghanistan. Little evidence has been produced in support of these claims.      More than 20 Uighurs were captured by the US military after its invasion of Afghanistan. They were imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay for years without being charged with any offence and most have now been resettled elsewhere.      When was the last major outbreak of violence?      Image copyright AFP Image caption Uighur women protested in a bid to discover the fate of their loved ones      Almost 200 people died in ethnic riots in Urumqi, the administrative capital of Xinjiang, in July 2009. One of the sparks for the violence seems to have been the deaths of two Uighurs in clashes with Han Chinese at a factory thousands of miles away in southern China.      The authorities blame Xinjiang separatists based outside China for the unrest, and they singled out exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer, saying she incited the violence. She denied any responsibility for the violence.      Uighur exiles say police fired indiscriminately on peaceful protests, leading to violence and deaths.      What is the current situation in Xinjiang?      Image copyright AFP Image caption Xinjiang's reputation as an exotic outpost on the famed Silk Road still attracts Han Chinese tourists      Xinjiang has received huge state investment in industrial and energy projects, and Beijing has been keen to highlight these as major steps forward. But many Uighurs complain that the Han are taking their jobs, and that their farmland has been confiscated for redevelopment.      The activities of local and foreign journalists are closely monitored by the state and there are few independent sources of news from the region.      However, occasional attacks on Chinese targets suggest Uighur separatism remains a potent and potentially violent force. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"In China's Xinjiang region, there have been violent clashes that left 21 people dead, including 15 police officers and officials. The foreign ministry claimed this was a planned attack by a \\"violent terrorist group\\". Xinjiang has faced sporadic clashes in recent years due to ethnic tensions between the Muslim Uighur and Han Chinese communities.

Please write a short summary for the following article: An unexpected look into Cambodian rock before the killing fields “When we were young, we loved being modern,” an unseen female narrator says at the start of “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten: Cambodia’s Lost Rock & Roll,” the 2014 documentary film directed by John Pirozzi. The words are spoken in Khmer, Cambodia’s official language, and translated onscreen, accompanied by stark graphics and ominously rumbling music composed by Scot Stafford. “Then Pol Pot took over Phnom Penh in 1975,” the narrator continues. “I was a singer.” An old photograph of a lovely young woman, smiling and chic, materializes slowly, its sepia tone connoting faded memories. There is a surprise waiting in “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten,” a labor of love that Pirozzi painstakingly assembled over a span of close to a decade, although the story it tells holds no mystery. Anyone who knows the history of modern Cambodia — its peaceful liberation from French occupation in 1953, its rush to modernization under the culturally enlightened monarch Norodom Sihanouk, the incursion of the Vietnam War, and the blood-soaked rise to power of Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge regime, which exacted a horrific toll on intellectuals and artists in particular — will understand that Pirozzi’s topic is not the stuff of happy endings. photo from personal collection of Mol Kamach The band Baksey Cham Krong in the film “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten: Cambodia’s Lost Rock & Roll.” The surprise, then, is how much tangible evidence of a thriving, joyous Cambodian musical scene the director was able to retrieve and bring to light. Pirozzi, who became aware of Cambodian pop while working on Matt Dillon’s feature film “City of Ghosts” in 2001, pursued his subject with a detective’s resourcefulness and a music nerd’s gusto. In a previous documentary, “Sleepwalking Through the Mekong” (2007), he took the members of Dengue Fever, a Los Angeles band inspired by vintage Khmer pop, to Cambodia, the native land of its lead singer, Chhom Nimol, and tracked down some of the surviving artists of that era. Some of the biggest names in Cambodian pop, understandably, were no longer around to participate — in particular Sinn Sisamouth, a suave, prolific, and trend-setting singer who might be considered the Khmer Sinatra, and who is presumed to have died in the Killing Fields. But Pirozzi located and interviewed witnesses, scholars, and a key handful of musicians, such as Sieng Vanthy. Hers, it turns out, are the voice and the image that open the film. In a gripping interview, Vanthy, who died in 2009, reveals that she’d survived an encounter with the Khmer Rouge by claiming to be a banana merchant. Through miraculously preserved film footage, as well as old photographs and album covers, we are introduced to a lively, swinging milieu that suits perfectly Cambodia’s embrace of all things modern in the ’50s. Its participants — artists and listeners alike — are young and happy, their adoption of French and English styles, Latin American influences, and American appropriations adept and joyous. Viewers will delight in discovering acts like the twangy Baksey Cham Krong, Cambodia’s eminent surf-guitar combo, and the heavier, funkier Drakkar — both of which have reunited to reap unexpected benefits provided by screenings of Pirozzi’s film. The music, the stuff of cultish collectors for decades, is thrilling. And although there is genuine horror in the way that many of these luminaries were cast into shadow, prematurely and brutally, there remains a certain triumph to be had in Pirozzi’s film. It offers confirmation, if not exactly consolation, that brighter efforts of the human spirit can sometimes persevere. • ‘The Look of Silence’ revisits the 1965 Indonesian genocide • Following the path of justice in Florida in ‘3½ Minutes, Ten Bullets’ • In ‘The Tribe,’ a school for the deaf becomes the world Summary:","output":"\\"Don't Think I've Forgotten: Cambodia's Lost Rock & Roll\\" is a 2014 documentary film directed by John Pirozzi that explores the vibrant Cambodian musical scene prior to Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime.

Article: On December 8, 1991, at Viskuli near Brest (Belarus), the President of the Russian SFSR and the heads of Byelorussian SSR and Ukrainian SSR signed the \\"Agreement on the Establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States\\" (known in media as Belavezha Accords). The document, consisting of a preamble and fourteen articles, stated that the Soviet Union ceased to exist as a subject of international law and geopolitical reality. However, based on the historical community of peoples, relations between them, given the bilateral treaties, the desire for a democratic rule of law, the intention to develop their relations based on mutual recognition and respect for state sovereignty, the parties agreed to the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. On December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR by an overwhelming majority: 188 votes for, 6 against, 7 abstentions. On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR denounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and recalled all Russian deputies from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The legality of this act is the subject of discussions because, according to the 1978 Constitution (Basic Law) of the Russian SFSR, the Russian Supreme Soviet had no right to do so. However, by this time the Soviet government had been rendered more or less impotent, and was in no position to object. Although the December 12 vote is sometimes reckoned as the moment that the RSFSR seceded from the collapsing Soviet Union, this is not the case. It appears that the RSFSR took the line that it was not possible to secede from an entity that no longer existed. Question: What body ratified the Belavezha Accords on December 12?","output":"The Belavezha Accords were ratified on December 12, 1991, by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR (Soviet Federative Socialist Republic), which was the legislative body of the Russian SFSR. The ratification received an overwhelming majority of 188 votes in favor, 6 against, and 7 abstentions. This event marked a significant step in the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the fact that:  When we add resistors in parallel to each other the total resistance decreases and the current increases.  Answer the question:   If current increases, that means resistance is increasing or decreasing? The answer to this question is:","output":"When current increases, that means resistance is decreasing. Here's the step-by-step explanation and justification: 1. Ohm's Law states that Voltage (V) is equal to the product of Current (I) and Resistance (R), which is V = IR. 2. When resistors are added in parallel, the total resistance (R_total) decreases. This occurs because the inverse of the total resistance is equal to the sum of the inverses of each individual resistance: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn. Consequently, R_total will always be less than the smallest individual resistance in the parallel circuit. 3. With a constant voltage, as R_total decreases, according to Ohm's Law (V = IR), the current (I) must increase to maintain the same voltage across the circuit.  4. So when the current increases in a parallel circuit, it's a result of the total resistance decreasing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In the study, women who were new mothers scored better on tests of visuospatial memory - the ability to understand and remember information about their surroundings--compared with women who didn't have children. The findings contradicts the old belief that women develop\\"baby brain\\" or a decline in memory and cognitive  function, after they have kids, said study researcher Melissa Santiago, a doctoral student at Carlos Albizu University in Miami. \\"You don't have to feel that because you have kids, your memory isn't the same,\\" Santiago said. The study was small, and the findings will have to be tested in larger groups of people, Santiago said. Previous studies on the topic have had mixed results--some showed motherhood hurts cognition, and others showed the opposite. Studies on rats show those with pups have better memory than those without offspring. Santiago analyzed information from 35 first-time mothers whose children were ages 10 to 24 months, and 35 women who had never been pregnant. Both groups scored similarly on intelligence tests. The average age of mothers was 29 and the average age of never-pregnant women was 27. To test visuospatial memory, the women were shown a paper containing six symbols for 10 seconds, and then asked to draw what they remembered. This task was repeated several times. The first time women were shown the paper, both groups remembered about the same amount. But on the second and third pass, mothers performed better than those without children, indicating that the mothers collected more information each time than the other women. Later, the women were shown a variety of different symbols, and asked to remember which ones were presented on the earlier task. Mothers did not make a mistake in this task--they remembered every symbol correctly--but those without children made one or two errors, Santiago said. Which of the following was discussed in the text? A) Ways to test visuospatial memory. B) Why having kids improves memory. C) How young mothers are different from   never-pregnant women. D) The negative effects that worries of   women without children have. Answer:","output":"A) Ways to test visuospatial memory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Juventus midfielder left Old Trafford in 2012 because of a lack of first-team opportunities, but he could become the centrepiece of Jose Mourinho's new-look United side. Pogba's talent has been evident for years. That was why United signed him from Le Havre in 2009, when he had already captained France's Under-16 team. He was the same lithe, energetic athlete he is today, if somewhat more gangly. What he has done, according to knowledgeable sources, is apply himself and work at his game. Now 23, he still has a tendency to float in and out of matches - he was not a consistent performer at Euro 2016 and did not appear to relish the deeper role he was given by coach Didier Deschamps when France lost to Portugal in the final. But he has developed a greater understanding of his game and, with that mental maturity, more awareness of his positional responsibilities to the team as a whole. In his first spell at United, he would be walked through specific situations to improve his game management, or be taken to senior matches and told to watch individual players rather than the game itself. This experience has been put to good use. Under 21 football in England may be derided, but occasional outings alongside senior players also helped his education. Pogba is not the finished article. But the promise United first identified seven years ago is showing positive signs of being fulfilled, more than enough to persuade the club to potentially pay such a massive fee. Pogba made three substitute appearances for Manchester United in the Premier League, before joining Juventus for the 2012-13 season. Pogba was brought to the club as a 16-year-old boy, deemed good enough to play a central role in an FA Youth Cup final triumph in 2011, but was allowed to leave for an overseas rival, before being bought back for a world record fee four years later. Was it a mistake of gargantuan proportions or the consequence of a couple of isolated events combining to produce a very expensive outcome? Sir Alex Ferguson wanted to keep Pogba in 2012. Still only 19 at the time, Pogba and his agent Mino Raiola were made a contract offer and rejected it, meaning that all Juventus had to pay was a compensation fee of £1.5m for the teenager. Raiola believed Pogba should have been in the first team and on first-team wages. Ferguson felt he was still too raw to feature on a regular basis. It can't have helped that Ferguson and Raiola were like \\"oil and water\\", in the Scot's own words. The pivotal decision came when Paul Scholes, at the age of 37, reversed his retirement decision in January 2012. Scholes played 21 times in that half-season - and a further 21 in the campaign that followed. United were denied the title by Sergio Aguero's injury-time goal for Manchester City against QPR on the final day in 2012. They won it in 2013 - after which Scholes retired for good - but have not challenged since. There is no way of knowing what would have happened if Scholes had stayed retired and Pogba had played those games instead. It is just as impossible to assess whether the young midfielder would have developed at the same rate in England as he has done at Juventus, with whom he has won four successive Serie A titles. And had he remained at United, would Pogba now be looking to leave - just as Cristiano Ronaldo did for Real Madrid as he entered his prime? One thing is for sure: ignoring a player you need, just because you had him once and let him go, would be cutting off your nose to spite your face. Media playback is not supported on this device It is tempting to say that if a club spend going on for £100m on a player, the system fits around him, not the other way around. Football is not quite so straightforward, though. Even the best players can struggle without a structure - or if they are played out of position. It is still a source of bewilderment to staff at United as to why Angel di Maria - their previous record signing at £59.7m - was used as a holding midfield player by former manager Louis van Gaal. Di Maria, it is worth remembering, began his Old Trafford career with three goals and three assists in his first five Premier League appearances from the offensive position he was so effective in for Real Madrid. Pogba is a rarity in the modern game in that he is capable of both attack and defence. He is quick, has stamina and can tackle. Though not a prolific scorer, his average of one goal every five games suggests he is an attacking threat. And while his average of one yellow card in every four games would put him under threat of suspension if repeated in England, he was not sent off last season. In short, he is the kind of player United have lacked since Roy Keane left in 2005 - without the red cards. Mourinho will surely stick him in the centre of his midfield and work from there. In his recent interview with the BBC, Mourinho said he did not understand why there was such uncertainty over Wayne Rooney, who was \\"the club captain, the players' captain and my captain\\". However, there are many reasons why there are doubts about Rooney's future role at United. Including transfer fees and wages over the respective periods of their contracts, Mourinho - when the Pogba deal is complete - has committed £250m on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and the Frenchman. A front-line striker, a creative offensive player and a dominant midfielder are three of the four fundamentals Mourinho identified as needing urgent attention when he replaced Van Gaal. At various points in his United career, Rooney has filled all these roles. In noting United's deficiencies and by addressing them in such a calculated manner, it is a fair assumption Mourinho intends to utilise his new additions, particularly in the biggest games. Rooney, for all his many attributes, is no speed merchant. Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Memphis Depay definitely are, making them better suited to wide positions. If the plan is to play Mkhitaryan wide, or deeper, in midfield, there is an obvious space for Rooney at number 10. But is that going to get the best from the Armenian? Mourinho likes his central midfield to contain aggressive, athletic players, such as Claude Makelele and Michael Essien from his first stint at Chelsea. Pogba is in that mould. Morgan Schneiderlin and Daley Blind could work effectively alongside him. If that happens, the uncertainty over Rooney will persist. Media playback is not supported on this device The manager who says he is truly happy with his squad, that he has the best player possible for any position and could not countenance spending a little bit more, has not been invented yet. Mourinho himself has said he would act \\"if something presents itself before 31 August\\". What it is safe to say is that he won't be spending any more money without recouping some. Even accounting for the demands of six pre-Christmas games in the Europa League, United's squad is too bulky as it is. Yet standards at Old Trafford have slipped so much since Ferguson's departure three years ago that it is hard to argue the issues have been rectified completely by Mourinho's four \\"fundamental\\" signings, which go straight through the spine of his team. For instance, 12 months ago, United were engaged in a concerted attempt to get central defender Sergio Ramos out of Real Madrid. It did not happen and Van Gaal did not recruit anyone else. In 23-year-old Ivory Coast defender Eric Bailly, who has played only 40 La Liga games, have United really strengthened their defence to Mourinho's satisfaction? So who might go to create space? German World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger and Belgian wide man Adnan Januzaj evidently have no future at Old Trafford. The same is also true of Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair, two of the youngsters Van Gaal took pride in promoting. Of the 23 outfield players Mourinho is prepared to base United's season around, Marcos Rojo's alarming impetuosity identifies him as one potential candidate. Antonio Valencia continues to give the impression of being a winger trying to play full-back, rather than someone sure of his surroundings. Schneiderlin, Matteo Darmian and Depay were all massive disappointments in their first United campaigns. It is generally unwise to form concrete opinions on a single season, particularly on players coming to England for the first time - as it is solely on performances in a major tournament. Nevertheless, none of that trio can be sure of themselves. Ander Herrera is yet to show sustained form. And what of Juan Mata? The incredibly popular Spain midfielder, who United spent £37.1m on halfway through David Moyes' short tenure, was sold by Mourinho during his second spell at Chelsea. That the questions and doubts are so numerous come as a direct result of both United's fifth-place finish last season and the various awful performances that contributed to it. Until they wake from their post-Ferguson slumber, the forensic analysis of United and their players will go on.","output":"Juventus midfielder, Paul Pogba, may become the centrepiece of Jose Mourinho's new Manchester United side if he returns to Old Trafford after leaving in 2012."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which language is this?","output":"The text presented is in Finnish, a Finno-Ugric language primarily spoken in Finland and by minority groups in neighboring countries. Finnish is a complex language that has many unique attributes. For starters, it is part of the Finno-Ugric group of languages, which primarily exist in Finland, Hungary, and certain areas of Russia. Therefore, it has no direct linguistic roots with many other European languages. The language is defined by its particular use of inflections. For example, Finnish uses extensive modifiers to denote the role of a noun within a sentence, rather than relying on prepositions. This may make it seem quite complicated for non-Finnish speakers. However, like any language, it becomes easier to understand with practice. Finnish is also notable for its unique phonetic structure. It has double vowels and consonants, which are distinct sounds that should not be blended together, leading to a melodic quality. The tone or 'melody' of Finnish is a notable characteristic and it falls to the rhythm of trochaic tetrameter, which is popular in Finnish poetry. Another interesting point about Finnish is that it has no gender pronouns, and it uses the singular pronoun - 'hän' - to signify both 'he' and 'she'. This characteristic often leads those studying gender and language neutrality to cite Finnish as a prime example. The language used in legal, political or administrative matters, such as the extract you have provided, is a standardized form of Finnish known as \\"yleiskieli\\". This form is used uniformly across the country regardless of local dialects and it is taught in schools to maintain consistency in communications.  Despite Finland's relatively small population, Finnish has a high rate of speakers, with about 90% of Finland's population considering it their first language. The rest of the population primarily speaks Swedish, which is Finland's second official language due to historical and political relationships between Finland and Sweden.  In summary, the language of the text provided is Finnish - a unique and fascinating language characterized by complex inflections, unique phonetics, and a level of gender neutrality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After her mother was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, Julia Wilkerson lovingly cared for her. But after six years, the strain on the former county golf champion became too much – and she hit the 71-year-old over the head with a broom. It happened during an argument while they were clearing out the garage at their £250,000 detached, four-bedroom home. Sportswoman Julia Wilkerson, 40, lashed out after caring for her 71-year-old mother. The blow left Clover Wilkerson. bleeding and led to her daughter, a former team captain of the Norfolk. Ladies County Golf Association and five times winner of the Norfolk. county championships, facing prosecution for assault. The pair’s ‘loving relationship’ broke. down as Wilkerson, 40, struggled to cope under the immense strain of. being a carer, King’s Lynn magistrates’ court was told. She had fallen into a ‘cycle of. resentment and guilt’ and feared her life was no longer her own. Yvonne. Neil, prosecuting, said Wilkerson’s mother admitted slapping her. daughter on the back first during the argument in the garage. That led to Wilkerson hitting her mother with the broom, which was an ‘entirely disproportionate’ reaction, the lawyer added. Ian Graham, defending, said it was an ‘unfortunate case of two people who clearly love each other’. Wilkerson, a former team captain of Norfolk Ladies County Golf Association and five-time winner of Norfolk county championships, found herself hauled into court. ‘The relationship has got into. difficulty,’ he said. ‘Julia has siblings but she was the person who. decided to take on the very serious responsibility of becoming her. carer. It appears to have got too much for her.’ Mr Graham said Wilkerson was someone. with previous good  character who had got into a  ‘difficult situation’ with her mother but it was hoped the two would now be able to reconcile. their differences. Wilkerson, of King’s Lynn,  Norfolk,. was given a 12-month  conditional discharge after magistrates were given. character references showing her to be a ‘very caring person’. Presiding magistrate Jill Skinner said: ‘Both you and your mother are probably very upset by the whole thing.’ Wilkerson, who had denied a charge of. assault by beating at a previous hearing, was also ordered to pay £100. costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Police yesterday confirmed that. Wilkerson’s mother complained about her daughter on the day of the. attack, October 5 last year, which led to her arrest. Wilkerson was living with her mother at the time. Speaking at the house yesterday, her. mother said: ‘My daughter does not live here any more and it was part of. her bail conditions. ‘She works at a health centre but I. don’t want to make any further comment.’ Mrs Wilkerson lives a mile away. from her former husband Albert, who is remarried, and son Paul, 35. Neither was available to comment yesterday. Barbara Williams, director of research. and support charity  Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘Parkinson’s is an incurable. condition that progresses over time, and caring for someone with. Parkinson’s can have a profound effect on mental and physical wellbeing. ‘It’s very common for carers to feel. stressed, fatigued and have difficulty sleeping but very often they. don’t prioritise their own care, missing doctor’s appointments and. putting off getting help. ‘Nonetheless they have the  courage to keep going, and the  support carers contribute is invaluable.’ She urged carers in need of support. themselves to contact the charity’s support workers and groups to ‘help. take the pressure out of the pressure cooker’.

Write an article based on this summary: – Authorities aren't giving up the search for 500 million in paintings stolen in one of the largest art thefts in US history. On Monday, the FBI searched the property of an 80-year-old mobster linked to the 1990 theft of 13 paintings—including three Rembrandts, a Vermeer, and a Manet—from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, reports the Boston Globe. A lawyer for Robert Gentile says agents searched in and around his home in Manchester, Conn., using metal detectors and dogs. At one point, they were seen digging within 10 feet of the house after removing siding and a vent pipe reportedly leading to an underground oil tank, per the Hartford Courant. But \\"they ain't gonna find nothing,\\" Gentile told his lawyer, adding he didn't steal the paintings, isn't hiding them, and has no idea where they are. Two previous searches of the property turned up nothing, though federal prosecutors say Gentile offered to sell two of the stolen paintings to an undercover FBI agent for 500,000 each in 2015, reports NBC Connecticut. He also offered to return the paintings in exchange for a lesser sentence for a friend and told at least three people that he had access to the art, prosecutors say. Agents don't believe Gentile actually took part in the theft—those two men are dead, according to the FBI—but the wife of a suspect told police that her husband gave Gentile two paintings before his death in 2004. Gentile is now serving a 2.5-year prison sentence for drug and gun charges after an arrest last year, per ABC News. The Gardner Museum, meanwhile, is offering 5 million for information leading to the recovery of the masterworks.

Monday witnessed the FBI searching the property of 80-year-old mobster Robert Gentile, who has been linked to the theft. Background on the Theft: 13 valuable paintings were stolen in the 1990 heist, with works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Manet among them. The loss to the art world and the museum has not been forgotten, and the authorities remain determined to recover the stolen masterpieces. The Gardner Museum is currently offering a 5 million reward for information that leads to the successful recovery of the paintings. FBI searches Gentile's Property: With information on possible links between the notorious theft and mobster Robert Gentile, the FBI conducted a search of Gentile's home in Manchester, Connecticut. According to the Boston Globe, agents used metal detectors and dogs to scour the area, at one point digging within 10 feet of the house after removing siding and a vent pipe that led to an underground oil tank, as reported by the Hartford Courant. Gentile's Denial: Despite two previous unsuccessful searches of the property, Gentile's lawyer states that his client denies stealing the paintings, hiding them, or even knowing where they are. Gentile told his lawyer, \\"they ain't gonna find nothing.\\" Prior Incidents: However, federal prosecutors have revealed that Gentile attempted to sell two of the stolen paintings for 500,000 each to an undercover FBI agent in 2015, as reported by NBC Connecticut. Furthermore, Gentile reportedly offered to return the paintings if a friend's sentence could be reduced, and claimed to have access to the stolen artwork in conversations with at least three people.  Current Situation: Although the FBI does not believe Gentile personally participated in the theft, the wife of a suspect told police that her husband gave Gentile two paintings before he died in 2004. Gentile is currently serving a 2.5-year prison sentence for unrelated drug and gun charges after being arrested last year, according to ABC News. Conclusion: Despite authorities not giving up on the search for the stolen artwork, and with the Gardner Museum offering a substantial reward, there is still no resolution to the case. The FBI's ongoing investigation of Robert Gentile's property demonstrates their continued efforts to locate and recover the missing masterpieces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Scraping oneself on an object that is what, may cause an invasion of the body by bacteria?\\" given the options provided, is \\"contaminated\\". This selection is the most accurate and fitting response given the context and provided knowledge that scraping oneself on a contaminated object may cause an infection, and an infection is, in essence, an invasion of the body by bacteria. To understand why 'contaminated' is the best choice, let's delve into each option: - 'Unknown': This doesn't convey enough information about the object's state that would cause a bacterial invasion following a scrape.  - 'Safe': This would imply the object is harmless, which contradicts with causing a bacterial invasion. - 'Threatened': This characterizes the object as being in danger, but does not suggest it could bring harm to a person who scrapes against it. - 'Harmful substances': While this option implies danger, it does not specify if the harm is related to bacteria. - 'Pollution': This term describes something that is unwanted and harmful. While pollution may contain bacteria, not all pollution does, making the term too broad for the specific situation of causing a bacterial invasion. - 'Foreign': Again, this word describes something originating from outside or alien to the body, but it's not necessarily harmful or infection-causing. - 'Barrel-shaped': This is irrelevant as it describes a physical form, and not the state, of the object which would lead to a bacterial invasion. - 'Contaminated': This term directly suggests the presence of harmful or undesired elements including bacteria.    In conclusion, the term 'contaminated', referring to an object carrying bacteria or other impurities, clearly poses a risk of infection or bacterial invasion when someone scrapes themselves against it. Hence, 'contaminated' is the most appropriate answer among the given options."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Who confronts Kirk about Spock's death? Movie title: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Movie plot: The Federation Starship Enterprise returns to Earth following a battle with the superhuman Khan Noonien Singh, who tried to destroy the Enterprise by detonating an experimental terraforming device known as Genesis. The casualties of the fight include Admiral James T. Kirk's Vulcan friend, Spock, whose casket was launched into space and eventually landed on the planet created by the Genesis Device. On arriving at Earth Spacedock, Doctor Leonard McCoy begins to act strangely and is detained. Starfleet Admiral Morrow visits the Enterprise and informs the crew the ship is to be decommissioned; the crew is ordered not to speak about Genesis due to political fallout over the device. David Marcus (Merritt Butrick)âKirk's son, a key scientist in Genesis's developmentâand Lieutenant Saavik (Robin Curtis) are investigating the Genesis planet on board the science vessel Grissom. Discovering an unexpected life form on the surface, Marcus and Saavik transport to the planet. They find that the Genesis Device has resurrected Spock in the form of a child, although his mind is not present. Marcus admits that he used unstable \\"protomatter\\" in the development of the Genesis Device, causing Spock to age rapidly and meaning the planet will be destroyed within hours. Meanwhile, Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), the commander of a Klingon vessel, intercepts information about Genesis. Believing the device to be potentially useful as a weapon, he takes his cloaked ship to the Genesis planet, destroys the Grissom, and takes hostage Marcus, Saavik, and Spock. Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), confronts Kirk about his son's death. The pair learn that before he died, Spock transferred his katra, or living spirit, to McCoy. Spock's katra and body are needed to lay him to rest on his homeworld, Vulcan, and without help, McCoy will die from carrying the katra.

My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance. We had written our own vows, in fact, our own ceremony, including our own rituals. And yes, I cried, because I was / am so in love with my bride.

Under 100 words is a good title length. Q: Background: Prevention of infection with airborne pathogens and exposure to airborne particulates and aerosols (environmental pollutants and allergens) can be facilitated through use of disposable face masks. The effectiveness of such masks for excluding pathogens and pollutants is dependent on the intrinsic ability of the masks to resist penetration by airborne contaminants. This study evaluated the relative contributions of a mask, valve, and Micro Ventilator on aerosol filtration efficiency of a new N95 respiratory face mask. Methods: The test mask was challenged, using standardized methods, with influenza A and rhinovirus type 14, bacteriophage ΦΧ174, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and model pollutants. The statistical significance of results obtained for different challenge microbial agents and for different mask configurations (masks with operational or nonoperational ventilation fans and masks with sealed Smart Valves) was assessed. Results: The results demonstrate >99.7% efficiency of each test mask configuration for exclusion of influenza A virus, rhinovirus 14, and S. aureus and >99.3% efficiency for paraffin oil and sodium chloride (surrogates for PM 2.5 ). Statistically significant differences in effectiveness of the different mask configurations were not identified. The efficiencies of the masks for excluding smaller-size (i.e., rhinovirus and bacteriophage ΦΧ174) vs. larger-size microbial agents (influenza virus, S. aureus) were not significantly different. Conclusions: The masks, with or without features intended for enhancing comfort, provide protection against both small-and large-size pathogens. Importantly, the mask appears to be highly efficient for filtration of pathogens, including influenza and rhinoviruses, as well as the fine particulates (PM 2.5 ) present in aerosols that represent a greater challenge for many types of dental and surgical masks. This renders this individual-use N95 respiratory mask an improvement over the former types of masks for protection against a variety of environmental contaminants including PM 2.5 and pathogens such as influenza and rhinoviruses.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: Dr. Joost Vander Auwera (born 24 January 1957) is a Belgian art historian and museum curator. He is Senior Curator at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. He is the Co-Founder and Project Leader of the international multidisciplinary Jordaens Van Dyck Panel Paintings Project and the Project Leader for the establishment of the visitors centre at the Brueghel House, Brussels. Hypothesis: Dr. Joost Vander Auwera lives in Brussels.","output":"We can reasonably draw the hypothesis that Dr. Joost Vander Auwera lives in Brussels from the context provided. Here is a detailed breakdown of how we can come to this hypothesis: 1. Dr. Joost Vander Auwera is a Belgian art historian and museum curator, which establishes his professional background and connection to Belgium. 2. He is the Senior Curator at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. This implies that his primary place of work is in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. It is common for people to live relatively close to their workplaces for practical reasons such as minimizing daily commuting time and optimizing work-life balance. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is a high possibility he resides in Brussels. 3. Dr. Vander Auwera is also the Project Leader for the establishment of the visitors center at the Brueghel House, Brussels. This further strengthens the connection between his professional activities and the city of Brussels. Taking up a leadership role in such a project usually demands time, commitment, and accessibility to the site, suggesting that he may live in Brussels to conveniently fulfill these obligations. 4. As the Co-Founder and Project Leader of the international multidisciplinary Jordaens Van Dyck Panel Paintings Project, Dr. Vander Auwera's professional interests align with the cultural and artistic scene in Brussels, making it more likely for him to reside in the city with rich artistic heritage. It is important to mention that the hypothesis, despite being based on the context provided and some reasonable assumptions, cannot be stated as a certainty without explicit confirmation or more concrete information about the exact location of Dr. Vander Auwera's residency. However, it is plausible and highly likely based on his professional associations and engagements with Brussels."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hilltop Hoods are an Australian hip hop group that formed in 1994 in Blackwood, Adelaide, South Australia. The group was founded by Suffa (Matthew David Lambert) and MC Pressure (Daniel Howe Smith), who were joined by DJ Debris (Barry John M. Francis) after fellow founder, DJ Next (Ben John Hare), left in 1999. The group released its first extended play, Back Two of Hilltop Hoods' founders first met in 1987 when MC Suffa (aka Matthew David Lambert) and MC Pressure (Daniel Howe Smith) attended Blackwood High School in Eden Hills - a suburb of Adelaide. In 1991 they joined up with DJ Next (Ben John Hare) through a mutual friend and formed an Australian hip hop group. Their name was supplied by fellow local MC Flak (from Cross Bred Mongrels) - the suburb of Blackwood is known by locals as the Hilltop. The band's influences include American hip hop artists: Notorious B.I.G., KRS-One, Gang Starr, Wu-Tang Clan and Public Enemy.  At live shows Next was the group's DJ, for recording he contributed audio engineering and all the scratching/turntablism on their early works. He regularly competed in the local DMC World DJ Championships (DMC) tournaments, winning the South Australian DMC championships multiple times. Hilltop Hoods recorded a demo, Highlanders, which was released on cassette tape only. As well as Pressure and Suffa on vocals, the group included MC Summit aka DJ Sum-1, but he did not appear on later Hilltop Hoods work.  The group's first official release, in 1997, was a vinyl-only, seven-track extended play, Back Once Again. Production was handled by DJ Debris (Barry John M Francis), turntablism and audio engineering by Next, vocals by Pressure and Suffa. The third track, \\"Shades of Grey\\", features Debris with a verse, and was co-written by Francis, Hare, Lambert and Smith. Fifth track, \\"Mankind Must Suffa\\" also features a guest verse from Quromystix (aka Quro, Andrew Michael Bradley) - a member of Finger Lickin' Good and later the Fuglemen. \\"Mankind Must Suffa\\" is credited to Lambert, Smith, Francis and Bradley. Back Once Again is out of print and unavailable for retail purchase.  The group's debut studio album, A Matter of Time, was released in 1999 on CD only. As with Back Once Again, it is now unavailable for retail purchase. All scratching/turntablism is performed by Next, a track, \\"Let Me Show You\\", has no vocals - solely showcasing his turntable skills. American MC Bukue One (Tion Torrence) appears for a guest verse on \\"Deaf Can Hear\\". The track is credited to Lambert, Smith, Francis, Hare and Torrence. The album was released independently but with financial assistance from Arts SA - the band were inspired, in 2005, to set up their own Hilltop Hoods Initiative, to help local artists. After the album appeared, Next left the group and moved to Melbourne. In 2004 he moved to London. In 1999 Debris, who was also a member of the Cross Bred Mongrels, replaced Next and became the Hilltop Hoods' full-time DJ.  Hilltop Hoods founded the Certified Wise Crew - a hip hop collaborative - with local groups Terra Firma, Cross Bred Mongrels and After Hours. Certified Wise Crew has since expanded to include MCs Trauma, Blockade, Kolaps, Flea, with Vents and Funkoars joining in later years. Hilltop Hoods received two nominations for the Hip Hop Act of the Year Award at the Australian Dance Music Awards and again at the 3D World Music Awards in 2001 and 2002. In 2001 the group's second album, Left Foot, Right Foot, was released with Lambert, Francis and M. Veraquth producing.

Plot title: Mike Bassett: England Manager Movie plot: The film starts with Mike Bassett (Tomlinson) winning a trophy with Norwich City. During the open top bus party, the bus takes a wrong turning and the team have to endure a very cold, lengthly detour up the A11.After the opening titles, the news comes in that England manager Phil Cope has had a heart attack, and a meeting takes place in which the members of the Football Association board must find a new manager to take them into the World Cup finals in Brazil. They are faced with problems in that the most successful Premier League manager is Scottish, the second most successful is too much of a \\"bigmouth\\" for the F.A.'s liking despite otherwise seeming perfect for the role, and all the other English managers in the Premier League come up with an increasingly ridiculous set of excuses to turn down the job. Still wanting to appoint an English manager, they look to the league below, Division One.As the press gather at Mike's house, he has no idea that they are there and unwittingly reveals himself (in polite terms) to them. As he speaks to them and says that he is not the England manager, his son Jason appears saying \\"Dad, you've got the England job.\\" Despite some recent bad results that caused the press to turn aggressively on Phil Cope, England are still theoretically in a strong position to qualify, and can make sure of it with either a single victory or avoiding defeat in their three remaining games.At his first meeting at Lancaster Gate (the home of English football) he is informed that he is allowed to pick his own assistant and coach.

First question: Is a brown discharge during your first period normal? Second question: Why is the very first period a brown discharge? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: Is a brown discharge during your first period normal? Yes, a brown discharge during your first period is normal and nothing to be worried about. The color of the menstrual blood may vary from bright red to brown, and it can sometimes have a darker, even black, appearance. The reason for this brown coloration is due to the presence of oxidized blood and endometrial tissue, which makes the blood appear older and darker. It is common for women and girls, especially during their first menstrual period called menarche, to notice a brown discharge. Menstrual blood may look different at various times in your cycle, and each individual's period is unique. Factors such as hormonal changes, the length of your menstrual cycle, and the heaviness of menstrual flow may influence the color of the menstrual blood. Brown discharge during the first period is not a cause for concern unless it is accompanied by a foul smell, severe pain, or abnormal bleeding patterns. Second question: Why is the very first period a brown discharge? The very first period often appears as a brown discharge because it is typically lighter and less heavy compared to periods later in life. This initial period, known as menarche, marks the beginning of a girl's menstrual cycle and fertility. During menarche, the body is undergoing hormonal changes and the reproductive system is still developing, which might result in a lighter bleeding. As a result, the menstrual blood spends more time within the uterus and vaginal canal, giving it more time to oxidize and turn brown. Also, the first period sometimes consists of not only fresh blood but also remnants of the endometrial lining, which contributes to a brownish coloration. As your body adjusts to the new hormonal changes and establishes a regular menstrual cycle, later periods may become heavier and appear in a brighter red color. Are these two questions asking the same thing? While these two questions are related, they are not asking exactly the same thing. The first question is inquiring whether a brown discharge during your first period is normal, focusing on reassurance and whether there is any cause for concern. The answer to this question provides the necessary context and reassurance that it is a normal occurrence for many women. The second question is asking for an explanation of why the very first period is a brown discharge, seeking more information on the underlying reasons for the brown coloration during menarche. The answer to this question delves into the causes behind the appearance of the brown discharge during the first period, including hormonal changes and the nature of the initial menstrual cycle. In summary, while the two questions are closely related and may often be discussed together, they are not identical inquiries. The first question focuses on the normalcy of brown discharge during the first period, whereas the second question aims to identify and understand the reasons behind this phenomenon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer based on context: There is some disagreement on which country has the largest proven gas reserves. Sources that consider that Russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the US CIA (47 600 km³), the US Energy Information Administration (47 800 km³), and OPEC (48 700 km³). However, BP credits Russia with only 32 900 km³, which would place it in second place, slightly behind Iran (33 100 to 33 800 km³, depending on the source).  With Gazprom, Russia is frequently the worlds largest natural gas extractor. Major proven resources (in cubic kilometers) are world 187 300 (2013), Iran 33 600 (2013), Russia 32 900 (2013), Qatar 25 100 (2013), Turkmenistan 17 500 (2013) and the United States 8500 (2013). What are all the countries in 2013 that are major natural gas extractors?","output":"In 2013, several countries were major natural gas extractors, contributing significantly to the global supply of natural gas. Here is a list of these countries along with their proven reserves in cubic kilometers, as mentioned in the context provided: 1. Iran: With proven reserves of approximately 33,600 km³ in 2013, Iran was one of the leading natural gas extractors. Iran's South Pars gas field is one of the largest in the world, contributing a significant portion of the country's natural gas production. 2. Russia: The country held proven reserves of about 32,900 km³ in 2013 and was a major player in the global natural gas market. Russia's gas production primarily came from major fields like Urengoy, Yamburg, and Bovanenko. 3. Qatar: In 2013, Qatar had proven natural gas reserves of approximately 25,100 km³. Qatar is known for its vast North Field, which is the largest non-associated gas field globally. 4. Turkmenistan: The Central Asian nation possessed approximately 17,500 km³ of proven natural gas reserves in 2013. With major fields like Galkynysh and South Yoloten, Turkmenistan played a key role in natural gas extraction in the region. 5. United States: Holding around 8,500 km³ of proven natural gas reserves in 2013, the United States was another major extractor. The US saw a significant increase in natural gas production during this time, primarily due to the rise in shale gas extraction through hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. In addition to these, other major natural gas extracting countries in 2013 included: 6. Saudi Arabia: With proven reserves of over 7,000 km³, Saudi Arabia was also a major natural gas producer. 7. United Arab Emirates (UAE): With around 6,000 km³ of proven reserves, the UAE was a significant natural gas extractor in the Middle East. 8. Venezuela: Holding about 5,500 km³ of proven reserves, Venezuela was a major natural gas producer in South America. 9. Nigeria: With approximately 5,100 km³ of proven reserves in 2013, Nigeria was Africa's largest natural gas extractor. 10. Algeria: With around 4,500 km³ of proven reserves, Algeria was another prominent natural gas producer in Africa. 11. Australia: Holding close to 3,800 km³ of proven reserves, Australia was a major natural gas extractor in the Asia-Pacific region. While the exact rankings may have changed since 2013, these countries remain important players in the global natural gas market.

When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Bangkok has become the world's top tourist destination, with 15.98 million visitors projected to visit Thailand's capital city this year, according to the third annual Global Destination Cities Index released by MasterCard on Monday. Based on data MasterCard collected from governments, central banks, related public agencies and airlines so far this year, the projection for the entire year says Bangkok is surpassing   London, the previous holder of the top place, by a very narrow margin. Monday's report marked the first time an Asian city has been projected to be the top-ranked tourist destination. London came in second, with 15.96 million visitors expected in 2013, and Paris, third, with 13.92 million visitors. MasterCard looked at 132 cities. Other Asian cities that made it to the Top-20 Global Destination Cities in 2013 include Singapore at number four, with 11.75 million visitors; Kuala Lumpur at number eight, with 9.2 million visitors; Hong Kong at number nine, with 8.72 million visitors; Seoul at number 11, with 8.19 million visitors; Shanghai at number 14, with 6.5 million visitors, Tokyo at number 16, with 5.8 million visitors, and Taipei, with 5.19 million visitors. The study found that Bangkok is experiencing a large increase in its number of tourists in 2013, up 9.8% from 2009. That compares to New York's increase at 5.0% and London's at 3.8%. Paris, meanwhile, saw a small dip in its number of tourists (negative 0.7%). Caroline Lledo, who was visiting Bangkok from France, said Thailand has many offerings. \\"We like culture and the people are so nice. We also love shopping here,\\" Ms. Lledo said. MasterCard Worldwide's global economic adviser Yuwa Hedrick-Wong cited   overall value for money spent for why Bangkok is attractive. That is true for Thailand overall as well. Answer:","output":"Which of the following statements about Bangkok as a tourist destination is correct, according to the third annual Global Destination Cities Index released by MasterCard? A) Bangkok was the second most visited city in the world in 2013, right after London, with a projected 15.98 million visitors. B) According to the MasterCard Index, Bangkok has surpassed London in tourism for the first time in 2013, with an increase in tourist numbers of 9.8% from 2009. C) The report indicates a decrease in visitors to Bangkok in 2013, despite being named a top tourist destination. D) Bangkok is the first European city projected to be the top-ranked tourist destination according to the Global Destination Cities Index. Correct Answer:  B) According to the MasterCard Index, Bangkok has surpassed London in tourism for the first time in 2013, with an increase in tourist numbers of 9.8% from 2009.  Explanation:  The article states that Bangkok was projected to be the world's top tourist destination in 2013 with 15.98 million visitors according to the MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index. Furthermore, the report marked the first time an Asian city had been projected to surpass all other global cities in terms of tourism, thereby making option B the correct choice. London, which was the previous holder of the top spot, came in second place with an expected 15.96 million visitors. This shows that option A is incorrect. Option C is also wrong because the article highlights that the number of tourists to Bangkok increased by 9.8% from 2009, not decreased.

Question: suppose Load dishes directly into dishwasher after use happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"C: no effect The process of weathering, as mentioned in the description, primarily involves the physical and chemical breakdown of rocks due to exposure to environmental factors such as water seeping into the rocks, freeze-thaw actions, and temperature fluctuations. The process of loading dishes directly into a dishwasher after use is not related to the natural processes of weathering and, therefore, would have no effect on the rate or occurrence of weathering. Loading dishes directly into a dishwasher is associated with maintaining cleanliness and order in households and minimizing the need for washing and drying dishes manually. It has no direct connection to the geological processes involved in weathering, which predominantly occurs outdoors and is influenced by factors like climate, atmospheric conditions, and the type of rock or mineral being broken down. While it's important to understand the relevance of different human activities on the environment, it's equally important to recognize which activities bear no direct impact. For instance, pollution, deforestation, or construction may indeed modify the natural conditions affecting weathering processes. However, household activities like dishwashing do not contribute to such alterations, and thus have no effect on whether weathering occurs more or less frequently or rapidly. In conclusion, loading dishes directly into a dishwasher after use has no effect on the occurrence or rate of weathering, as it is an unrelated activity that doesn't impact geological processes. The question's focus should be directed towards discussing human actions that do alter the environment and influence elements such as weathering, erosion, and climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: How might I feel about this ?","output":"To determine how you might feel about this situation, I will evaluate each emotion and justify the reasoning behind each possible choice. 1. Bored: Since getting pulled over for an RBT and dealing with heavy traffic on the F5 are both external events that caused you to be late to work, it seems unlikely that you would feel bored in this situation. Boredom is generally linked to a lack of stimulating or engaging experiences, which doesn't align with the situation described. Therefore, 'bored' is not a strong match for your feelings. 2. Angry: Considering you were delayed because of being pulled over for an RBT and subsequently having to deal with traffic on F5, it's reasonable to believe that these factors would cause frustration and irritation. Arriving late to work and being signed in late could also contribute to negative feelings. Thus, 'angry' is a plausible emotion for you to feel in this situation. 3. None of the above choices: If neither boredom nor anger adequately describes your emotions in the given situation, this option would hold true. 4. Curious: Curiosity is typically associated with a desire to gain knowledge or information. While there may have been slight curiosity regarding the reasons behind the heavy traffic on F5, for example, it's unlikely that curiosity would be the dominant emotion in response to being pulled over and arriving late to work. Based on the analysis, 'angry' seems to be the most likely emotion that you would feel in this situation due to the external factors leading to your tardiness and the resulting negative consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When high voltage applied to the gate NMOS will conduct why? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? OPT: (a). no (b). yes","output":"(a). No These two questions are inquiring about different aspects of technology. The first question is related to Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVTs) and their role in the future of transportation, especially with the advent of Electric Vehicles (EVs). The second question, on the other hand, is related to the functioning of n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (NMOS) when high voltage is applied to the gate. To address each question individually: 1. CVTs and their role in the future of transportation: Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVTs) are automatic transmissions that allow for an infinite number of gear ratios between a vehicle's lowest and highest gears. They offer a smooth driving experience and improved fuel efficiency compared to traditional automatic or manual transmissions. CVTs have been widely used in internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles for quite some time. With the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs), it may appear that CVTs may no longer hold a significant role in the future of transportation. The reason is that EVs have simpler drivetrain systems. They do not typically require multi-speed transmissions, as the electric motors in most EVs have the ability to deliver maximum torque across a wide range of speeds. This eliminates the need for gear shifting and allows for a more efficient, responsive, and smooth driving experience. Furthermore, electric vehicles utilize a single-speed transmission, which drastically simplifies the entire drivetrain and allows for better packaging, reduced weight, lower cost, and improved reliability compared to some ICE vehicles. However, this does not entirely rule out the possibility of CVTs playing a role in future transportation systems. Hybrid vehicles, which rely on a combination of combustion engines and electric motors, may continue to benefit from CVTs, especially for optimizing the ICE's efficiency in various driving situations. In addition, advancements in CVT technology or specific EV applications may open up new opportunities for utilizing CVTs in electric powertrains. Some manufacturers are experimenting with multi-speed transmissions for electric cars to further improve driving dynamics or efficiency at high speeds. 2. High voltage applied to the gate of an NMOS: When high voltage is applied to the gate of an n-channel MOSFET (NMOS), it conducts because of the formation of an electric field in the device's channel region. The gate voltage controls how much current flows between the drain and the source terminals. As an NMOS transistor operates, it switches between two states: the \\"on\\" state (conducting) and the \\"off\\" state (non-conducting). When a high voltage (ideally above the threshold voltage) is applied to the gate terminal, an electric field is formed in the channel region, creating a conducting path between the source and drain terminals. The higher the voltage applied to the gate, the stronger the electric field and the lower the resistance of the channel, leading to an increase in current flow between the drain and source. This causes the NMOS device to be in the \\"on\\" state. In summary, the two questions inquire about separate technological fields. The first question asks about the potential role of CVTs in the future transportation context, particularly with the rise of electric vehicles. The second question deals with the conductivity of NMOS transistors when high voltage is applied to the gate. Both topics are relevant and important in their respective domains but are not directly related to each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The cougar (Puma concolor), also commonly known as the puma, mountain lion, panther, or catamount, is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the biggest cat in North America and the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae, of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas. is a mountain lion and cougar the same thing? OPT: (i). no. (ii). yes.","output":"(ii). Yes, a mountain lion and cougar are the same species. They are known by various names such as puma, panther, or catamount, depending on the region they are found in. The scientific name of this species is Puma concolor, and it is the largest felid in North America, belonging to the subfamily Felinae. The cougar has a vast distribution, spanning from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America. This extensive range makes it the most widespread of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. Its adaptability to various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even desert regions, has contributed to its widespread prevalence. Aside from its adaptability, the cougar is also a generalist species, meaning that it can eat a variety of prey. Its primary diet consists of ungulates, such as deer and elk, but it also consumes smaller mammals like rabbits, rodents, and even insects when necessary. This ability to switch between different prey enables the cougar to thrive in diverse environments. Being a solitary animal, the cougar is rarely seen in groups except during mating season or when a mother is rearing her cubs. It is primarily nocturnal and crepuscular, with the majority of its activities taking place during dawn and dusk. However, daytime sightings are not uncommon. Due to its secretive nature and preference for habitats with dense undergrowth or rocky terrain, the cougar can be difficult to observe in the wild. Despite its size and power, the cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, such as the domestic cat, than to the larger cats of the subfamily Pantherinae. Its closest relative in the Americas is the jaguar, which belongs to the Pantherinae subfamily. The cougar's evolutionary lineage places it in the same subfamily as the lynx, ocelot, and serval, indicating a closer relationship to these smaller species. In summary, the mountain lion and cougar are indeed the same species, known by different names depending on the region. As an adaptable and generalist species, the cougar has the broadest distribution of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere and is closely related to smaller felines like the domestic cat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Article: Sons who have fond childhood memories of their fathers are more likely to be emotionally stable in the face of day-to-day stresses, according to psychologists who studied hundreds of adults of all ages. \\"As our study shows, fathers do play a unique and important role in the mental health of their children much later in life,\\" psychology professor Melanie Mallers of California State University said.               For this study, 912 adult men and women between the ages of 25 and 74 completed short daily telephone interviews about that day's experiences over an eight-day period. The interviews focused on the participants' psychological and emotional distress   (i.e.whether they were nervous, sad, etc.) and if they had experienced any stressful events that day.               The participants were also required to answer questions such as, \\"How would you rate your relationship with your mother during the years when you were growing up?\\" and \\"How much time and attention did your mother give you when you needed it?\\" The same questions were asked about fathers.               People who reported they had a good mother-child relationship reported three percent less psychological distress compared to those who reported a poor relationship, according to Mallers. Men who reported having a good relationship with their fathers during childhood were more likely to be less emotional when reacting to stressful events in their current daily lives than those who had a poor relationship, according to her findings.               Also, the quality of mother and father relationships was significantly associated with how many stressful events the participants faced on a daily basis. In other words, if they had a poor childhood relationship with both parents, they reported more stressful incidents over the eight-day study when compared to those who had a good relationship with their parents.               Mallers explained why healthy or unhealthy relationships may have an effect on how people handle stress as adults. \\"Perhaps having caring parents equips children with the experiences and skills necessary to more successfully navigate their relationships with other people throughout childhood and into adulthood,\\" she said.   Question: What do we know about the study from the passage?   Options: (A) It paid close attention to the effect of fathers on their children. (B) 912 children and adults took part in the study.

The primary sentiment of this review is positive because the reviewer defends the location against a one-star rating, highlighting their own good experiences with the service and ice cream. They mention their loyalty to the location, having been a regular customer for two years, and that they've always enjoyed the quality of the products. This positive sentiment is further emphasized by the use of a smiley face, showing that the reviewer is happy and satisfied with their experience at the Cold Stone Creamery. However, there is a neutral to mildly negative undertone in one part of the review where the reviewer acknowledges a potential issue with the location: the lack of seating. They state that if they had any complaints, it would be about the seating but they quickly brush it off as not being a significant issue. This indicates that the reviewer recognizes a possible area for improvement but chooses not to let it affect their overall sentiment about the location. The reviewer additionally refers to the person who submitted the negative review as a \\"whiner,\\" which could be seen as a slightly negative tone. However, this comment seems to aim at defending the location and asserting the positive sentiment of the review.

But did you ever wonder how and why this happens? To answer the question, first you have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots. And they take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose  . Glucose is a kind of sugar. Plants use glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis  . That means, \\"putting together with light\\". A chemical called chlorophyll   helps photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color1. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how trees \\"know\\" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. Trees rest during this time and live off the food they stored during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. Small amounts of these color1s have been in the leaves all along. We just can't see them in the summer, because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll. The bright reds and yellows we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples, glucose is caught in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn this glucose into a red color1. The brown color1 of trees like oaks   is made from waste left in the leaves. It is the mixture of all these things that makes the beautiful color1s we enjoy during autumn. From the text we can see that photosynthesis   _  .

The Rams were successful at limiting the Seahawks offense, holding running back Marshawn Lynch to a season low of only 23 yards and sacking quarterback Russell Wilson seven times. After holding the Rams to a field goal in the first quarter, the Seahawks went ahead with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate. The Rams responded in the third quarter with another field goal, cutting down the Seahawks' lead to 1. After an incomplete pass to Jermaine Kearse on the first play of the next drive, Wilson threw an 80-yard touchdown to Golden Tate. It was the longest play of either player's career. On his way towards the end zone, Tate turned and sarcastically waved towards Rams safety Rodney McLeod. Though the touchdown would count, the Seahawks would be penalized for taunting during the kickoff. Carroll chastised Tate after the penalty occurred, and Tate was fined 7,875 after the game. After the Seahawks allowed an additional Rams field goal, the game came down to the final drive. The Rams, in possession of the ball with 5:42 left in the game, managed to drive the ball all the way to the 6 yard line with less than 1:20 left on the clock. A missed throw from Rams quarterback Kellen Clemens and a 4-yard run from Rams running back Daryl Richardson allowed the Rams a 3rd and Goal at the 2-yard line, but a defensive offsides call on Seahawks defensive end Chris Clemons cut the distance in half. The Seahawks stopped an additional run from Richardson, and Rams head coach Jeff Fisher called a timeout with only 4 seconds left in the game. Seahawks cornerback Brandon Browner successfully defended Clemens's final pass towards Brian Quick, sealing the Seahawks victory and bringing their record to 7-1. Which team allowed the least points?","output":"The Seattle Seahawks allowed the least points in the Monday Night Football game against the St. Louis Rams. In a thrilling encounter, the Seahawks emerged victorious with a final score of 14-9. Despite the Rams' efforts in limiting the Seahawks' offensive play, they could only score through field goals and did not manage to score a touchdown during the game. The Seahawks' defense was effective in stopping the Rams from scoring higher. The Rams were held to a field goal in the first quarter, followed by another field goal in the third quarter. In the final minutes of the game, the Rams were threatening to score a touchdown, but the Seahawks' defense proved to be resilient. After a series of plays, including a missed throw by Rams' quarterback Kellen Clemens and a 4-yard run by Rams' running back Daryl Richardson, the Rams had a 3rd and Goal situation at the 2-yard line. A defensive offsides call on Seahawks defensive end Chris Clemons cut the distance in half, but the Seahawks still managed to stop an additional run from Richardson. With only 4 seconds left in the game, Rams' head coach Jeff Fisher called a timeout, setting up a final play for their team. Seahawks' cornerback Brandon Browner successfully defended Clemens's final pass towards Brian Quick, sealing the victory for Seattle and making their season record 7-1. In conclusion, the Seattle Seahawks allowed the least points during this Monday Night Football game by limiting the St. Louis Rams to only 9 points from three successful field goals. The effective and resilient defense of the Seahawks played a crucial role in securing their victory in this thrilling encounter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: French people pride themselves on their delicious foods, such as cheese, baguettes and croissants(two kinds of food). In fact, food is an important part of French culture. Families and friends spend hours over the dinner table each night. It is the opposite of the fast-food habit common in other parts of the West.  It's the reason why the French are very angry that a McDonald's is opening beneath Paris's most famous museum: the Louvre  . The new restaurant will be the 1,142nd McDonald's in France, and will open in the underground approach to the museum. But many French people can't understand why this American chain is opening in the heart of French culture.           However, McDonald's is paying no notice to the complaint. McDonald's now has 31,000 chains worldwide. Tourists are hungry, and opening chains in tourist spots pays well.           There is another chain threatening France's heritage. This time it is coffee rather than burgers. As more and more Starbucks open in Paris, traditional French cafes are forced to close.           The trouble with American companies opening chains throughout the world is the destructive effect they can have on a country's culture. How can a small, independent coffee shop compete with the multi-billion dollar chain? You can go to a Starbucks in any city in the world, but you can only go to a Parisian cafe in France.          Responsibility is with the tourists. A McDonald's wouldn't open so near the Louvre if it weren't not going to make money. Similarly, a Pizza Hut wouldn't overlook   Egypt's Great Pyramid if no one wants to sit in it. Maybe next time you visit the Great Wall, you should think twice before ordering a Cappuccino in the Starbucks.

Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired.

Barry Layne Moore is accused of selling prescription Oxycodone. Smith elaborated to the Toronto Sun: “I feel sorry for the people of Toronto—it is like something bad happening in the family, it kind of embarrasses the whole family.\\" He called on Ford to resign and said he understood that the city didn't have any way to force him out of office. In Hampton, by contrast, the process is already underway to suspend Moore. (While Toronto's city council can't oust Ford, it has stripped him of most of his powers.) Article:","output":"Title: Toronto's Mayoral Scandal Draws Comparisons to Florida's Hampton City: A Tale of Two Cities Introduction In a surprising turn of events, residents of Toronto find themselves being looked down upon by the police in Florida, thanks to Mayor Rob Ford's myriad troubles. As it turns out, Toronto isn't the only city dealing with elected officials involved in illegal drug activity. Bradford County in Florida is experiencing a similar controversy with the arrest of the city of Hampton's mayor, Barry Layne Moore, on drug charges. Municipalities Grapple with Mayoral Drug Charges Bradford County's sheriff, Gordon Smith, was quoted saying, \\"This isn't Toronto,\\" after arresting Moore for selling prescription Oxycodone. In an interview with the Toronto Sun, Smith expressed sympathy for the people of Toronto, stating, “I feel sorry for the people of Toronto—it is like something bad happening in the family, it kind of embarrasses the whole family.\\" Acknowledging the situation is embarrassing for both cities, Sheriff Smith calls for Ford to resign, much like the process that has been initiated for Moore in Hampton. Smith expounded further on the matter, emphasizing that in Bradford County, \\"We will not tolerate illegal drug activity\\" by anyone, including elected officials such as mayors. Unfortunately, for the citizens of Toronto, the city does not have any way to force Ford out of office. This contrasts sharply with Hampton, where a suspension process is already underway for Moore's removal from his position as mayor. Repercussions and the Power of City Councils While both cities face the challenge of having mayors involved in drug scandals, the power dynamics within their respective city councils differ significantly. Toronto has already taken steps to limit Ford's powers as mayor, but the city council does not have the ability to oust him. This means that, unless Ford chooses to resign, he can continue to hold the position of mayor despite his legal troubles. On the other hand, Hampton's city council is acting swiftly to suspend Moore in light of the charges laid against him. The stark difference in the powers held by the city councils of Toronto and Hampton highlight the unique circumstances faced by each city. Conclusion The unfolding events in both Toronto and the city of Hampton in Florida showcase not only the public's dissatisfaction with elected officials involved in illegal drug activity, but also the varied ways in which city councils are able to address the issue. As these two cities navigate through the challenges presented by their respective mayoral scandals, the world watches and waits to see how the situations will be resolved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The members of this phylum are commonly referred to as segmented worms or ringed worms. The main characteristic that distinguishes them is their long, cylindrical body divided into segments. The phylum Annelida comprises different types of worms including earthworms, leeches, marine worms like polychaetes, and species found in freshwater environments.  Earthworms are perhaps the most known annelids. They have bodies composed of ring-like segments called annuli. These creatures are well-known for their role in soil aeration and composting. Their ability to break down organic material helps to fertilize the soil and thus supports the growth of plants.  Another commonly recognized group within Annelida phylum are the leeches. These creatures are often found in freshwater environments, though some species exist in marine and terrestrial habitats. Some are notorious for being ectoparasites, feeding on the blood of their hosts, but many species are actually predatory, feeding on small invertebrates.  Polychaetes, also known as bristle worms, make up a large part of the Annelida phylum, with a significant presence in marine environments. They're often recognized by the bristles, or chaetae, that project from their bodies. These worms vary widely in habit and form, ranging from tiny to very large species. Some are free-swimming, others live within tubes they construct in the sediment, and yet others are burrowers. Each of these creatures -- earthworms, leeches, and polychaete worms -- are readily recognized examples of the diversity within the phylum Annelida.  The animals mentioned in the statement like snails, clams, and squids actually belong to the phylum Mollusca. This is a completely different phylum known for invertebrates with soft bodies, which are often protected by a hard shell. This phylum encompasses a broad range of creatures including not only snails, clams, and squids, but also octopuses, oysters, mussels, and numerous other organisms. While both phyla are grouped within the larger category of invertebrates, annelids and mollusks differ significantly in body structure and other characteristics. Therefore, snails, clams, and squids are not a correct response to the query regarding members of the phylum Annelida."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please write a short summary for the following article: How the Wilhelm Gustloff Was Sunk The sinking of the Titanic may be the most infamous naval disaster in history, and the torpedoing of the Lusitania the most infamous in wartime. But with death counts of about 1,500 and 1,200 respectively, both are dwarfed by what befell the Wilhelm Gustloff, a German ocean liner that was taken down by a Soviet sub on Jan. 30, 1945, killing 9,343 people—most of them war refugees, about 5,000 of them children. The victims of the worst maritime tragedy in history were not only Germans, but also Prussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Poles, Estonians and Croatians. World War II was drawing to an end, and the Soviet army was advancing. Though it would be months before the final fall of the Nazi regime, it was clear the end was coming—and they were desperate to escape before things came to a head. As a result, 10,582 people were packed onto a cruise ship that was meant to accommodate only about 1,900. Though some on the ship were Nazis themselves, others had been the victims of Nazi aggression. When three torpedoes hit the ship, there weren’t nearly enough lifeboats, and many of the those that did exist were frozen to the deck. The majority of the passengers drowned. Why is this event so little known? Novelist Ruta Sepetys can’t say for sure, but its obscurity made it exactly the kind of story she wanted to tell. The author has written a book for young readers called Salt to the Sea, out Tuesday, about four fictional young passengers on the Wilhelm Gustloff: an overeager Nazi manning the ship; a Lithuanian nurse doing her part but haunted by her past; a Polish girl concealing her nationality and the source of her pregnancy; and a Prussian carrying something Hitler wants. Sepetys, an international bestseller thanks to her first novel Between Shades of Gray (which shares a character crossover with Salt to the Sea) is drawn to “hidden histories.” She looked into the Wilhelm Gustloff after finding out that a cousin of hers would have been on board were it not for a last-minute decision to delay the travel, a choice that the cousin had feared would prove the wrong one. As it departed, “she was standing in the port crying, thinking that her life was over,” Sepetys says. The decision likely saved her life, in fact. Intrigued, Sepetys immersed herself in research, particularly relying on the book Death in the Baltic but also on firsthand accounts from survivors she interviewed. “I hope this doesn’t sound too dramatic,” she says, “but what surprised me the most was that anyone survived.” With the help of her publisher in Poland, she even tracked down two divers who had explored the wreck in the late ’60s under Soviet supervision. The Soviets were allegedly curious to see if the Germans had tried to use the refugee ship to evacuate treasure, too. “They did not share with me exactly what they brought up,” Sepetys says, “but yes, things were retrieved. And then there were instructions to detonate parts of the ship, because it was considered an obstruction in the water.” So why do so few people know about the Wilhelm Gustloff? Sepetys has a couple of theories. First, the Nazi regime actively tried to hide the facts. “They were amidst an evacuation and they didn’t want it to affect morale. They also were trying to hide the fact they were losing the war,” she says. “Some survivors reported that when they spoke of it, there was a knock on their door, and they were told, ‘Why are you telling stories about some ship? That didn’t happen.'” In the aftermath of the war, she adds, Germans were hesitant to claim that they had been victims of any kind, so those who were free to discuss what had happened might have chosen not to. Another reason, she says, “could be that the submarine captain [who sank the ship], Alexander Marinesko, was dishonorably discharged shortly after,” apparently for disorderly conduct. At the time, Sepetys guesses, the Russians did not want to draw attention to him—though in later years monuments would be dedicated to his naval valor. The Wilhelm Gustloff interested Sepetys as a story about refugees because her own Lithuanian father spent nine years in refugee camps before being settled in the U.S.—but she had no idea when she began her work that the story would prove relevant on a global scale, as the current influx of migrants in Europe draws comparisons to the migrations of the past. The author hopes getting to know her protagonists could help young readers and grown-ups alike empathize with people in situations far from their own. “Many families don’t have recent experience or connection to occupation or war,” she says. “But through story and characters, suddenly news and history become human.” Summary:","output":"The Wilhelm Gustloff, a German ocean liner, was sunk by a Soviet submarine on January 30, 1945, killing 9,343 people, the majority of which were war refugees and over 5,000 of them were children.

Emotional intelligence: Nurses with high emotional intelligence can better recognize, understand, and manage their own emotions, as well as the emotions of their patients. This helps in building rapport and maintaining strong ties with patients and colleagues. 3. Professionalism: Nurses maintaining a high degree of professionalism, adhering to nursing codes of ethics, and respecting patient confidentiality are more likely to be trusted by patients and colleagues, further enhancing relationships. 4. Collaboration: Nurses must work closely with various healthcare professionals, such as doctors, pharmacists, and therapists.

Movie title: Interstate 60 Movie plot: The story begins in a bar, where two men are discussing a thesis statement for an upcoming paper. One of them asserts that out of all the different realms of the world, America has no mythological character that grants wishes. Their conversation is interrupted by a man (Wayne Robson) who claims that they are wrong, and that such a character does exist. The man goes on to explain that this character is a man named O.W. Grant, the son of a Leprechaun and a Cheyenne Indian. The man explains that O.W. is more so apt to play tricks on people, but that every so often, he takes a shine to some of them. When the two men ask this stranger just what O.W. Grant looks like, the fellow replies that he wears a red bow tie, and smokes a pipe carved in the shape of a monkey-head. As the man leaves the two, he mentions that O.W. can be found along Interstate 60. The two men go to a nearby map, and after looking over the roadways, think the guy they were talking to must have been pulling there leg, as there is no Interstate 60.The scene then cuts to real-as-life O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman), wearing a red bow tie, and smoking a pipe carved in the shape of monkey-head (just as the guy described). Going down a street, a guy in a parked car to his right opens the driver's side door, not realizing O.W. is about to pass alongside. O.W. falls from his bike, breaking the jaw on his monkey-head pipe. As the man apologizes and attempts to help him up, a truck comes along, running over Grant's bike, and destroying the man's cellular phone. The destruction of the cellphone causes the man to break into a fury, cursing how he wishes the incident had never happened. Grant asks if the man means the wish, and when the angered fellow replies positively, Grant places his pipe in his mouth, and green smoke envelopes the two of them.The scene begins again, with Grant riding along the same path (though his monkey-head pipe is now broken). Just before Grant reaches the car, he stops. The man on the phone inside, gets out of the car... and steps right... Answer:","output":"No, I can't provide the specific town in Colorado that the package is addressed to, as it is not mentioned in the plot summary of the movie \\"Interstate 60\\". However, I can provide some insights on whether it's worth investing in this film proposal by discussing its genre, target audience, and potential themes. \\"Interstate 60\\" is a film that falls under the genres of adventure, comedy, and fantasy. The blend of these genres has the potential to attract a diverse audience due to its mix of humor, mythical elements, and adventure.

The target audience for this movie would be individuals who are interested in whimsical and thought-provoking films that explore the nature of wishes, myths, and destinies. The character of O.W. Grant and the involvement of his tricks on people could entice viewers who enjoy playful and mysterious characters with secret motives. Additionally, the film could explore themes such as human desire and the consequences of wishes coming true, creating a thought-provoking journey where the characters learn valuable life lessons. Furthermore, the movie's plot provides an opportunity for diverse settings, interesting scenes, and bizarre encounters that may intrigue viewers and keep them engaged throughout the storyline. However, it's crucial to consider the film proposal's budget, potential for profits, and associated risks before deciding to invest. You would need to analyze the attached budget breakdown, projected earnings, and the expertise of the production team to make an informed decision about the investment. If the script and funding are in place along with a capable team, it would strengthen the case for investing in this film proposal. In conclusion, \\"Interstate 60\\" has the potential to be a captivating and engaging film, but it's essential to weigh the costs and benefits before deciding to invest in it.

What is the solution?","output":"In order to solve the given equation 0 = 156*r - 116*r - 40 for r, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. We can combine the terms containing variable 'r', which are 156*r and -116*r. 0 = (156*r - 116*r) - 40 Step 2: Simplify the equation. Now, subtract 116*r from 156*r: 0 = 40*r - 40 Step 3: Isolate the variable 'r'. In this step, we will get 'r' alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we will add 40 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 40 = 40*r - 40 + 40 40 = 40*r Step 4: Solve for 'r'. Now, we have to get rid of the 40 that is multiplied with 'r'. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 40: 40/40 = 40*r/40 1 = r So, the solution for the equation 0 = 156*r -116*r - 40 is r = 1."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Options: - kitchen - tea room - china cabinet - kitchen cabinet - cup  Explain why a human would choose \\"china cabinet\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"china cabinet\\" as the ideal place to keep a saucer they don't use but want to look at for several reasons. A china cabinet, also known as a display cabinet, curio cabinet, or hutch, is a piece of furniture specifically designed for the purpose of displaying and storing valuable or decorative items, such as fine china, glassware, or collectibles. These cabinets often feature well-crafted woodwork and tempered glass doors that allow for easy visibility of the items stored inside. Here's a detailed explanation of why a china cabinet is the perfect choice for showcasing a saucer: 1. Preservation: A china cabinet offers a safe and secure place to store delicate items like a saucer. The enclosed design of the cabinet protects the saucer from dust, accidental damage, and wear and tear caused by regular handling. This ensures that the saucer remains in pristine condition, preserving its value and appearance for a long time. 2. Visibility: China cabinets are designed to display items prominently, making it easy for anyone to admire the saucer. The glass doors and sometimes built-in lighting showcase the saucer in the best possible light, allowing its details and craftsmanship to be clearly visible. This feature is particularly important if the saucer has sentimental value or is part of a larger collection that needs to be seen and appreciated. 3. Aesthetics: China cabinets are often attractive and elegant pieces of furniture that can enhance the décor of a living space. By placing the saucer in a china cabinet, it becomes a decorative element that can complement the existing design scheme of the room, adding a touch of sophistication and visual interest. This harmonizes well with the desire to look at the saucer and enjoy its beauty. 4. Organization: China cabinets are designed with shelves and compartments that allow for efficient organization and storage of items they hold. By placing the saucer in a china cabinet, it ensures that the item has a designated space within the home. This helps in minimizing clutter and maintaining a neat and orderly living environment. 5. Space utilization: In smaller homes or apartments, where space is a constraint, a china cabinet can be incredibly useful for maximizing available space. By consolidating all decorative and valuable items into one central location, a china cabinet prevents these objects from taking up valuable countertop, table or shelf space elsewhere in the home. In conclusion, a china cabinet is the best choice for storing and displaying a saucer that isn't regularly used but is meant to be looked at because it provides a safe, secure, and visually appealing environment for the saucer. The china cabinet showcases the beauty of the saucer while also contributing to the aesthetics and organization of the living space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1528, at the demand of Henry of the Palatinate, Prince-Bishop of Utrecht, Habsburg forces under Georg Schenck van Toutenburg, liberated the Bishopric, which was occupied by the Duchy of Guelders since 1521-1522.

Article:The man described in a leaked US cable as a \\"backroom deal-maker\\" served as deputy to former PM Abhisit Vejjajiva from 2008-2011. It was their administration that authorised a crackdown on anti-government street protests by supporters of ousted leader Thaksin Shinawatra in Bangkok in 2010. More than 90 people, mostly civilian protesters, died over the course of the two-month action. Both Mr Suthep and Mr Abhisit face what they call politically-motivated murder charges over the deaths. In 2013, when Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government mooted a controversial political amnesty bill, Mr Suthep quit the Democrat Party to lead protests. Critics said the bill would let Mr Thaksin - who is also Ms Yingluck's brother - return to Thailand without facing jail for corruption charges. \\"I realised that once the Yingluck government came to power, it would try to whitewash the wrongdoings of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra,\\" he told Thai newspaper The Sunday Nation. Mr Suthep has wielded power and influence in the Democrat Party for decades, serving as both agriculture and communication minister. He has come under fire during his political career before, most notably in 1995 when he was accused of giving the rich land rights under a land reform programme meant for the poor. The fall out led then-PM Chuan Leekpai to dissolve parliament. In 2010, when Mr Suthep was deputy prime minister, the government signed off security operations allowing the military to use force to disperse the pro-Thaksin red-shirt protesters occupying key parts of Bangkok. But in the wake of the violence, a government of Mr Thaksin's allies - led by his sister - was elected, and Mr Suthep found himself back in opposition. It was the Yingluck government's proposed political amnesty bill that provided the trigger for the protests. Opponents said it was intended to facilitate the return of Mr Thaksin to Thailand. Mr Suthep stepped down from politics to launch what he has described as protests to wipe out the \\"political machine of Thaksin\\". Mr Suthep led demonstrators who surrounded and occupied government buildings, while urging them to stay non-violent. As to his goal, he wants the government replaced with an unelected \\"people's council\\" to pick the country's leaders. \\"Foreigners may think that if the government wins in parliament, that means the majority of the people support them - but the fact is that this government bought votes with their money and corrupted the last election,\\" he said. The protesters following him tend to be urban and middle class voters, who are particularly concentrated in the capital and the south. Many are critical of Ms Yingluck's government spending, including an expensive rice subsidy scheme that has helped farmers in rural areas - traditional supporters of Mr Thaksin and his allies - but has hurt Thailand's exports. The demonstrators are also strongly opposed to Mr Thaksin. \\"I hate her government because they're dishonest. They spend our money, our tax money on Shinawatra businesses and their networks,\\" said one protester. \\"I want justice and we need democracy for the people. If the government is good, we would want them to continue to administer the country but they are not good,\\" said another. Many of them have voiced concerns similar to those expressed by anti-Thaksin \\"yellow-shirt\\" protesters who closed Bangkok's main international airport in 2008. Mr Suthep told reporters: \\"The people will quit only when the state power is in their hands.\\" He added: \\"If we don't succeed, then I am prepared to die in the battlefield.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"The leaked US cable reveals a man known as a \\"backroom deal-maker\\" who served as deputy to former Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva from 2008-2011.

He dropped off the radar for decades but rose to prominence suddenly last summer, when a major diplomatic crisis broke out in the Gulf.      {articleGUID}      After Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a land, sea and air blockade on Qatar in June, Sheikh Abdullah appeared frequently on Saudi and UAE television programmes expressing his views in support of the measures against Doha.      At an Arab League meeting in Cairo in September, Qatar's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Soltan bin Saad al-Muraikhi said Saudi Arabia was looking to depose Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and replace him with Sheikh Abdullah.      'Expected behaviour'      Majed al-Ansari, a professor at Qatar University, said Sheikh Abdullah's apparent detention could be seen as part of a wider \\"trend of behaviour\\" by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in dealing with high-profile Arab personalities that may be used as leverage.      {articleGUID}      In November, Lebanese officials alleged that Prime Minister Saad Hariri was being held hostage by Saudi authorities.      Hariri appeared on television from Saudi Arabia on November 4 to announce his resignation, but retracted it when he returned home.      Former Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik released a similar video in November, saying he was being barred from leaving the UAE, where he had been living since 2012.      \\"This is now the way that Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi deal with their friends,\\" al-Ansari told Al Jazeera.      \\"Sheikh Abdullah is of no use to these countries because their plan to orchestrate a coup in Qatar has failed miserably.\\" ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan      A Qatari royal says he is being held against his will in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).      Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali al-Thani - who played a role in negotiating with Saudi Arabia during the Qatar diplomatic crisis last year - made the claims in a YouTube video released on Sunday.      He claims he is being held by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince, who will be \\"fully responsible\\" if anything happens to him.      A UAE official denied the accusations.      In the video statement, the Qatari sheikh, a relative of the current Qatari emir, is seated in an armchair, talking directly to camera.      \\"I'm currently in Abu Dhabi, being hosted by Sheikh Mohamed. But this is not a hosting status. Rather, it is a 'holding' one. They told me not to move,\\" he says.      He continues: \\"I'd like to inform you that if something happens to me, Qatar will be innocent of it.\\"      Ali Rashid al-Nuaimi, who heads Abu Dhabi's education department and a counter-extremism centre, sent a series of tweets saying Sheikh Abdullah is free to go \\"whenever he wants\\".      Sheikh Abdullah brokered a deal with Saudi Arabia to allow Qatari pilgrims into the country after Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region cut diplomatic ties with Qatar in June 2017.      The video was published on a YouTube channel run by UAE 71 website.      An unexpected turn      By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor      This is a complete turnaround from last year when Sheikh Abdullah appeared out of nowhere as a significant player in the political feud pitting the Saudis and Emiratis against Qatar.      He won a diplomatic coup in apparently brokering a deal with Saudi Arabia to reopen its land border with Qatar so that its citizens could attend the Hajj.      A descendant of the founding father of Qatar, Sheikh Abdullah's branch of the royal family had been sidelined for decades. But suddenly he was everywhere, with legions of followers on Twitter.      The consensus was that he was very much acting with the approval of the UAE and Saudi Arabia - with even some speculation that they might be considering him as a replacement leader in Qatar. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, claims he is being held against his will in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Pet stores often will not carry Betta fish medication, meaning that you will need to order it online. If you do this after your Betta fish gets sick it will likely be too late. Complete first aid kits are available online.  However, you can try to save money by ordering the necessary supplies separately. Basic medications include: Bettazing or Bettamax, Kanamycin, Tetracycline, Amplicillin, Jungle Fungus Eliminator, Maracin 1, and Maracyn 2. Most Betta fish ailments are caused by improper feeding and cleaning. These will be examined in greater detail later. However, a few things to always keep in mind include:  Clean the tank regularly. To keep it clean, do not overcrowd with too many fish, add aquarium salt to water, and disinfect the tank. To limit the spread of disease from one fish to another, immediately remove dead fish, quarantine new fish for two weeks before introducing them to a tank, and wash your hands after handling fish.  Do not overfeed fish or allow food to rot in tank. The most obvious way to tell that a Betta fish is sick is to observe whether or not it wants to eat. If it is not eating or appears unexcited at the sight of food, it is likely sick. Other signs of illness include a less vibrant color or strange discolorations. Others signs that your betta fish is sick include: rubbing against items in the tank as if to scratch itself; swollen, protruded eyes; raised scales that protrude out toward you; lethargy; and a fin that is clumped together rather than spread out.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of proactive care for Betta fish, as medications may not be readily available locally, and offers suggestions on maintaining a clean tank, proper feeding, and recognizing signs of illness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Consider că este foarte important ca UE să joace un rol-cheie în organizațiile internaționale.

This sentiment likely stems from the perspective that the European Union, being composed of 27 member countries primarily located in Europe, is one of the major socio-political and economic powerhouses globally. Such involvement could entail actively shaping and contributing to the decision-making process and policies being established at an international level. This ranges from fields like environment, human rights, global health, trade, security, to technology and scientific research. By playing a key role, the EU could ensure that the interests and values of its member countries are aptly considered and integrated. Moreover, by playing a key role in international organizations, the EU can effectively channel its viewpoints, negotiate, collaborate, and reach a consensus with other worldwide powers. This can foster a more harmonious global environment and provide solutions to large-scale, cross-border challenges like climate change, migration, poverty, digital transition, etc. Therefore, the EU’s active engagement can help contribute to progress, harmony, and stability on a global level, thus amplifying the importance of their role in international organizations.

WHITE HOUSE — An audio recording was released Monday depicting children desperately crying and begging for their parents after being separated from them by U.S. immigration authorities at its southwestern border, sparking new outrage against the Trump administration and its new \\"zero-tolerance policy\\" towards illegal immigrants. The nearly eight-minute long recording was released by ProPublica, an independent, investigative news site. ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center. At one point in the audio, a man identified as a Border Patrol agent said in Spanish over the cries of scores of children: \\"Well, we have an orchestra here. What's missing is a conductor.\\" President Donald Trump defended his administration's policy of forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico on Monday, saying “The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility.\\" Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that “what’s happening in Europe … we can’t allow that to happen to the United States – not on my watch.” Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate.

Step 1: Figure out the preferences and needs of both individuals I considered the dietary needs of both Kayla and Victoria. Kayla craved a rib roast while Victoria, being a vegetarian, needed an alternative option. Step 2: Identify the common ground between them Although they had different food preferences, their shared love for spending time together was the common ground I focused on to ensure they could still enjoy their meal together. Step 3: Propose a suitable solution that accommodates both individuals By highlighting the common interest in spending time together, I created a scenario where Kayla and Victoria could enjoy a meal that satisfied both of their dietary preferences. Step 4: Keep the narrative engaging and relatable To make the text interesting and easily relatable, I concentrated on the characters' desire to accommodate each other's needs and ensure their bond remains strong. Continuing the text: As a compromise, Kayla suggested they go to a restaurant that offered a variety of both meat and vegetarian dishes. This way, she could satisfy her craving for rib roast and Victoria could choose a sumptuous vegetarian meal. They picked a cozy, local spot and planned to meet there at 7 PM on a Friday night.

Step 7: Enhance the atmosphere with vivid descriptions To embed the readers into the setting, I chose to describe the restaurant as \\"cozy\\" and \\"local,\\" allowing them to visualize the ambiance and enhance their engagement with the story. As the evening arrived, Kayla and Victoria met at the restaurant, excited to catch up and share a good meal together. They poured over the eclectic menu and finally settled on their choices: a flavorful rib roast for Kayla and a hearty vegetable stir-fry for Victoria. As the night stretched on, they laughed and chatted, enjoying not just the food but the warm connection that transcended their dietary differences.

Sentence 1: i don't think they give them the death penalty if given today anyway Sentence 2: The death penalty is still the best option and is commonly used. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"It's important to examine the context and implications of both sentences and compare their validity in order to determine whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence holds true. Sentence 1: \\"I don't think they give them the death penalty if given today anyway.\\" This statement seems to suggest that in the present day, the death penalty is either not given or is much less common than it has been in the past. The use of the phrase \\"I don't think\\" indicates a level of uncertainty or subjectivity on the part of the speaker, but overall, the sentence implies that the death penalty is not the preferred or common method of punishment in the current context. Sentence 2: \\"The death penalty is still the best option and is commonly used.\\" In contrast, this sentence clearly states that the death penalty is not only still used, but it is also considered the best option for punishment. This statement appears to be more assertive, suggesting a higher level of certainty or conviction on the part of the speaker. The phrase \\"is commonly used\\" seems to contradict the idea presented in the first sentence that the death penalty is not given or is much less common today. To determine whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, we need to consider the following points: 1. The timeline of events: While the first sentence refers to the current context, the second sentence could be a general statement about the death penalty throughout history or in certain parts of the world. If that's the case, then it is possible for both sentences to be true. However, if both sentences are referring to the same context, then they seem to be in contradiction with each other. 2. The level of certainty: The first sentence conveys an element of uncertainty, while the second one is more assertive. It might be that the person who made the first statement was simply misinformed or unsure about the prevalence of the death penalty. In this case, if the first sentence is considered true, then the second sentence might also be true, as it may reflect a different perspective that is more informed or accurate. 3. Different conditions or scenarios: Both sentences could be interpreted as pertaining to different situations or conditions that could change the status of the death penalty. For example, the first sentence could be referring to a specific region where the death penalty is not commonly used, while the second sentence could be true in areas where it is still a common practice. In this scenario, both sentences could be true, but they would not be referring to the same context. Based on this analysis, it's difficult to definitively conclude whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true without knowing the context in which these statements are made. However, since the two statements appear to contradict each other when presumed to be within the same context, it's more likely that if the first sentence is considered true, the second sentence would be false or at least not entirely accurate in that specific context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Roots is an American hip hop band, formed in 1987 by Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The Roots are known for a jazzy and eclectic approach to hip-hop featuring live musical instruments. Malik B., Leonard \\"Hub\\" Hubbard, and Josh Abrams were added to the band (formerly named \\"The Square Roots\\"). Since its first independent album-length release the band has released 10 studio albums, two EPs, two collaboration albums (with other artists), and also collaborated on recordings and in live shows with a wide variety of artists in many musical genres. The Roots' original lineup included Tariq \\"Black Thought\\" Trotter (MC) and Ahmir \\"Questlove\\" Thompson (drums), classmates at the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts. As they began to play at school and on local streets, they added bassist Josh \\"The Rubberband\\" Abrams, who went on to form the jazz group The Josh Abrams Quartet. They later added another MC, Malik Abdul Basit-Smart (\\"Malik B.\\") and Leonard Nelson \\"Hub\\" Hubbard (bass), and Scott Storch (keyboards). Kenyatta \\"Kid Crumbs\\" Warren (MC) was in the band for Organix, the Roots' first album release. Another MC, Dice Raw, joined the band in cameo appearances on later albums. The band filled Storch's position with Kamal Gray (keyboards), who continues in that capacity. Kamal Gray did not play with the Roots on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon between April or May and early September 2012. His absence was not publicly explained, however on the September 17, 2012 (NBC's 'Late Night' 700th) episode, Gray returned to the group. Beatboxer Rahzel was a band member from 1995 to 1999. Alongside Rahzel was turntablist/vocalist Scratch, who also DJ'd in live concerts. However Scratch left abruptly in 2003. Malik B. left the group in 1999 due to personal reasons but continued to record, making occasional cameos on some albums. Guitarist Ben Kenney, had a brief stint with the group and contributed to the Phrenology album, but left to join Incubus as bassist. Percussionist Frank Knuckles joined the lineup in 2002 and guitarist Kirk \\"Captain Kirk\\" Douglas replaced Kenney. Vocalist Martin Luther toured with the Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to the Tipping Point album. The group announced in August 2007 that its longtime bassist Leonard Hubbard was leaving. Owen Biddle was the band's bassist in 2007-2011.  The band announced on August 25, 2011 that Owen Biddle left the band, replaced by Mark Kelley. On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, James Poyser plays additional keyboards.  Because most of the band members hail from Philadelphia and its surrounding area, they showed their support for the Phillies during the 2009 World Series against the Yankees, displaying Phillies memorabilia when performing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On the episode which aired the day after the Yankees clinched the title, Questlove stated \\"No comment!\\" on the show's intro (when he usually states the episode number), and had a Yankees logo purposely displayed upside-down on his drumset. In 2010, the group showed support for the Flyers during their run to the Stanley Cup Final by having the team logo on their drumset, and again in 2014 when the Flyers faced the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.  In April 2017, Frank Knuckles left the Roots due to family issues, and has not appeared on The Tonight Show since then. Later in August 2017, Knuckles sued Questlove, Black Thought and the band manager Shawn Gee over unpaid royalties.

A stomach-filling ‘anti-hunger’ additive is being used to make yoghurts and smoothies that help dieters lose weight by making them feel full after eating small amounts. Scientists are developing the ingredient, SATISFIT-LTG, as a slimming aid. Dr Carsten Huettermann, from German firm Dow Wolff, told the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that tests found volunteers felt full after eating smaller amounts of food containing the substance. Diet of the future: A stomach-filling 'anti-hunger' additive is being used to help dieters lose weight by making them feel full after eating small amounts. Volunteers who ate food containing the additive consumed 13 per cent fewer calories when given a second meal two hours later. The additive is a new version of a substance called methyl cellulose, which is used as a binding agent in snacks such as ready meals and baked goods. A white power, which dissolves in hot water it turns into a gel when it is heated and has been in use for 50 years, almost gluing ingredients together in food. It could be used in a variety of cold foods including yogurts. Conventional versions of methyl. cellulose pass through the stomach too rapidly to have an impact on. satiety, said Dr Huettermann. But the new additive forms a gel at body. temperature which lingers in the stomach before passing into the small. intestine. Dr Carsten Huettermann, from Dow Wollf Cellulosics in Bomlitz, Germany, told the American Chemical Society's annual meeting in Philadelphia: 'This ingredient would make people feel full after eating smaller amounts of food. 'With that sense of fullness and hunger-satisfaction, they would not crave more food. 'In our first study, we saw that fewer calories were consumed at the following meal after eating our new product. Our next step now is to investigate in further studies the mechanism of action and whether this may have an impact on weight management. SATISFIT-LTG is being developed as a potential ingredient in chilled products such as smoothies and yoghurts, Dr Huettermann added. Emma Williams, a member of the Nutrition Society, told The Daily Telegraph: 'Although these findings are interesting because this is a proof-of-concept study much more research is needed to understand the processes as well as the implications for long-term weight reduction.

Article: After a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former Confederacy following the Reconstruction Era, and bans on interracial marriage in various parts of the country, more people are openly forming interracial unions. In addition, social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to \\"pass\\" as white. Diverse immigration has brought more mixed-race people into the United States, such as the large population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos. Since the 1980s, the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement (cf. Loving Day). Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins, the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial. In 2008 Barack Obama was elected as the first multiracial President of the United States; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African American.

Raleigh, North Carolina In the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. They were unsuccessful. In 1900, the state legislature passed a new constitution, with voter registration rules that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office, local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive. It was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices. No African American was elected to Congress until 1992. Q: When did black regain the right to vote?","output":"Blacks regained the right to vote after the federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from the following.  a). Yes.  b). No. Answer:","output":"a). Yes. The correct answer is \\"plants.\\" As stated in the question, photosynthesis is the process during which plants convert carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates for themselves. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of green plants, algae, and some bacteria and plays a vital role in supporting life on Earth. During photosynthesis, green plants and other photosynthetic organisms capture solar energy and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates, which serve as their primary source of nutrition and energy. Oxygen is also released as a byproduct of this process, providing a crucial component of the air Earth's inhabitants breathe. Indeed, photosynthesis allows for the production of the necessary nutrients and energy required by plants for growth, reproduction, and overall survival. In summary, the correct answer to the question \\"photosynthesis is when what converts from carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy into carbohydrates?\\" is \\"plants\\" (option a).

Despite agreeably short running time and committed perfs, Edmond is rendered inert by its stagy atmosphere and failure to fully mine the depths of its protagonist's complex psyche. 2. Edmond posits that the fury of a sexist, racist psychopath lies just beneath the surface of even the mildest man. In other words, we're in David Mamet World. 3. works well enough, until we come to the last 20 or so minutes of the thing 4. As there's always at least one obscure independent in the annual Oscar race, the whole thing might as well begin here. 5. a fussy little movie that wants to be much more controversial and important than it is. 6. Mamet's script may not be entirely convincing as either satire or social commentary, but in Macy's hands, poor, pathetic Edmond's story finds its shocking, darkly funny resonance. 7. Go, by all means, but be prepared to take a beating. 8. It may be too bleak for most, and as befits a movie based on a one-act play (written by Mamet in 1982), it can be speechy. 9. Começando com a promessa de se revelar um novo Um Dia de Fúria (\\"Uma Noite...\\", neste caso), o filme jamais alcança a intensidade esperada e se enfraquece ainda mais em seu terceiro ato desajeitadamente satírico. Mas Macy está genial. 10. William H. Macy, Joe Mantegna and a number of other true pros manage to keep straight faces all the way through this woozy, self-important stew of lurid nonsense. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","output":"Most people thought the movie was okay, but not great. They liked the actors' performances, especially a man named Macy, because they felt he did a really great job. But many people felt like the movie didn't go deep enough to make the main character seem real and believed it wasn't very powerful or important, even though it tried to be. Some people also thought the movie was a bit too talky, meaning it had a lot of speech and dialogue. The last part of the movie didn't please many people. A few people even thought the movie was a bit too sad or dark for their tastes. And one review in another language (Portuguese) seemed to feel that the film didn't reach the expected intensity and became weaker in its third act.

On the other hand, classical (analog) television transmissions are usually horizontally polarized, because in urban areas buildings can reflect the electromagnetic waves and create ghost images due to multipath propagation. Using horizontal polarization, ghosting is reduced because the amount of reflection of electromagnetic waves in the p polarization (horizontal polarization off the side of a building) is generally less than s (vertical, in this case) polarization. Vertically polarized analog television has nevertheless been used in some rural areas. In digital terrestrial television such reflections are less problematic, due to robustness of binary transmissions and error correction. When is ghosting reduced?","output":"Ghosting is reduced when horizontally polarized classical (analog) television transmissions are used, particularly in urban areas. This is because the horizontally polarized electromagnetic waves experience less reflection off the sides of buildings compared to vertically polarized waves. Reflections caused by multipath propagation can create ghost images, which can degrade the overall quality of the television signal. In urban environments, buildings and other structures have a higher probability of reflecting the electromagnetic waves and causing multipath propagation issues. Horizontal polarization (p polarization) is generally less affected by these reflections than vertical polarization (s polarization), therefore reducing ghosting. As a result, horizontal polarization is often preferred for analog television transmissions in urban settings. For digital terrestrial television, ghosting is less problematic due to the robustness of binary transmissions and the incorporation of error correction techniques. These digital transmissions can better handle reflections and other signal disturbances, minimizing the impact of ghosting. In summary, ghosting is reduced when horizontal polarization is used for analog television transmissions, especially in urban areas where multipath propagation caused by building reflections is more likely to occur. Digital television transmissions are less prone to ghosting due to their inherent error correction and resilience against signal disturbances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The review depicted in this question casts the product in an unflattering light. A detailed analysis of the review reveals several points that illustrate the dissatisfaction of the reviewer and their concerns about the product's quality, packaging, and overall value. 1. \\"Too costly and inefficient\\": The title of the review itself is a strong indicator that the reviewer does not find the product to be valuable or efficient in its purpose. Describing a product as \\"too costly\\" implies that the price point is not justified by the benefits or features it offers. Additionally, labeling the product as \\"inefficient\\" suggests that it may not perform its intended function as effectively or adequately as expected by the user. 2. \\"Overstated the value of 3\\": This statement further emphasizes the reviewer's belief that the product's value is overstated or exaggerated. They seem to be comparing the said product with other similar products and find that it does not measure up in terms of quality or performance. Mentioning the value of \\"3\\" indicates that the product may have been evaluated on a scale, and the reviewer found it to be lacking in various aspects. 3. \\"Quality as the Chinese counterparts\\": Drawing a comparison between the product in question and its Chinese counterparts hints at a perceived lack of quality or reliability in the product. Chinese products, especially electronic gadgets, sometimes have a reputation for being cheaper and of lower quality.  By making this comparison, the reviewer is suggesting that the product in question is not better than its more affordable competition, and therefore, may not be worth the higher price. 4. \\"Packaging - just polyethylene\\": The reviewer's mention of the packaging being merely polyethylene indicates dissatisfaction with the product's presentation. This might imply that the packaging materials are not eco-friendly, or the reviewer expected higher quality and more durable packaging. An unimpressive packaging could potentially reflect negatively on the overall perception of the product, leading to doubts about its quality and performance. 5. \\"When the flash has the effect of built-in flash\\": This statement suggests that the reviewer experienced issues with the product's flash function during use, possibly causing a subpar performance. The mention of the \\"effect of built-in flash\\" hints at a lack of differentiation or enhancement compared to what is typically expected or experienced with built-in flashes of similar devices. 6. \\"Do not buy it\\": The conclusion of the review clearly and explicitly discourages others from purchasing the product. This statement reinforces the overall unflattering depiction of the product as presented by the reviewer. In summary, the review paints a negative picture of the product, highlighting perceived issues related to cost, efficiency, quality, packaging, and performance. The reviewer has shared their dissatisfaction with the product and advises against purchasing it, which undoubtedly places the product in an unflattering light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nekhorvich, an old friend of Ethan, had forewarned the IMF of his arrival, planning to deliver to them a new bioweapon, Chimera, and its cure, Bellerophon. He was forced to develop these by Biocyte Pharmaceuticals. IMF determines that rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose is responsible. IMF assigns Ethan to recover the virus and its cure. It also insists that he recruits Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in Seville, Spain. Later, Ethan finds out that she is Ambrose's ex-girlfriend. After recruiting Nyah, Ethan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in Sydney, Australia, where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah gets close to Ambrose and begins to learn about the Chimera virus. At a horse racing event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues. He then blackmails McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals video footage and transfers it to Ethan.

Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. The IMF team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, they learn that the only samples of Bellerophon were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands.

A:","output":"Title: \\"Broken Memories\\" Genre: Drama/Mystery Plot: Han, a once-acclaimed race car driver, now lives a quiet and solitary life. Every year on the anniversary of a fatal accident, he relives the guilt and heartache by deliberately smashing the car that once brought him so much excitement and joy. Afterward, he meticulously repairs the vehicle to bring it back to its original condition and to help him remember the loved ones he lost - his wife and son who were both in the car during the accident. The story begins when a young journalist, Sarah, who is working on a story about fallen sports heroes, arrives in Han's small town. Intrigued by the mystery surrounding the man who disappeared from the limelight, she makes it her mission to get an exclusive interview with him. Her persistence eventually leads her to uncover the true nature of Han's annual ritual, as well as the complex layers of tragedy and guilt deeply embedded in his psyche. One day, while Han is out in his car, he encounters a young boy, Lucas, stranded on the side of the road. When Han stops and offers to help fix Lucas's broken-down bike, they quickly form a bond. Lucas, who is passionate about cars, reminds Han of his late son. This connection leads Han to slowly open up to both the boy and Sarah. As his relationship with these two new people in his life deepens, Han struggles with the guilt of having survived the tragic accident that claimed his family. Han's annual ritual and newfound relationships force him to confront not only his past but also the possibility of a future beyond his grief. Sarah helps him realize that he has been keeping his loved ones alive through his repetitive actions of smashing and fixing the car. It is a vessel for his guilt and pain, which prevents him from fully healing. As the anniversary of the accident approaches, Han confronts the pain head-on and decides not to go through with his annual ritual of smashing the car for the first time in years. Instead, he invites Sarah and Lucas to join him in honoring the memory of his wife and son by visiting their graves and lighting candles. The three of them come together as a symbol of hope and healing, with Han acknowledging that it is time to move forward. In the end, Han begins to accept that he can't change the past, but he can give himself permission to live and love again. As he embraces this new chapter in his life, he finds solace and strength in the connections he's built with Sarah and Lucas, reminding him of the power of love, forgiveness, and redemption."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

This House would build the Keystone XL pipeline What is a possible side to this debate?","output":"A possible side to this debate is the support for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. This support may be based on the argument that this pipeline will create economic benefits and contribute to North American energy security. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the points highlighting this argument: 1. Job creation: Building the Keystone XL pipeline would provide an opportunity to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs during the construction phase. Supporters of the pipeline argue that this job creation will benefit local communities and the overall economy. 2. Economic development: The construction of the pipeline may lead to economic development along its path. New businesses could open in these areas, providing an economic boost to local communities. 3. Energy security: The Keystone XL pipeline would transport crude oil from Canada to US refineries, reducing the dependence on oil imports from countries that may be politically unstable or have hostile relations with the US. This would, in turn, help to secure North America's energy supply. 4. Strengthening US-Canada relations: Building the pipeline might help strengthen the political and economic relationship between the US and Canada, as they collaborate on large-scale energy projects. 5. Benefit to consumers: By increasing the amount of oil transported to US refineries, the pipeline may lead to a higher supply of oil, potentially resulting in lower fuel prices for consumers. 6. High safety standards: Modern pipelines, such as the Keystone XL, have strict safety standards and are monitored using advanced technology, which may reduce the risk of spills compared to other means of transportation like rail or trucking. Critics of the project, on the other hand, argue that it might contribute to environmental degradation, exacerbate climate change, and have long-lasting negative consequences for affected communities.

Emily and Dan Goodman instead decided to combine a variety of coronavirus-safe activities for their son, an avid Star Wars fan. The day includes a social-distancing treasure hunt of sorts; dancing in the streets in his Storm Trooper costume, with friends kept at a contagion-proof distance; and a virtual Zoom party featuring treats delivered to the homes of Reuben’s playmates and left outside their front doors. Their aim was to make their pre-schooler feel like the center of the universe on his special day, even though he was unable to have a traditional party this year. “Parents are trying very hard to create positive birthday memories,” said Emily Goodman, a communications executive who has been working at home in self-quarantine since mid-March under orders of her office in New Jersey. “He knows we can’t be close to our friends because of the invisible germs.”  The Goodmans are not the only Americans who have had to adapt to restrictions on social life in the wake of the pandemic, which has forced the cancellation of traditional birthday bashes for both young and old. U.S. deaths from the novel coronavirus have topped 25,400, doubling in one week, according to a Reuters tally, as officials debate how to reopen the economy without reigniting the outbreak. Despite the outbreak, Americans are still finding ways to have fun. In many small towns across the country, local police and fire departments are staging parades in front of children’s’ homes on their birthdays, complete with flashing lights and sirens. Friends and families are using Zoom video conferencing to throw virtual parties, featuring renditions of “Happy Birthday,” a song that has become a coronavirus anthem. (Health experts say a thorough hand-washing takes 20 seconds, about the time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” twice.) In San Diego, California, when a former U.S. Marine couldn’t go anywhere for her 104th birthday, her friends brought the party to her front lawn. “Well, I can’t believe it. It’s amazing,” Ruth Gallivan gasped, as honking cars festooned with birthday decorations drove by at a safe distance. Anxiety around birthdays is spiking for children struggling with the concept of social distancing, Anthony Field, founder of the Wiggles, a popular Australian musical act, told Reuters in an email. “Parents have told us their child is worried that if no one can come to their party, ‘Does it mean (I) still turn 4?’” said Field, better known as the Blue Wiggle. In a new “Social Distancing” song, with more than 540,000 views since it went online March 29, the Wiggles assure fans that a video party counts as a genuine celebration, Field said. In New Jersey, Reuben’s mother invited more than 20 neighbors to post drawings of Star Wars heroes and villains in their front windows, where her son could see them during a social-distancing walk on Tuesday, his fifth birthday. Neighbors young and old agreed to dress up in futuristic costumes and join Reuben, wearing a new Storm Trooper outfit, as he danced on his front lawn. Adults would make sure everyone stayed at least the recommended six feet apart from one another. Later, his friends were set to join him in a Zoom party that would feature a children’s musician strumming “Happy Birthday”  and enjoy party goodie bags with toys that Reuben ordered from a local store and custom Star Wars cookies ordered from a local bakery. Reuben’s mother, wearing a face bandana and disposable gloves, planned to drop them off at his friends’ front doors, wiping down each one with disinfectant. Reuben said he had another present for all the party-goers, who are presumably as tired of being separated from friends as he was. His special treat? “To look at me,” he said.

Answer:","output":"\\"Freeway\\" aligns with human common sense as an answer to the question \\"Where would there be a connection to go to another place?\\" because, in the most practical sense, a freeway is a key infrastructure element that physically connects different locations. It holds true not just in the literal but also in a broader contextual sense. When we think of connections and going to different places, our mind doesn't just picture scientific or computerized connections like circuits or networks, it also conceives transportation connections like roads, bridges, railways, and airports. All these are common ways that humans interact with the physical world to travel and transport goods between diverse regions. In the concept of transportation systems, freeways or highways are the primary conduits for personal and commercial transportation. They are designed with multiple lanes and limited access points to provide fast and efficient transit, thus successfully connecting cities, states, or even different countries. Without such a complex network of freeways, our ability to navigate geographically would be incredibly hampered. For example, if one wants to travel by car from San Francisco to Los Angeles, they would utilize a freeway (like I-5 in California) to make this journey. The freeway, in this context, serves as the physical connection between these two major cities. Traversing from one city to another would be impractical, time-consuming, and potentially impossible without this connection. Besides facilitating transportation, freeways also effectively encourage economic, social, and cultural exchanges by bringing distant places closer together, thereby fostering cooperation and connection among diverse communities. The impact and presence of freeways in our daily lives make it a realistic answer from a human common sense perspective when discussing connections to different places. This is why the answer \\"freeway\\" makes perfect sense and aligns with a human's pragmatic and logical understanding of connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Venus flytrap grows in  _  . A) most parts of the world B) some parts of Africa C) dry parts of the United States D) wet parts of England","output":"While it is true that plants cannot eat people, there are indeed several species of plants that consume insects and small animals to obtain necessary nutrients, particularly nitrogen. One of the most well-known and intriguing carnivorous plants is the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula). The Venus flytrap is native to subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of the United States, primarily in the states of North and South Carolina. This plant is unique for its specialized leaves that act as traps for unsuspecting insects and arachnids. The trapping mechanism consists of two hinged lobes extending from the leaf, which can open and close rapidly in response to stimuli. On the inner surfaces of these lobes, tiny hairs function as sensitive triggers. When an insect lands on the Venus flytrap and unintentionally brushes against one of these hairs, the lobes will quickly clamp shut, sealing the insect within. Once the unfortunate prey is trapped, the plant begins to digest it. The entire digestive process may take up to several days, depending on the size of the insect. Insects provide a significant source of nitrogen, which is essential for plant growth and development. The nitrogen inside the trapped insect serves as a supplementary nutrient source for the Venus flytrap, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soil conditions. Carnivorous plants like the Venus flytrap have evolved this specialized mechanism due to the lack of essential nutrients in their natural habitats. By trapping and consuming insects, they are able to obtain the necessary nitrogen to survive and grow. There is no need for concern, however, as carnivorous plants are not capable of consuming humans or anything larger than small insects and animals. To answer the question, the Venus flytrap grows in: C) dry parts of the United States It is worth noting that the specific regions the Venus flytrap inhabits are the subtropical wetlands of the East Coast, mostly in North and South Carolina.

Finding a company that agrees with your own personal values can make sure that you will be comfortable working there.  This can also help by assuaging any fears that your new employer might have regarding how well you will fit their culture.  Try looking online at the company's website to get a better feel for their culture. Ask any contacts you might have what the culture is like at the place you are investigating. Looking up reviews of the company can give you a good idea of how they interact with either past employees or customers. Most every employer will have some kind of social networking presences that you can examine. When searching for a position after being self-employed, it can be a good idea to focus the search on companies that have a unique need for your skill set.  Presenting yourself as someone capable of filling a specific need that an employer might have can give you the advantage and allow your application to be taken into consideration. Keep this in mind when crafting your resume and objective. If they need a team leader, you can emphasize your ability to self-start and keep yourself on task, which will translate nicely. Finding a new position and successfully obtaining it using large on-line databases or other traditional job search methods might work.  However, these methods can be difficult for a previously self employed person to find success with.  Instead, networking is the best option for finding an open position and getting an interview after being self employed.  Make your professional goals known to those you meet.  You never know who might end up helping you obtain a new position. Finding a friend that already works in a field you're interested is a great way to make contacts in that field.

The husband of a Saudi rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison said his wife is \\"a crushed human being,\\" but blamed a judge -- not the Saudi judicial system -- for treating her as a criminal. Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim. Saudi society is respectful of women, he said, adding that he had faith his wife would get justice. The ruling relates to an incident in March 2006 when the woman, then 18 and engaged to be married, and an unrelated man were abducted from a mall in Qatif, Saudi Arabia, by a group of seven men. She was later raped. In October, the men were convicted and sentenced to two to nine years in prison for the assault. She was convicted of violating the kingdom's strict Islamic law by not having a male guardian with her at the mall. \\"From the outset, my wife was dealt with as a guilty person who committed a crime,\\" said her 24-year-old husband. \\"She was not given any chance to prove her innocence or describe how she was a victim of multiple brutal rapes.\\" The husband, who asked to remain unnamed, spoke to CNN senior Arab affairs editor Octavia Nasr. His wife, who he said is \\"a quiet, simple person who does not bother anyone,\\" is ill and too fragile to speak about the case, he said. As her guardian under Saudi law, he is standing up for her publicly.  Watch the victim's husband speak out ». The attack, trial and sentencing have taken a heavy toll on his wife's already-poor health, he said. She suffers from anemia, a blood disorder and asthma, and will have surgery next month to remove her gallbladder, he said. \\"Since the attack, she's been suffering from severe depression.\\" The events ended her pursuit of an education past high school, he said. \\"Her situation keeps changing from bad to worse,\\" he said. \\"You could say she's a crushed human being.\\" \\"The court proceedings were like a spectacle at times,\\" he said. \\"The criminals were allowed in the same room as my wife. They were allowed to make all kinds of offensive gestures and give her dirty and threatening looks.\\" Of the three judges at the trial, one of them \\"was mean and from the beginning dealt with my wife as guilty person who had done something wrong,\\" he said. \\"Even when he pronounced the sentence, he said to her, 'You were involved in a suspicious relationship, and you deserve 200 lashes for that,' \\" he said. The judge dismissed her lawyer, Abdulrahman al-Lahim, after the two clashed in court, he said. \\"The judge took things personally and was reacting to our lawyer, who's a known human rights activist,\\" the husband said. \\"The judge undermined the lawyer, decreased his role and then dismissed him from the case altogether. The judge simply couldn't work with our lawyer.\\" The woman was originally sentenced in October 2006 to 90 lashes. But when she appealed, the court more than doubled her sentence. The husband said the judge was pursuing \\"a personal vendetta.\\" \\"We were shocked when the judgment changed and her sentence was doubled,\\" the husband said. \\"We were looking for pardon; instead, she got double the whipping and more jail time.\\" A court source told Arab News, an English-language Middle Eastern daily newspaper, that the woman's sentence was increased after the woman spoke to the media about the case. But a Saudi Justice Ministry statement said the permanent committee of the Supreme Judicial Council recommended an increased sentence for the woman after further evidence came to light against her when she appealed her original sentence. \\"If this sentence is based on the law, then I would've welcomed it,\\" the husband said. \\"But it is harsh, and the Saudi society I know and belong to is more sympathetic than that. I do not expect such harshness from Saudis, but rather compassion and support of the victim and her rights.\\" Saudi society is very respectful to women in general, he said. The case, which has sparked media scrutiny of the Saudi legal system, has drawn a strong international reaction. Human Rights Watch said it has called on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah \\"to immediately void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer.\\" Under law in Saudi Arabia, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition on driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. Women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man, and they are not allowed to vote. The Saudi government recently has taken steps to better the situation of women in the kingdom, including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases, adoption of a new labor law and the creation of a human rights commission.

Question 1 is asking for both the pros (positive aspects) and cons (negative aspects) of being a psychologist, while Question 2 is specifically asking for the cons (negative aspects) of being a psychologist. To answer both questions, I will provide the pros and cons of being a psychologist, and then focus on the cons. Question 1: What are the pros and cons of being a psychologist? Pros of being a psychologist: 1. Job satisfaction: A career in psychology offers professionals the opportunity to help others improve their mental health. There is a sense of fulfillment in seeing clients make progress and find solutions to their issues. 2. High demand: The demand for psychologists is growing due to increased awareness of mental health issues and the importance of mental well-being. This demand is likely to remain strong in the future. 3. Flexibility: Psychologists have the choice of working in various settings, such as schools, hospitals, private practice, or research institutions. This flexibility allows professionals to select a work environment that best suits their needs, though this might vary depending on the level of education and experience. 4. Intellectual stimulation: A career in psychology involves continuous learning and research. Psychologists must stay updated with the latest research findings, therapeutic models, and theories. This presents an opportunity for lifelong intellectual growth. 5. Multiple subspecialties: Psychology offers a range of specialized areas, including child and adolescent psychology, neuropsychology, forensic psychology, and more, allowing professionals to focus on their specific interests. Cons of being a psychologist: 1. Extensive education and training: To become a licensed psychologist, individuals must complete a doctoral degree, which typically takes 5-7 years, in addition to a Bachelor's degree. This can be time-consuming and expensive. 2. Emotional toll: Working with clients who are dealing with challenging mental health issues can be emotionally taxing. Psychologists must develop strong coping strategies and engage in self-care to prevent burnout. 3. Bureaucracy and paperwork: Psychologists in many settings are required to comply with regulations, maintain records, and complete paperwork. These tasks can be time-consuming and may detract from the primary focus on client care. 4. Insurance and reimbursement challenges: Many psychologists must navigate the complexities of insurance billing and manage the financial aspects of their practice. Reimbursements from insurance providers can sometimes be delayed or inadequate. 5. Difficult clients: Psychologists may encounter resistant or challenging clients, which can lead to frustration and impact treatment outcomes. Question 2: What are the cons of being a psychologist? To reiterate the cons of being a psychologist: 1. Extensive education and training 2. Emotional toll 3. Bureaucracy and paperwork 4. Insurance and reimbursement challenges 5. Difficult clients These cons highlight the challenges psychologists may face in their careers. However, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before deciding if this career is the right fit for an individual."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, \\"Making No Code was all about gaining perspective.\\" Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since Ten, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album.\\" The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination, with Ament stating, \\"In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up.\\" Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles \\"Who You Are\\" (sample ), \\"Hail, Hail\\", and \\"Off He Goes\\". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was \\"a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time\\" and that \\"it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band.\\" Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between all members of the group, with Ament stating that \\"everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band.\\" On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, Bleach for about 600, the band achieved huge...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the band that achieved huge commercial success with its second album, Nevermind?

The statement focuses on the communication methods and potential security risks associated with connected cars, while the question specifically asks about the uses of onboard microphones in cars with built-in voice recognition features.  I will provide a detailed and long answer to the given question. In-car voice recognition systems are designed to provide convenience to the driver and passengers by facilitating hands-free communication, control of various in-car features, and improving overall safety. Onboard microphones are an integral part of such systems, and they are used for various purposes, including: 1. Voice commands: Microphones capture voice inputs from the driver or passengers, allowing them to interact with the car's infotainment system, climate control, and other features without having to physically touch any controls. This hands-free mode can help improve driver focus, leading to safer driving. 2. Phone calls: Hands-free calling functionality is a common feature in modern cars. Onboard microphones are used to enable clear communication between the driver and the recipient during a phone call. In this case, microphones help eliminate distractions while driving, as the driver does not need to hold the phone. 3. Voice assistants: Some vehicles are equipped with an AI-powered voice assistant, such as Siri, Google Assistant, or Amazon Alexa. Onboard microphones allow these voice assistants to hear and understand spoken questions or commands, providing relevant information or executing tasks accordingly. 4. Voice biometrics: Some advanced cars feature voice biometric security systems that use the owner's unique vocal patterns as a key. The onboard microphones can record voice samples for authentication purposes, only granting access to authorized users. 5. Audio recording for incident evidence: Onboard microphones, when paired with other sensors, can record and store audio during events such as accidents or theft attempts. This can help capture any sounds or conversations during the event, which might be useful for insurance claims or police reports. 6. Entertainment purposes: Some modern vehicles come with advanced karaoke systems or other interactive entertainment features that utilize onboard microphones. Users can sing along to their favorite songs or engage with other forms of voice-based entertainment while on the road. 7. Noise-cancellation: Advanced cars may use onboard microphones to analyze the noise level and provide an active noise-cancellation system to create a quieter cabin environment, making the ride more comfortable for passengers. In summary, the onboard microphones in cars with built-in voice recognition features allow for various practical applications, from hands-free communication and enhanced control to safety and entertainment. These functions aim to make driving more efficient, convenient, and safe for both drivers and passengers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The moment you step inside, you're greeted with a warm, cozy atmosphere and it feels like a trip straight to Italy. Our server was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, guiding us through the menu and helping us make selections based on our preferences. The freshly baked garlic bread was a heavenly start to our meal, and the exquisite lobster ravioli was an absolute delight, with the flavorful and rich creamy sauce creating a perfect balance of tastes. The enchanting ambiance, top-notch service, and mouthwatering dishes make this unassuming Italian restaurant a must-visit for all food lovers!

This film is a jolt of punk rock fun, from start to finish. The Ramones, reigning princes of late-70s Punk rock, appear as themselves. PJ Soles stars as Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for the Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps the school rockin', and encourages her fellow-students to join her in her jubilant antics. Meanwhile the school that Riff attends, has just hired a brand-new Principal, named Ms. Togar. She's a tall, intimidating Amazon of a woman. And she vows to make the students 'toe-the-line'. She even has a couple of the students act as monitors, who report back to her with dirt on their classmates. Ms. Togar is especially determined to nab Riff, and put a stop to Riff's anarchic shenanigans. But Riff has clever ways to foil Togar, at every turn. Kudos to the superb performance of Mary Woronov, in her role as Principal Togar. Mary is a legendary B movie actress. And in this film, she plays the fascist Ms. Togar, with sneering relish. PJ Soles as Riff, turns in an electrifying performance. Clint Howard as the duplicitous Eaglebauer, has lots of fun with his role. The Ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film. And so the viewer sees why the Ramones were so influential, in the 70s Punk rock scene. Certainly, this is a good film for Ramones fans. But even if you're not into the Ramones, or Punk rock, this movie is a terrific blast (literally) of energetic fun. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Almost fell when I walked in. The floor was covered with water. No mats inside or out. It didn't take long before I realized the floor had been mopped with cooking oil. I'm not kidding. People were slipping and sliding all over the place. Kids were doing the splits letting their shoes slowly slide apart. I know this was brought to the manager's attention, but he did nothing. I was amazed at their total lack of care and concern. I wonder how many broken hips can be attributed to this place.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This may seem obvious, but feeding your dog is absolutely essential both to your relationship and the health of your dog.  The first week your dog is in your home, try feeding it from your hands. This will encourage the dog to trust you. Let your dog watch you fill their food and water bowls. They will associate you with food and understand that you are providing for them. Feed your dog at specific times during the day rather than leaving food out all day. This is a good way to help your dog build a routine and to further associate you with food and caring for them. There are many different types of dog food. Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation if you are unsure of what to choose. Some dogs are pickier than others and prefer certain types of dog food over others. It may take a few tries to find a food that your dog likes. Treats are a great way to motivate your dog to do tricks or to reward them for good behavior. Give treats in moderation to keep your dog at a healthy weight. A healthy dog is a happy dog! Good preventive medical care helps them live a longer happier life.  Make sure your dog is up to date on vaccinations and worming. If your dog does have medical problems, their medical care can become very expensive. Pet medical insurance is one option to help moderate your costs.  When you have a strong bond with your dog, your dog will begin to understand that you are concerned about their health and wellbeing when it comes to medical procedures or vet visits. Your dog will need plenty of exercise to keep healthy and spending time together walking is a good way to bond with your pet. Again, they will associate you with going on walks, which many dogs find to be their favorite activity!  Purchase a good quality leash. If you have a larger dog that is strong, you may want to consider buying a harness or a head halter to attach to a leash. Take your dog out regularly for good long walks. Train them to behave appropriately on a leash. They should not be pulling you along the road. They should heel and stay close by your side and walk at your pace. Take your dog to the dog park and let them socialize with other dogs and people. Your dog can bond and meet new friends while they enjoy being outside and running free. Always clean up after your dog and carry plastic bags on your walks to dispose of your dog’s waste. Try taking your dog to new and exciting places on your walks to keep it engaged. For example, you can go to a new park, garden, trail, or downtown street. Depending on the breed of your dog, they may require more frequent or complicated grooming.  Generally, try to brush your dog’s fur at least once a week to prevent knotted, matted hair. Give them baths. Some dogs love baths, some are not such big fans. Wash them at least once a month, or whenever they are muddy or dirty.. If you use a gentle shampoo, you can bathe your dog up to once a week. Depending on the breed, you may need to take your dog to the groomers so they can give your dog hair cuts that are appropriate for the breed. Trim your dog’s nails. Like humans, dogs’ nails grow continuously. Unless your dog is very active and wears them down on pavement or concrete, you will need to trim their nails when they become long. There are special dog nail clippers, but regular nail clippers can be used as well. Summary:","output":"Feeding your dog and taking care of their health is very important for their happiness. Give them food, water, and treats so they trust you and know you care for them. Take them to the doctor for shots and checkups to keep them healthy. Dogs also need exercise, so go for walks and play together outside. Brush your dog's fur and give them baths to keep them clean. Sometimes, dogs need haircuts or nail trims to stay nice and tidy. By doing these things, you can make your dog happy and healthy!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does expensive food always taste great? Would you rather be filthy rich and live 400 years ago or be poor but live today? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick your answer from:  a). no.  b). yes.","output":"a). no. These two questions are asking for different types of information and are not related.  The first question, \\"Does expensive food always taste great?\\" is inquiring about the correlation between the price of food and its taste, whether high price equals to high-quality taste. This is a subjective question as people's opinions could differ based on their personal experiences and preferences. The second question, \\"Would you rather be filthy rich and live 400 years ago or be poor but live today?\\" is a hypothetical scenario where the individual is asked to choose between a prosperous lifestyle in the past or a poor lifestyle in the present. It primarily seeks to understand the respondent's judgment about the importance of material wealth versus living in a more modern era, considering various factors such as advancements in technology, medical services, human rights, etc. Notably, it might invoke thoughts about the historical context of 400 years ago, the quality of life then and now, and the perceived value of money and time.  So, these two questions are distinct, each addressing different being and carry different implications. Whereas the first seeks to assess personal views on the relationship between the cost and quality of food, the second focuses on decision making related to wealth, lifestyle, and time periods.

Write an article based on this summary: – Central Illinois is reeling after a Saturday rash of at least 22 tornadoes crushed houses, tore up trees, and took down power lines, CNN reports. It \\"feels like I woke up to a nightmare,\\" says a man in Taylorville, the hardest-hit town. Officials say 21 people were hospitalized there, one critically, and crews responded to over a dozen houses that contained trapped people, per ABC News. At least 30 injuries have been reported, but no fatalities. Illinois averages 47 tornadoes annually, usually peaking in May, but a strong cold front set up \\"the perfect conditions\\" for Saturday's blitz, says CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Tornadoes have been moving east in recent decades from Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas to states on and east of the Mississippi River—including Illinois, the AP reports. Sadly, that means tornadoes are forming more often in more populated areas. Why the change? \\"We don't know,\\" says Victor Gensini, who lead a study on the subject. \\"This is super consistent with climate change.\\" Seems the Great Plains are drying out, providing less moisture to create storms that trigger tornadoes, while a line of dry, tornado-producing air is moving east. \\"This is what you would expect in a climate change scenario, we just have no way of confirming it at the moment,\\" says Gensini. (See more about Gensini's study.)","output":"Once upon a time, in Central Illinois, a very scary thing happened on a Saturday. Lots and lots of tornadoes appeared, 22 of them to be exact! They were very strong and caused a lot of trouble. They smashed houses, broke trees, and even knocked down power lines! The news, like CNN and ABC News, talked about this terrible event.  One man in a town called Taylorville felt like he woke up in a nightmare. Poor Taylorville had the most damage from this storm, and many people got hurt. They had to go to the hospital, and some even got trapped in their houses. But don't worry, no one died from the tornadoes. Now, you may be wondering why there were so many tornadoes. Well, Illinois usually has 47 tornadoes each year, but most of them happen in May. This time, something called a cold front helped create the perfect conditions for the tornadoes to happen in November. A scientist named Victor Gensini found out that tornadoes are not only appearing more often, but they are also moving from places like Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas to states closer to Illinois where there are more people living. Why is this happening? Well, it might be because of something called climate change. Some parts of the country might be getting drier, so the weather is changing and causing storms in different places. However, even the smartest scientist can't confirm this for now, but they are studying very hard to learn more about it. In the meantime, people are trying to clean up the mess and help each other to make things better again."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Many critics point out that the humor falls flat, with several gags being deemed uncreative and predictable. The law of diminishing returns seems to be in effect, with the movie's quality declining in comparison to previous installments in the series. Additionally, reviewers mention that performances and scenes feel unpolished, hastily thrown together, and lackluster, contributing to an overall sense of mediocrity. Some critics find a few redeemable aspects, such as a couple of inspired jokes and the beginning scene featuring Dr. Phil and Shaq, but these highlights are largely overshadowed by the movie's shortcomings. One noteworthy positive aspect mentioned by a reviewer is Anna Faris' ability to maintain her dignity and a straight face throughout the film despite the unimpressive material she has to work with.

The main concept is the same: both sentences are presenting a list of female athletes from particular countries who are considered favorites in their respective field. However, it is crucial to rectify the mistake in the second sentence regarding the countries of the athletes to make it a more accurate paraphrase.

Next question: giant three-headed guard dog in harry potter and the philosophers stone?","output":"The question seems to reference the character of Fluffy in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter Series, specifically in \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\\" which is the first installment in the series. Fluffy is a gigantic three-headed dog that is initially used by Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, to guard the Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stone, a legendary alchemical substance with magical properties, is the target of the primary antagonist, Lord Voldemort, who seeks immortality.  This menacing creature is inspired by the mythical creature Cerberus from Greek mythology, a three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the Underworld. With each of its heads looking in different directions, Fluffy presents an almost impossible obstacle for anyone who dares to steal the Philosopher's Stone.  Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures teacher who has a fondness for magical creatures, buys Fluffy from \\"a Greek chappie\\" he meets in a pub. His role is kept a secret until about halfway through the book, where Hagrid unwittingly spills the clues about how to calm Fluffy (by playing music) to a stranger cloaked in a hood, not knowing that he is giving tips to Professor Quirrel/Voldemort, the person trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone. In a daring mission, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley manage to get past Fluffy using the clue Hagrid unintentionally provided. They play a magical harp that instantly puts Fluffy to sleep, thus granting them access to the trapdoor under him, which leads to the trials set up by the teachers of Hogwarts to protect the stone. Despite his terrifying appearance, the fact that music can make him fall asleep highlights a humorous aspect of his character. At the end of \\"The Philosopher’s Stone,\\" Fluffy is released into the Forbidden Forest around Hogwarts. As the series goes on, other characters often mention Fluffy, even though he does not physically appear again. Therefore, to sum up, Fluffy is a giant three-headed dog featured in “Harry Potter and The Philosopher’s Stone,” used to guard the Philosopher’s stone. His existence in the narrative brings an element of danger, suspense, and humor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They both indicate that the Dorset and Wilts U20 team participated in the U20 County Championship competition in 2011 and won three of their four matches.  The main difference between the two sentences is the order in which the information is presented: 1. In the first sentence, the team is mentioned first (U20 Team of Dorset and Wilts 4), followed by their performance in the competition (won and played 3). 2. In the second sentence, the year and competition are mentioned first (In 2011 the Dorset and Wilts U20 side), followed by the team's performance (played 4 and won 3). However, it is important to note that the first sentence is not very clear or grammatically correct. It says \\"won and played 3,\\" which does not make clear what \\"3\\" refers to - matches, games or something else, and it should technically mention the team played 4 matches instead. To improve the clarity and correctness of the first sentence, one could rephrase it to better match the second sentence:  \\"In 2011, the U20 Team of Dorset and Wilts played 4 matches and won 3 in the U20 County Championship competition.\\" With this modification, it is evident that both sentences bear the same meaning with only a slight variation in the structuring of the information."},{"instruction":"Question: Process: - People breathe and expel carbon dioxide - Engines produce carbon dioxide - Living things produce waste - Waste decomposes - Decomposition produces methane - Water evaporates - Water vapor joins the atmosphere - Carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane are greenhouse gases -   Question: suppose more spore grow hyphae happens, how will it affect MORE greenhouse gases.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"A: more"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the subject, verb, and object: The subject of the sentence is \\"the writers,\\" the verb is \\"believe,\\" and the object is \\"the boy.\\" 2. Check if the subject agrees with the verb and if the verb matches the object: Since \\"writers\\" is a plural subject and \\"believe\\" is a verb that can have a plural subject, this matches. The verb \\"believe\\" also matches the object \\"the boy\\" as it is reasonable for writers to believe in someone or something. 3. Analyze the adverb and modal verb: The adverb \\"so\\" adds emphasis to the verb \\"believe,\\" indicating a strong belief. The modal verb \\"could\\" shows that it is possible, but not certain, that the writers believe the boy. Based on this analysis, the sentence \\"The writers could so believe the boy\\" appears to be syntactically and semantically acceptable.

To do this, we can first subtract 36 from both sides of the equation. Original equation: 0 = 18*z + 36 Subtract 36 from both sides: -36 = 18*z Step 2: Divide by the coefficient of z Now we have an equation that looks like this: -36 = 18*z To get z alone, we need to divide both sides of the equation by its coefficient, which is 18. -36 = 18*z Divide both sides by 18: (-36) / 18 = z Step 3: Simplify the fraction (if necessary) Now we have a simple equation: -36 / 18 = z We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator (-36) and the denominator (18) by their greatest common divisor, which is 18. (-36) / 18 = (-2) * 18 / 18 (-2) * 18 / 18 = -2 Step 4: Write the final result Now we have the simplified equation: z = -2 So the solution to the given equation 0 = 18*z + 36 is z = -2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mahjong, that favorite pastime of \\"old folks\\" in Shanghai, is finding a new audience among younger players, and many university students are becoming mad about this traditional Chinese game. Students at Fudan University have even formed a Mahjong club. This resurgence of the game, however, is not without its critics. Some people still associate the game with gambling and for many years Mahjong was banned in China. One critic, surnamed Meng, was quoted as saying, \\"Mahjong is a bad custom that will distract students from studies.\\" But Yu Guangyuan, former vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , says Mahjong is a \\"healthy, scientific, friendly mind game.\\" Mr. Yu's opinion seems to be shared by the majority of Chinese. They see the game as an activity that requires great concentration and intellectual skill. They also see the game as an important part of Chinese culture and a pastime that brings family and friends closer together. This Spring Festival many families will no doubt spend hours around the Mahjong table getting reacquainted with each other. For them, playing Mahjong is a way of spending quality family time. No one knows who invented Mahjong. Some say it was Confucius, others say the current form of the game was developed right here in Shanghai in the late19th century. It is certainly because of Shanghai that the game enjoys its worldwide popularity. It was brought to America in the 1920s and has since spread throughout Europe and other parts of Asia. There is now a World Championship of Mahjong which is held every year. This year's championship was held in Chongqing and attracted players from America, Europe and Russia, as well as students from Peking University, Tshinghua University and Nankai University.

I was looking to take my lil pup, my lil Pup pup, my lil coco puff, my chito to a new vet. Because O-M-G he is a line backer now at his 11 years of human years. Okay so I was looking for a new vet and decided, \\"Hey! Wait why not look on Yelp for good reviews around my zip code?\\" So I found this one and saw there was only two reviews, I decided to give it a shot. Get it? a shot? I drove to the location and it was seriously not hard to find, keep in mind everyone that the animal hospital looks like a house in the woods. They have good parking and the parking goes around the little lodge so that's cool since I missed the first entrance.   I walk in and the secretary greets me and my pup pup as do the other nice client waiting to treat her doggy. Get it? Another joke! okay I will stop now. She asked me to fill out the paper work, it was three pages, which I liked because it allowed me to give a detailed history. Oh yeah! before that when I called in the first place they asked me about my previews vet, I think because they can track down my dogs visits else where. So I fill everything out and see that there is a question that asked me, \\"How were you refereed here?\\" So this is where I take advantage of my Yelp powers! I write down, \\"I heard about this location through your great Yelp reviews.\\" Now I am not saying that if you write that down anywhere that you will get great treatment, or maybe it was just great service. I think It was great service because it was all young women working there, and they all had a great ambiance with that place going too.    Now the vet nurse calls me to way my coco puff and wow... he is a heffer. Now we walk in I explain that he has been limping for three weeks now, and I want to know, before putting him on a diet, if it is a result of him injuring himself, or of him being related to Chris Farley. She tells me that we will need to take a urine sample, blood test, x-ray. But before that the Vet walked in and felt his leg and was some what hesitant to try to push on the X-ray. Weird huh? Who does that at Vet places? It seems, to me they are always trying to push the X-ray agenda. So we agreed to everything and comes out that he has arthritis I was sad when I found that out, but at least now I knew. So explained if they could recommend a diet for him, she said she will give me a Pamphlet. So at the end of the x-ray and the procedure the nurse came out with a folder with everything neatly sorted for my dogs diet. Moral of the story?

The man, who is believed to be a local homeless person, scaled an 80-foot tree outside a Macy's store downtown and appeared to have no intention of coming back down.  It all began on Tuesday around 11 am when the man climbed the towering sequoia, managing to spend the night amidst the chilly temperatures. In a bizarre sequence of events, the man pelted police officers and medics with an apple, pine cones, and branches, according to the Seattle Times.  Initially, the police closed off streets within the vicinity. On Wednesday, however, they had no choice but to reopen the roads, keeping a close eye on the situation. The man, who claimed to be carrying a knife, appears to be suffering from a mental health crisis, and the top priority of the authorities is ensuring his safety. While the standoff continued, KOMO began live-streaming the event, garnering much attention. As reported in the Seattle Times on Tuesday, a witness described the scene: \\"The climber has just been up in the tree for a few hours now, cussing at people and throwing pine cones.\\" In an attempt to coax the man down from the tree, Phoenix Jones, a local superhero, arrived at the scene, offering the climber a sandwich and a beer. The man did not respond to the gesture and remained perched in the tree, Q13 reports. As the strange standoff unfolded, the hashtag #ManInTree took the internet by storm, becoming an instant sensation. According to the Daily Dot, multiple spoof Twitter accounts were created, with accounts dedicated to the climbing man, a firefighter who climbed a ladder to try to talk to the man, and even the tree itself. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports that the event quickly went viral, leaving many to wonder about the mental state of the man and the difficulties faced by the local authorities in addressing this unique situation. The standoff between the man and authorities in Seattle serves as an example of how unpredictable and challenging situations can be when dealing with mental health crises in public spaces. The man's story has gained widespread attention – both from serious news outlets and curious internet users. As authorities continue to try to figure out the best course of action to coax the man down from the tree, it remains clear that their priority is the man's safety and well-being. Ultimately, the outcome of this standoff will depend on the actions taken by local authorities and their ability to handle this unique and unusual situation. Whether the resulting discourse focuses on mental health issues or city planning, there is one thing that is certain: the curious case of the man in the tree will not be quickly forgotten by the people of Seattle and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To understand this, let's first examine the content of both sentences. Sentence 1 states that Mrs. Inglethorp may have accidentally taken an overdose, but three or four doses would not have caused death. This implies that there is some doubt or uncertainty about the cause of her death, raising the possibility of an accidental overdose. Sentence 2 states outright that the person was murderered. This sentence assumes that Mrs. Inglethorp's death was not accidental but rather a deliberate act committed by someone else. It is important to differentiate between entailment and implication. Entailment refers to a relationship between two sentences, where the truth of the first sentence guarantees the truth of the second sentence. In this case, the truth of Sentence 1 (that Mrs. Inglethorp may have taken an accidental overdose) does not guarantee the truth of Sentence 2 (that this person was murdered). However, the two sentences imply a connection as they both discuss the cause of Mrs. Inglethorp's death. Based on the information provided in Sentence 1, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether Mrs. Inglethorp's death was an accidental overdose or murder. In conclusion, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence because Sentence 1 does not guarantee the truth of Sentence 2. Instead, the two sentences imply a connection in subject matter and suggest that there is uncertainty about the cause of death. Therefore, the appropriate response to the question is: 2) it is not possible to tell."},{"instruction":"Q:Given this review: \\"Cyka Blyat Unfortunately  Google Play services has stopped.\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you have proposed is that, even if the stove is assumed to be working properly, there may be a situation where there is no working stove. To address this hypothesis, let's analyze its potential effects (direct or indirect) on the given process step by step. 1. Oil is gathered through mining operations: The absence or presence of a working stove will not affect this step, as it involves the extraction of oil, which is independent of the appliances that use it. 2. The oil is transported to stores: Similarly, the transportation of oil to stores does not depend on the condition of a stove in a home. It is a supply chain process that gets the oil to the place where homeowners can purchase it. 3. Oil is purchased by homeowners: If a homeowner does not have a working stove, they may not buy oil for use in the stove specifically. However, the overall distribution and sale of oil would still occur as other homeowners and users with working stoves or alternative oil usage requirements continue to buy oil. 4. Oil is placed into a stove in the house: This step could be directly affected by the perturbation hypothesis. If there is no working stove in the house, the homeowner won't be able to place oil into the stove.  5. The oil is lit on fire, and burns for a long time: If there is no working stove, the oil cannot be lit on fire and used to generate heat in the house. This step is directly affected by the perturbation hypothesis. 6. The warm air off of the oil travels through the house: Without a working stove, this step is also directly affected as there will be no warm air from burning oil to circulate in the house. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have direct effects on the process, specifically at steps 4, 5, and 6. These steps are all directly related to the presence and functioning of a stove within a house. However, the first three steps in the process are not directly impacted by the hypothesis, as they relate to oil extraction, transportation, and sale – aspects that are independent of an individual homeowner's stove condition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please briefly summarize this news article: What a school day looks like inside Children’s Hospital The school day lasts only one hour. Machines beep in the room. The teacher comes right to the student’s bed — though she might have to wear gloves and a mask. That’s what “school” can look like for children who are stuck in the hospital for days and weeks on end. Armed with clipboard, iPad, and hospital gown, Elaine Klingensmith led STAT through a typical school day one recent morning at Boston Children’s Hospital, where she works as a full-time tutor for Education Inc. The nonprofit organization aims to streamline what can be a frustrating process for parents: wrangling school officials to send the schoolwork — and money for tutors’ wages — so that sick kids don’t fall behind in school. Klingensmith and two tutors teach one-hour lessons to up to 20 children per day. Some are frequent visitors with chronic illnesses, while others are newcomers in the hospital for a surgery or transplant. Klingensmith started her morning on the ninth floor of Children’s Hospital. Caleb Hassan, a playful 8-year-old who suffers from cystic fibrosis, sat in a hospital bed in tiger-themed pajamas. Wearing a hospital gown and latex gloves to protect Caleb from infections, Klingensmith read a book with him and helped him calculate the perimeter of an 8-by-4 rectangle. Caleb yawned. “Can we do something different?” he asked. His reward for finishing was to watch a BrainPOP video about healthy eating. The animated series, with quizzes at the end, is among the tools Klingensmith keeps on hand in case she needs to supplement students’ schoolwork. Massachusetts requires public schools to pay for tutoring if a sick child is confined to home or hospital for at least 14 school days. Other states have different versions of that law. While some schools, like Caleb’s, are good about sending work, others aren’t. Founded at Children’s Hospital in 1995, Education Inc. now employs tutors in 46 health facilities in eight states. Tutors aren’t always certified. Klingensmith, who’s 27, is certified to teach only kindergarten through sixth grade, though she also tutors older students. Keeping kids on pace with their classmates can be tough. If the school doesn’t send work to the hospital, Klingensmith said, she calls the teacher to ask which concepts the class is studying. If she can’t get an answer, she resorts to asking the students what they last remember learning. “Sometimes they have no idea,” Klingensmith said. In that case, she falls back on the Common Core national standards, and a variety of work sheets and online programs. Parents often take on the extra role of ferrying schoolwork to and from the hospital. That’s what Napoleon Silva did when his two daughters, Christiana and Nicolette, who have cystic fibrosis, spent their latest stint at Children’s for antibiotic treatments to clear out their lungs. Klingensmith knocked on the sisters’ hospital room door at 10:30 a.m. “Noooooo!” cried 6-year-old Christiana, who had been watching the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on TV. Despite her initial protest, she quickly immersed herself in a math work sheet. Nicolette, who’s 9, worked alongside her sister in the face of various distractions. As she set to work on geometry, Nicolette’s IV pump started beeping, and a nurse swooped in to fix an occluded line. Christiana kept coloring while a nurse flushed the tube through which she receives antibiotics. Studying in the hospital has other challenges: Nicolette had to skip breakfast to prepare for general anesthesia later that afternoon, which made her more easily frustrated. “I don’t get this,” she protested, staring at a math problem about parallel lines. Nicolette said she enjoys the one-on-one attention from her tutor, but she misses science — a subject that’s often omitted in the hospital — and seeing her friends. Keeping kids connected to the classroom is key to maintaining a sense of normalcy during chronic illness, research has found. Aislynn Burns, who’s 9, has used FaceTime to videochat with her classmates during long stints at Children’s for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, said her mom, Tara Woodbury. But after spending nearly two full school years in the hospital, Aislynn had to change from a private to a public school, because it wasn’t worth continuing to pay tuition. Aislynn has done a ton of schoolwork at Children’s Hospital, including writing a biography of her favorite forefather, Benjamin Franklin. But the tutoring isn’t a replacement for school, Woodbury said: “One hour is great, believe me, but there’s six to eight hours in a school day.” Children who are hospitalized for mental health treatment face extra challenges. Hospitals often block their access to the Internet for fear of threats like cyber-bullying, so they can’t complete online assignments, said Lisa Lambert, executive director of the Parent/Professional Advocacy League, a Massachusetts-based network for families of children with emotional, behavioral, and mental health needs. And parents may not even tell the school their child is in the hospital, for fear the information will leak out, Lambert said. She said adolescents who were hospitalized after cutting themselves, for example, have returned to school to find that “everyone in the entire school knows.” Transitioning back to school after hospitalization “is always tough, not just emotionally but also academically,” she said. While younger students may be able to keep up with their classmates, high school students often can’t. Nicolette, who’s in fourth grade, is determined not to fall behind. She has already lost time: She and her sister were admitted on a Tuesday and didn’t start tutoring until the following Monday. She rattled off a list of work she has to do, including taking two tests and reading a history book. She said it was hard to focus on her lesson because her stomach hurt from skipping breakfast. “I was a little more whiny this morning,” she confessed. “[But] once you get into the work the pain starts to go away.”","output":"Inside Boston Children's Hospital, a nonprofit organization called Education Inc. provides full-time tutoring services to ensure that sick children don't fall behind in school.

Last updated at 2:16 AM on 25th November 2011. Tragic: Margaret Nicholl, pictured with her husband Richard, was thrown from her bike after hitting a pothole at 35mph. A retired civil servant was killed when she was thrown from her bike after hitting a deep pothole, an inquest heard yesterday. Margaret Nicholl, 67, was on a country ride with husband Richard, 70, when they sped down a hill. Mr Nicholl noticed five deep  craters at the side of the road and shouted a warning to his wife. Seconds later she hit one of the ruts. at 35mph and continued for several yards before falling off. She was not. wearing a helmet and suffered massive head injuries, dying ten days. later in hospital. The. inquest at Wells Coroner’s Court in Somerset heard that the potholes had. been there for at least four months and the road was overdue for. inspection. Mr Nicholl told. the hearing he and his wife had been keen cyclists for more than half a. century and usually cycled up to 4,000 miles a year. They had been cycling for three miles when they approached the hill in Shepton Montague, Somerset, at around 10am on March 12. He said: ‘As we went over the brow of the hill I saw some potholes. I was slightly ahead of Margaret and to her right. ‘I pointed with my left hand and shouted “potholes”. Within two  seconds I heard a bang and I am sure she hit a pothole. ‘I then heard a dull thud as if she had fallen off her bike. I saw Margaret lying in the road still astride her bike. I went back to her and saw she was unconscious.’ An inquest into Mrs Nicholl's death heard that along with husband Richard, the couple cycled up to 4,000 miles each year. Scene: The pothole which Mrs Nicholl hit is marked with an orange box. A drinks can placed inside indicates that the pothole was quite large. PC David Horsley, of Avon and Somerset police, went to the scene shortly after the accident and measured the gradient of the hill to be nine per cent or one in 11. He found five large potholes, with the largest measuring 39 inches (100cm) long, 19 inches (49cm) wide and three inches (8cm) deep. The final pothole - measuring 26 inches (67cm) long, nearly 12 inches wide (30cm) wide and 2.5 inches (6cm) deep - had tyre tracks in mud on it which matched those of Margaret’s bike. Phillip Kingdom, highways inspection manager for Somerset, said he was not surprised that the road was in such a bad state of repair. Mrs Nicholl was rushed to the Royal United Hospital in Bath following the pothole accident, but sadly did not survive. ‘We went through one of the most severe winters I have known. We were experiencing potholes all over the county. ‘We had 25,000 potholes last year in the county, which was a record. There was no extra money available at the time.’ Verdict: Accidental death.

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Would the air pressure inside lungs increase or decrease in state A?  Keith is a physician in a local hospital. He is treating a patient with respiratory problem. He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this.  Hint: Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. A:","output":"The air pressure inside the lungs would decrease in state A. This is because, in state A, the diaphragm contracts, leading to an expansion of the ribcage and an increase in chest volume. Consequently, the air pressure inside the lungs reduces, causing air to rush into the lungs as the patient inhales."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who wanted to complete the memorial offering to select 35 names from Watt's list of names? from the following article ?  Although Watts's plans for the memorial had envisaged names inscribed on the wall, in the event the memorial was designed to hold panels of hand-painted and glazed ceramic tiles. Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied. The subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87. He was hailed \\"The last great Victorian\\", and a memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral, 300 yards (270 m) south of Postman's Park, on 7 July 1904.On 11 July 1904 Mary Watts wrote to the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial... The answer to this question is:","output":"The full name of the person who wanted to complete the memorial offering to select 35 names from Watt's list of names is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

Step 1: Identify the main subject of each sentence - Sentence 1: MERS respiratory illness, U.S., officials - Sentence 2: First case of MERS, SARS-like respiratory illness, North America Step 2: Compare both sentences' subject matters. Both sentences' main subjects are 'MERS respiratory illness' being found in North America as well as being acknowledged by the authorities.  Step 3: Look for overlapping attributes. Both sentences describe that MERS is a respiratory illness and that this is the first occurrence being reported in North America. Step 4: Identify the differences. The only significant difference between the sentences is the geographic specificity - Sentence 1 specifically states 'U.S.', while Sentence 2 mentions 'North America'. However, since the U.S. is located in North America, we can agree that by mentioning North America it inherently includes the U.S. Also, Sentence 2 specifically mentions that MERS is a 'SARS-like respiratory illness', a detail that Sentence 1 lacks. But this detail adds more context than changing the overall meaning.  To summarize, both sentences discuss the same major topic, and there is a high level of overlap in their meanings, with minor differences in the details used to describe the subject.  Given the scale provided, I would rate these sentences as 4 out of 5 in terms of meaning overlap. There are notable similarities, but the slight differences in geographic location and description of the disease reduce the similarity score slightly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tajikistan The earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500 BCE when much, if not all, of modern Tajikistan was part of the Achaemenid Empire. Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BCE parts of modern Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of Kambojas before it became part of the Achaemenid Empire. After the region's conquest by Alexander the Great it became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern Tajikistan (the cities of Khujand and Panjakent) was part of Sogdia, a collection of city-states which was overrun by Scythians and Yuezhi nomadic tribes around 150 BCE. The Silk Road passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Wudi (141–87 BCE) commercial relations between Han China and Sogdiana flourished. Sogdians played a major role in facilitating trade and also worked in other capacities, as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers.

Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge. Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission. The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice. The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana. \\"This award came as a real surprise to me. It is truly an honor. Just being the first chair of the commission which began the implementation of the pro bono process was somewhat humbling.  Question: \\"When did L. Mark Bailey's life changed allowing him to become a judge?\\" Answer: \\"After 1975\\" Is this answer correct?  [+] no [+] yes...I think the answer is","output":"no. The user's question asks about the turning point in L. Mark Bailey's life that allowed him to become a judge. While it's true his journey started after he graduated from high school in 1975, the specific point when his life took a turn towards a career in law and eventually becoming a judge can be traced to when he obtained his bachelor's degree in 1978 from the University of Indianapolis and later a jurisprudence doctorate in 1982 from the Indiana University-Indianapolis. According to the information provided, the crucial change seems to have started with his higher education in law and subsequent entry into private practice after 1982. So, simply stating \\"After 1975\\" as an answer doesn't fully address when his life changed direction towards the judiciary. It skips over the details of his law education which are critical in context of his journey to becoming a judge."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: In what year did the titular counselor abandon his civil servant career?  Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant.

A perfect example is when the filmmaker claims \\"Saul\\" or Paul of Tarus (the writer of The Book of Hebrews He asserts) has no idea Jesus is or was a human being, this assertion is either purposely false as he accuses others of presenting, or he is ignorant of what \\"The Bible\\" says. first we can examine his misleading claim about Hebrews 8.4; which he shows a quote \\"If Jesus was on earth, he would not be a priest\\", hence right here He sets up the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise.. why? He does what most so called Bible believing people he accuses of doing, the same.. That is TAKING things out of context. verse one of Hebrews 8 is; 1..\\"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens\\" The context above is CLEARLY speaking of a Jesus who was on earth and ASCENDED into heaven after his alleged resurrection. It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context scripture. Here he offers a foundation, that \\"Paul was not aware of a HUMAN Jesus, but only one in \\"heaven\\" follow? lets see if the filmmaker is being honest; Hebrews 7; 14. \\"For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.\\" heh, didn't the filmmaker just quote from the writer of Hebrews trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a \\"Human Jesus\\"? it's likely anyways Paul didn't write Hebrews, but I will not go into that here, but The film maker asserts Paul did, and that is the premise of the point given here. It is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas, he does, but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on.

Labor Day weekend, which includes the holiday, typically marks the unofficial end of the summer season in the United States.

WWE made the announcement during its weekly “Raw” program on Monday night. Savage, who died in 2011 when he was involved in a fatal car accident, has always been a fan favorite to get inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, but a rumored rift between Savage and WWE chief executive Vince McMahon, which was carried on after Savage’s death by his younger brother Lanny Poffo, has kept him out until now. Tensions have eased, however, according to Poffo, who recalls to The Tampa Tribune how WWE recently approached him to make a documentary about his older brother, born Randy Poffo. The documentary also includes mentions of the Poffo brothers’ dad Angelo’s pro wrestling career, as well as Lanny’s. Lanny used to wrestle under the name “The Genius.” “When they came to my house to interview me for the documentary they arrived with flowers and good will. They made amends,” Poffo said. WWE aired the documentary on its eponymous digital subscription network after “Raw” on Monday. WWE also announced Savage’s longtime friend and rival Hulk Hogan would induct the Macho Man into the Hall of Fame at this year’s annual ceremony set to take place on March 28 in Santa Clara, California. WWE legends and current wrestlers reacted with overwhelming joy on social media after the announcement was made. Excited that #RandySavage is going in HOF!

There is no soothing drone, no happy chirp, no peaceful hum. These insects make some impressive and intense sounds, but it's not something I enjoy hearing. At best, it sounds sort of like an AM radio that's not tuned to anything, but more often it just sounds like high, piercing shrieks of feedback. Genuinely painful, even when listened to at a reasonably quiet volume. Answer:","output":"The mentioned review would most likely decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons. To provide a detailed analysis, let's break down the review into its different components: 1. Expectations vs. Reality: The reviewer clearly had certain expectations based on their love for insect noises and the difficulty of finding good field recordings. They expected the CD to contain soothing, happy, and peaceful insect sounds. However, their expectations were not met, since the CD did not deliver on these qualities. This mismatch between expectations and reality is a critical factor that plays against purchasing the product. 2. Unpleasant and painful experience: The reviewer explicitly mentions that instead of the desired insect sounds, the CD has rather distressing noises, like an AM radio not tuned to anything, or high shrieks of feedback. The sounds are described as \\"genuinely painful,\\" even at reasonable volume levels. This revelation about the unpleasant nature of the product will certainly deter potential buyers who seek relaxation and tranquility from listening to insect sounds. 3. Perception of product quality: A key aspect of any review is how it reflects the overall quality of the product. This particular review highlights that the product does not meet the customer's expectations and is, in fact, difficult to listen to. This assessment presents a negative image of the product, thus likely reducing potential customers' interest in purchasing it. 4. The emotional connection to the product: The reviewer initially stated that they were excited about the product and were sure they would love it. However, the product failed to deliver on their expectations, leading to disappointment. This emotional connection's conversion from excitement and anticipation to disappointment sends a strong message to potential buyers that the product may not live up to their expectations. In conclusion, the mentioned review would decrease the chances of buying the product due to the disparity between expectations and reality, the unpleasant and painful experience it offers, the reviewer's negative perception of product quality, and the emotional connection's letdown. As a result, potential customers who read this review might decide to look for alternative products with more positive reviews that meet their expectations and provide a more enjoyable listening experience."},{"instruction":"Options: [1]. happy on Taylor's behalf; [2]. empathetic to Taylor's successes; [3]. sad on Taylor's behalf; Q: Cameron turned Taylor's face towards him because Taylor was looking down and sobbing.

I haven't really been able to eat for 2 days due to the loss of my grandmother and grieving. So i stopped in here for lunch break today as its close to my job. I was in line and was waiting patiently to take my turn in line. Some young kid cuts to the front of the line with his buddy and the cashier sees him and says nothing just welcomes him to the counter and takes his order like nothing happened. Another girl decides to jump on the register by the door ans screams out next ...i look to see if the guy in front of me is going to go and she yells out looking at me ..come on who's next lets go. I walk up and ask her for a hamburger meal with avocado and a chocolate shake. She says do you want fries with that.... i say ..yes i just told you i wanted the meal. She replies with you obviously need to speak up because i didn't hear you....she then is banging away on her register to show me she is irritated with me then snaps at me and says what size shake do you want....i tell her small and she makes me repeat it again.  She tells me the total and snatches the 20.00 out of my hand and gives me back the change.

Today, it is popular throughout the Middle East (including Turkey), North Africa (including Morocco), and in Middle Eastern cuisine around the globe. It can be found in most grocery stores in North America.  - The Oleaceae are a family of flowering plants in the order Lamiales. It presently comprises 26 genera, one of which is recently extinct. The 25 extant genera include \\"Cartrema\\", which was resurrected in 2012. The number of species in the Oleaceae is variously estimated in a wide range around 700. The Oleaceae consist of shrubs, trees, and a few lianas. The flowers are often numerous and highly odoriferous. The family has a subcosmopolitan distribution, ranging from the subarctic to the southernmost parts of Africa, Australia, and South America. Notable members of the Oleaceae include olive, ash, jasmine, and several popular ornamental plants including privet, forsythia, fringetrees, and lilac.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City.

It has some common characteristics with the traditional cuisines of Italy, and the Balkans.  - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century.  In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region.  - A purée (or mash) is cooked food, usually vegetables or legumes, that has been ground, pressed, blended or sieved to the consistency of a soft creamy paste or thick liquid. Purées of specific foods are often known by specific names, e.g., applesauce or hummus.

The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch from the Serbia-Bulgaria border to the Black Sea.  - Olive oil is a fat obtained from the olive (the fruit of \\"Olea europaea\\"; family Oleaceae), a traditional tree crop of the Mediterranean Basin. The oil is produced by pressing whole olives. It is commonly used in cooking, whether for frying or as a salad dressing. It is also used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps, and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps, and finds uses in some religions. It is associated with the Mediterranean diet popularized since the 1950s in North America for its possible health benefits. The olive is one of the three core food plants in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat and the grape.  - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.  - The olive, known by the botanical name Olea europaea, meaning \\"European olive\\", is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, found in the Mediterranean Basin from Portugal to the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and southern Asia as far east as China, as well as the Canary Islands, Mauritius and Réunion. The species is cultivated in many places and considered naturalized in all the countries of the Mediterranean coast, as well as in Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Java, Norfolk Island, California and Bermuda.  - The Mediterranean diet is a modern nutritional recommendation originally inspired by the dietary patterns of Greece, Southern Italy, and Spain in the 1940s and 1950s. The principal aspects of this diet include proportionally high consumption of olive oil, legumes, unrefined cereals, fruits, and vegetables, moderate to high consumption of fish, moderate consumption of dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt), moderate wine consumption, and low consumption of non-fish meat products.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What area in the area that is used for hiking, hunting, and fishing was reopened for fishing in 1959?  According to the DCNR, Quehanna Wild Area is for the public \\"to see, use and enjoy for such activities as hiking, hunting, and fishing\\". The main hiking trail on the Quehanna plateau is the Quehanna Trail, a 75-mile (121 km) loop trail that passes through the wild area and Moshannon and Elk State Forests. The main trailhead for most hikers is at Parker Dam State Park to the west of the wild area. From there the trail, which is blazed in orange, heads east to the southern part of Quehanna Wild Area, skirts Piper and the Boot Camp there, then turns north, crosses Wykoff Run and turns west again. After passing through Marion Brooks Natural Area, the trail leaves the wild area and completes the loop back at Parker Dam. The Quehanna Trail is considered a strenuous hike not just because of its length, but for its 9,700 feet (2,957 m) of changes in elevation. Two blue-blazed connector trails add 30 miles (48 km) to the system, and there are many side trails and small trails off the Quehanna Highway. Most trails are open to cross-country skiing in the winter. According to the DCNR, the Quehanna Trail \\"passes through some of the most wild and beautiful country Pennsylvania has to offer\\".Susan Stranahan's Susquehanna: River of Dreams reports that before Curtiss-Wright took over the area in 1955, Quehanna was considered \\"some of the best hunting land in the state\\". No hunting or fishing were initially allowed on the leased land, but by July 1959 fishing on Mosquito Creek was allowed again, as was limited hunting to help control the deer. In October 1963 hunting resumed throughout the wild area, four years before the state purchased the land back from Curtiss-Wright. As of 2010, the Pennsylvania Game Commission allowed hunting of the following species found in Quehanna Wild Area: American crow, beaver, black bear, black squirrel, bobcat, bobwhite quail, cottontail rabbit, coyote, elk, house sparrow, raccoon, red fox, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and woodcock.

It has been declared one of the state songs of Louisiana because of its association with Davis, a country music singer and governor of the state in the years 1944–1948 and 1960–1964. Can we draw the following conclusion? You Are My Sunshine is the most popular song of 1939.","output":"While the song \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" is undoubtedly a classic and has enjoyed immense popularity over the decades, it cannot be definitively concluded that it was the most popular song of 1939. To make such a determination, several factors would need to be considered, such as record sales, chart performance, radio play, and cultural impact during that specific year.  \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" was indeed recorded by Jimmie Davis and Charles Mitchell in 1939 and has since been covered by numerous artists across various genres. However, it would not be accurate to state that it was the most popular song of that year without examining the competition. In 1939, the music scene featured several other influential and popular songs and artists. Some notable songs from the same year include \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" performed by Judy Garland from the iconic film \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"; \\"God Bless America,\\" re-popularized by Kate Smith; \\"Moonlight Serenade\\" by Glenn Miller and his orchestra; and \\"Strange Fruit,\\" a groundbreaking socially-conscious song sung by Billie Holiday. Considering these other significant songs from 1939, it's crucial to evaluate their relative popularity and impact during that time.  For instance, \\"Over the Rainbow\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1940 and has since been regarded as one of the most beloved songs in film history. Similarly, \\"Strange Fruit\\" became a symbol of protest against racial violence, playing an essential role in the Civil Rights Movement. Such examples highlight the fact that while \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" remains a popular and cherished song, it is not possible to definitively declare it as the most popular song in 1939 without a comprehensive analysis of various factors such as record sales, radio airplay, and cultural impact during that specific year. In conclusion, while \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" is a classic and significant song, it would be an oversimplification to label it as the most popular song of 1939 without considering the variety of music released during that year and how other songs and artists influenced the listening audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: “SPF” refers to a sunscreen’s “sun protective factor,” or how effectively it blocks UVB rays. The SPF number reflects the amount of time it takes to sunburn wearing the sunscreen vs. not wearing the sunscreen.  For example, an SPF of 30 means that you can spend 30 times as long in the sun before burning compared to not wearing any sunscreen at all. So, if you would usually begin to burn after 5 minutes in the sun, an SPF of 30 would theoretically allow you to spend time outside for 150 minutes (30 x 5) before you burn. However, your unique skin, your activities, and the sun’s intensity all cause variation in how effective sunscreen is, so you may need to use more than other people. The SPF number can be tricky, because its protection doesn’t increase proportionally. Thus, SPF 60 is not twice as good as SPF 30. SPF 15 blocks about 94% of UVB rays, SPF 30 blocks about 97%, and SPF 45 blocks about 98%. No sunscreen blocks 100% of UVB rays.  The American Academy of Dermatology recommends an SPF of 30 or higher. The difference between extremely high SPFs is often negligible and not worth the extra money. SPF refers only to the ability to block UVB rays, which cause sunburn. However, the sun also emits UVA rays. UVA rays cause skin damage, such as signs of aging, wrinkles and dark or light spots. Both increase your risk of skin cancer. A broad-spectrum sunscreen provides protection from both UVA and UVB rays.  Some sunscreens may not say “broad-spectrum” on the packaging. However, they should always state whether they protect against UVB and UVA rays. Most broad-spectrum sunscreens contain “inorganic” components such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, as well as “organic” sunscreen components such as avobenzone, Cinoxate, oxybenzone, or octyl methoxycinnamate. Because your body expels water through sweat, you should look for a water-resistant sunscreen. This is especially important if you are going to be very active, such as running or hiking, or if you’ll be in the water.  No sunscreen is “waterproof” or “sweat proof.” In the US, sunscreens cannot market themselves as “waterproof.”  Even with water-resistant sunscreen, reapply every 40-80 minutes or as directed on the label. Some people prefer spray sunscreens, while others prefer thick creams or gels. Whatever you decide, make sure you apply a thick, even coating. The application is as important as the SPF and other factors: if you don’t apply it properly, the sunscreen won’t do its job.  Sprays may be best for hairy areas, while creams are usually best for dry skin. Alcohol or gel sunscreens are good for oily skin.  You can also purchase wax sunscreen sticks, which are good for applying near the eyes. This is often a good choice for children, as it avoids getting the sunscreen in the eyes. They also have the benefit of not spilling (such as in a purse) and can be applied without getting lotion on your hands. Water resistant \\"sports type\\" sunscreens are often sticky, so they are not good choices for applying under makeup.  For acne-prone individual, take care in selecting your sunscreen. Look for those that are designed specifically for your face and will not clog pores. These often have higher SPF (15 or higher), and are less likely to clog pores or increase acne breakouts.  Many acne-prone individuals find that zinc oxide-based sunscreens tend to work best. Look for \\"non-comedogenic\\", \\"will not clog pores\\", \\"for sensitive skin\\", or \\"for acne-prone skin\\" on the labels. If you see any allergic reaction or skin problem, buy a different sunscreen. Repeat the process until you find the right sunscreen, or talk to your doctor about recommended brands if you have sensitive skin or allergies. Itching, redness, burning, or blisters are all signs of an allergic reaction. Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are less likely to cause allergic skin reactions.","output":"Sun protective factor (SPF) denotes a sunscreen's ability to block harmful UVB rays emanating from the sun. The SPF number measures the length of time an individual can stay in the sun without getting sunburned while wearing sunscreen, as opposed to not wearing any. For instance, an SPF 30 sunscreen allows a person to remain in the sun 30 times longer without burning. But various factors, such as skin type, activities, and sun intensity, can affect its efficacy. Protection levels do not increase proportionally with the SPF number, which means higher SPFs offer only marginal extra benefits. The American Academy of Dermatology suggests using SPF 30 or higher. SPF only signifies protection against UVB rays, while UVA rays are responsible for skin aging, wrinkles, and spots. Both UVA and UVB rays can lead to skin cancer. A broad-spectrum sunscreen provides defense against both types of rays. Broad-spectrum sunscreens usually contain both inorganic components, like titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, and organic components like avobenzone and oxybenzone. Water-resistant sunscreens are ideal for activities involving sweat and water exposure, but these sunscreens aren't waterproof and need to be reapplied frequently. Different sunscreen forms, such as sprays, creams, gels, and wax sticks, cater to various preferences, skin types, and usage scenarios. Consider the specific requirements for areas like hairy or dry skin, or when applying near the eyes or under makeup. For people with acne-prone skin, zinc oxide-based, non-comedogenic sunscreens are recommended. In case of allergic reactions or skin irritation, try another sunscreen or consult a physician for a suitable product. Ingredients like titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are less likely to cause allergic reactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Yahoo and China's Alibaba Group have agreed to a 7.1 billion deal in which the Hangzhou-based internet behemoth buys back half of Yahoo's 40% stake in the company. The agreement will give a much-welcomed cash injection to Yahoo, which has lost 65% of its value since its 2006 peak and is smarting from the resume-padding scandal of ex-CEO Scott Thompson, the third chief executive to lead the beleaguered web portal in three years. Yahoo's 40% stake in Alibaba, purchased in 2005 for 1 billion, is widely considered the company's greatest asset. But the relationship has been a fractious one, punctuated with public disagreements over company direction, as well as Yahoo siding with Google in its 2010 fight with Chinese regulators. Alibaba CEO Jack Ma publicly said in September he might be interested in buying Yahoo. \\"This transaction opens a new chapter in our relationship with Yahoo,\\" Ma said in a news release Monday. Alibaba is a leading e-commerce provider in China, the world's largest internet market. \\"Today's agreement provides clarity for our shareholders on a substantial component of Yahoo!'s value and reaffirms the significance of our relationship with Alibaba,\\" said Ross Levinsohn, interim CEO of Yahoo, in a release on the deal. Under the terms of the deal, Yahoo will get 6.3 billion in cash and up to 800 million in newly issued Alibaba preferred stock. \\"We look forward to delivering the proceeds of the near-term transaction to our shareholders, and to the further enhancement of value and the additional monetization in the future that this agreement enables,\\" said Timothy R.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: John Bruce \\"Jack\\" Thompson (born July 25, 1951) is an American activist and disbarred attorney, based in Coral Gables, Florida. Thompson is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children. Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as \\"murder simulators\\" to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. According to Thompson, \\"In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers.\\" Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, \\"If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.\\" Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as \\"Pearl Harbor 2\\". According to Thompson, \\"Many parents think that stores won't sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked.\\"  Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression, saying, \\"Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They're not even speech. They're dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it,\\" as well as simply calling video games \\"mental masturbation\\". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking \\"for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end\\". Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller \\"gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory.\\"  Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the \\"functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,\\" and \\"the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense\\". Was Thompson able to show the games influenced the defendant?","output":"No, Thompson was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who asks the family servant to kill the high-born drunken cad? ?  Sire Alain de Maletroit, plots revenge on his younger brother Edmond for stealing Alain's childhood sweetheart, who died giving birth to Edmond's daughter Blanche. Alain secretly imprisons Edmond in his dungeon for 20 years and convinces Blanche that her father is dead. Alain intends to further debase Blanche as revenge against Edmond. Alain tricks a high-born drunken cad, Denis de Beaulieu, in to believeing he has murdered a man. Denis escapes a mob by entering the Maletroit chateau by an exterior door which has no latch on the inside. Alain makes Denis a captive intending to force the delicate Blanche into marriage with him. Alain goes to the dungeon to torture Edmond with the news Blanche will be married to Denis, an unworthy rogue. After Alain leaves, Edmond asks the family servant Voltan to kill Denis before the wedding. However, Denis shows unanticipated redemptive qualities and he and Blanche fall in love. When Voltan comes to kill Denis, Blanche pleads with Voltan to spare his life and help him escape. Their attempts to escape are foiled by Alain, who then seals Edmond, Blanche and Denis in a stone cell and starts a waterwheel that presses the cell walls inward to crush them to death. Voltan fights Alain and gets the key to the dungeon and pushes Alain into the waterwheel, temporarily stopping the crushing walls. Wounded by the guards, Voltan struggles to the dungeon and, with his dying breath, gets the key to Denis just as the walls start moving in again. Denis, Blanche and her father escape the cell. Denis and Blanche decide to stay together and Edmond has the strange door removed from the chateau.

In another way, failure may be a way towards success. The \\"spider-story\\" is often told. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the English. He watched a spider making a web . The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. He tried six times. On the seventh time he made it and went on to make his web. Bruce is said to have been encouraged by this and to have gone on to defeat the English. Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one. Once he was asked why he kept on trying to make a new type of battery when he had failed so often, he replied, \\"Failure? I have no failure. Now I know 50,000 ways it won't work.\\" So what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were conditions right? Were you in top form yourself? What can you change so things will go right next time? Second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. Think about this question, \\"If I do succeed in this, where will it get me?\\" This may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway.

Frontline makes flea and tick treatments for dogs as well as cats. Make sure you use the medication designed for your pet. The dosages are sold according to the weight of the pet. Check the weight recommendations on the package and get a dosage appropriate for your pet's weight. Frontline comes with several small plastic applicators. They look something like little bottles. Each applicator contains a single dose of Frontline.  There are perforated lines between each applicator. You can separate the applicators by tearing or cutting along the perforated line. Be careful when separating the applicators. You want to make sure you do not tear an applicator and spill a dosage of Frontline. Each applicator has a small tip that you can easily snap off. You must snap off the tip prior to applying Frontline to your dog or cat.  Make sure to do this away from your face to avoid getting the chemicals in your eyes. If the tip does not come off easily, you can use scissors to cut it off. You should apply Frontline on your pet's back, directly between your pet's shoulders. Frontline is safe to use on a pet's skin, but should not be ingested by the pet. Your pet will be unable to reach this area, preventing them from licking Frontline off. Part your pet's fur so you can see its skin. This is very important. To work effectively, Frontline must be absorbed into your pet's skin.

It was fun for the first hour, you spend most of your time in tedious battles. It has a crumby storyline, and isnt nearly as good as Zelda 64. This game shouldnt be considered an RPG, because its the worst one I've played. Answer:","output":"Based on the customer's review, it can be concluded that they were dissatisfied with the product they purchased. The use of negative language and expressions throughout their review indicates their disappointment and dissatisfaction. Let's look at the review in detail to understand why this conclusion is drawn. The customer starts with the title \\"Its all hype,\\" which suggests that the product did not live up to the expectations set by its advertising or word-of-mouth chatter. This immediately reveals their negative perception. The customer then continues by saying, \\"Its not nearly as good as I thought it would be,\\" another clear signal of dissatisfaction as the product failed to meet their personal expectations. The following statement, \\"It is an easy game with tons of tedious repetition,\\" indicates that the customer found the game too easy and repetitive, which are generally seen as negative qualities in games, especially in the scope of replayability and continuous engagement. The customer also states that the game was \\"fun for the first hour,\\" implying that any enjoyment derived from the product was short-lived and that it quickly became tedious and not fun, further solidifying the notion that they were dissatisfied. Further within the review, the customer comments that the product has \\"a crumby storyline,\\" which is another negative assessment. They compare the game unfavorably to \\"Zelda 64,\\" demonstrating that they consider other games superior and more satisfying. Finally, the strongest expression of dissatisfaction comes when the customer states, \\"This game shouldn't be considered an RPG, because it's the worst one I've played.\\" This claim not only suggests dissatisfaction but potentially frustration and severe disappointment. Overall, the negative comments and unfavorable comparisons provided in the customer's review make it evident that their experience with the product led to dissatisfaction. They lament the game's lack of complexity, the story's quality, and the gameplay's overall design. For these reasons, the customer's review can be characterized as one of clear dissatisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Ancient Rome was an Italic civilization that began on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 8th century BC. Located along the Mediterranean Sea and centered on the city of Rome, it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population) and covering 5.0 million square kilometers at its height in AD 117.  - Oliver Grau ( born 24 October 1965 ) is a German art historian and media theoretician with a focus on image science , modernity and media art as well as culture of the 19th century and Italian art of the Renaissance .  - Carolingian art comes from the Frankish Empire in the period of roughly 120 years from about 780 to 900  during the reign of Charlemagne and his immediate heirs  popularly known as the Carolingian Renaissance. The art was produced by and for the court circle and a group of important monasteries under Imperial patronage; survivals from outside this charmed circle show a considerable drop in quality of workmanship and sophistication of design. The art was produced in several centres in what are now France, Germany, Austria, northern Italy and the Low Countries, and received considerable influence, via continental mission centres, from the Insular art of the British Isles, as well as a number of Byzantine artists who appear to have been resident in Carolingian centres.  - Paestum was a major ancient Greek city on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia (southern Italy). The ruins of Paestum are famous for their three ancient Greek temples in the Doric order, dating from about 600 to 450 BC, which are in a very good state of preservation. The city walls and amphitheatre are largely intact, and the bottom of the walls of many other structures remain, as well as paved roads. The site is open to the public, and there is a modern national museum within it, which also contains the finds from the associated Greek site of Foce del Sele.  - Since prehistoric times, Greeks, Etruscans and Celts have inhabited the south, centre and north of the Italian peninsula respectively. The very numerous Rock Drawings in Valcamonica go back to 8,000 BC, and there are rich remains of Etruscan art from thousands of tombs, as well as rich remains from the Greek colonies at Paestum, Agrigento and elsewhere. Ancient Rome finally emerged as the dominant Italian and European power. The Roman remains in Italy are of extraordinary richness, from the grand Imperial monuments of Rome itself to the survival of exceptionally preserved ordinary buildings in Pompeii and neighbouring sites. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, in the Middle Ages Italy, especially the north, remained an important centre, not only of the Carolingian art and Ottonian art of the Holy Roman Emperors, but for the Byzantine art of Ravenna and other sites.  - Modernity is a term of art used in the humanities and social sciences to designate both a historical period (the modern era), as well as the ensemble of particular socio-cultural norms, attitudes and practices that arose in post-medieval Europe and have developed since, in various ways and at various times, around the world. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from fashion to modern warfare), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics .  - Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.  - The Greeks or Hellenes are an ethnic group native to Greece, Cyprus, southern Albania, Turkey, Sicily, Egypt and, to a lesser extent, other countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. They also form a significant diaspora, with Greek communities established around the world.  - The Holy Roman Emperor (historically \\"\\" \\"Emperor of the Romans\\") was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect (\\"imperator electus\\") was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Pompeii was an ancient Roman town-city near modern Naples, in the Campania region of Italy, in the territory of the comune of Pompei. Pompeii, along with Herculaneum and many villas in the surrounding area, was mostly destroyed and buried under of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The stone carvings of Val Camonica (Camonica Valley) are located in the Province of Brescia, Italy, and constitute the largest collections of prehistoric petroglyphs in the world. The collection was recognized by Unesco in 1979 and was Italy's first recognized World Heritage Site. Unesco has formally recognized more than 140,000 figures and symbols, but new discoveries have increased the number of catalogued incisions to between 200,000 and 300,000. The petroglyphs are spread on all surfaces of the valley, but concentrated in the areas of Darfo Boario Terme, Capo di Ponte, Nadro, Cimbergo and Paspardo.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.  - Ravenna (also locally ) is the capital city of the Province of Ravenna, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. It was the capital city of the Western Roman Empire from 402 until that empire collapsed in 476. It then served as the capital of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths until it was re-conquered in 540 by the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. Afterwards, the city formed the centre of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna until the invasion of the Lombards in 751, after which it became the seat of the Kingdom of the Lombards.  - Etruscan art was produced by the Etruscan civilization in central Italy between the 9th and 2nd centuries BC. From around 600 BC it was heavily influenced by Greek art, which was imported by the Etruscans, but always retained distinct characteristics. Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (especially life-size on sarcophagi or temples), wall-painting and metalworking especially in bronze. Jewellery and engraved gems of high quality were produced.   - Ottonian art is a style in pre-romanesque German art, covering also some works from the Low Countries, northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian Hubert Janitschek after the Ottonian dynasty which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings Henry I, Otto I, Otto II, Otto III and Henry II. With Ottonian architecture, it is a key component of the Ottonian Renaissance (circa 9511024). However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty. It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early Salian dynasty, which lacks an artistic \\"style label\\" of its own. In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows Carolingian art and precedes Romanesque art, though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden. Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important monasteries, as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading vassals.  - The Celts (occasionally , see pronunciation of \\"Celtic\\") were people in Iron Age and Medieval Europe who spoke Celtic languages and had cultural similarities, although the relationship between ethnic, linguistic and cultural factors in the Celtic world remains uncertain and controversial. The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is also disputed; in particular, the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts has become a subject of controversy.

In an office-based experiment, 88 per cent of participants were found to produce their most accurate work when listening to music. The study also found that 81 per cent completed their fastest work when music was played. And it matters what type of music you listen to. For instance, if you're doing your tax returns, then classical music is the most effective as it improves maths skills. Listening to Jessie Jor Justin Bieber could also improve your speed, with 58 per cent of participants completing data entry tasks faster while listening to pop songs. During proof-reading, dance music, such as David Guetta, had the biggest positive impact with participants increasing their speed by 20 per cent compared to tests undertaken with no music at all. Dance music also had a positive effect on spell-checking with a 75 per cent pass rate compared to 68 per cent when no music was played at all. The research, undertaken by Brighton-based Mind lab International, suggests that silent offices may be the least productive.

Answer the question...where in lake superior is the edmund fitzgerald??","output":"The SS Edmund Fitzgerald, an American Great Lakes freighter, lies at the bottom of the eastern part of Lake Superior, specifically in Canadian waters, approximately 17 miles (27 kilometers) north-northwest of Whitefish Point, Michigan, USA. The Fitzgerald sank on November 10, 1975, during a severe storm when it suddenly disappeared from radar screens. Bound for a steel mill in Detroit, Michigan, the Fitzgerald was carrying 26,116 long tons of iron ore pellets when it encountered hurricane-force winds and waves of up to 35 feet (11 meters). Captain Ernest McSorley, a seasoned seaman with years of experience on the Great Lakes, had reported to a nearby ship, the SS Arthur M. Anderson, that the Fitzgerald was \\"taking on water\\" and had lost several navigation aids. At around 7:10 PM, the Anderson lost contact with the Fitzgerald, which had ultimately succumbed to the fury of the storm. The exact location of the wreck is at the coordinates 46°59′59″N and 85°06′50″W. In the days following the incident, the United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard launched a search and recovery operation, which led to the discovery of the sunken vessel using a U.S. Navy aircraft equipped with an underwater detection device called a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD). The search led to the first underwater images of the wreck in 1976. Due to its depth at approximately 530 feet (160 meters) below the surface, technical divers and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) have been utilized to explore the remains of the vessel. ROVs have documented the wreck's condition, revealing two large sections of the boat: the bow, which is oriented east to west, and the stern, which is facing southward and upside down. In 1995, the bell of the Edmund Fitzgerald was retrieved from the wreck using an ROV and replaced with a replica that bears the names of the 29 crew members who tragically lost their lives. The original bell is now housed in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum at Whitefish Point, where it serves as a memorial. The SS Edmund Fitzgerald's wreck has been the focus of scientific research, investigations, and speculation regarding the causes of the disaster. Numerous documentaries, books, and even a song by Gordon Lightfoot, \\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\\" have highlighted the freighter's tragic story, making it a symbol of the inherent dangers of maritime transit on the Great Lakes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What might be the first step of the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"The first step in the human reproductive and development process is the formation of the embryo, which occurs when a male sperm cell successfully fertilizes a female egg cell. This union takes place during the process of conception, usually within the female's fallopian tubes. To provide you with a detailed and comprehensive understanding of this first step, let's take a closer look at the events leading up to and the process of conception: 1. Ovulation: A woman's menstrual cycle plays a critical role in the process of conception. Roughly halfway through her cycle, a mature egg cell (ovum) is released from one of the ovaries, an event known as ovulation. This egg then moves into the fallopian tube in anticipation of fertilization. 2. Capacitation and Acrosome Reaction: Sperm cells, which have been deposited in the vagina during ejaculation, must first undergo a process called capacitation in which they become capable of penetrating the egg. This involves modifications to the sperm cells' membrane, rendering it more fluid and more likely to fuse with the egg. As the sperm approaches the egg, an acrosome reaction occurs, in which the enzymes stored in the sperm's head (the acrosome) are released. These enzymes help to digest the outer layers of the egg, facilitating penetration. 3. Fertilization: Fertilization ultimately occurs when a sperm cell successfully penetrates the egg's outer layers and fuses with its membrane, allowing the sperm's genetic material into the egg. The sperm's nucleus then merges with the egg's nucleus, resulting in a zygote, which contains a full set of chromosomes (46 in total) and is the single cell from which an entire individual will develop. 4. Embryo formation: The zygote begins to divide through the process of mitosis, rapidly multiplying its number of cells. As this cellular mass continues to grow, it moves down the fallopian tube and eventually implants itself into the uterus. Implantation marks the beginning of what is now known as an embryo.  In summary, the first step of the reproductive and development process is the formation of an embryo, which occurs through the processes of ovulation, capacitation and acrosome reaction, fertilization, and mitotic division. This embryonic stage will later be followed by further growth and development, leading to the formation of a fetus, birth, and subsequent growth stages such as infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Gene: Essential genes are the set of genes thought to be critical for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients and the absence of environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). What are the set of genes which are thought to be crucial for the survival of an organism?","output":"The set of genes thought to be crucial for the survival of an organism are called essential genes. Essential genes are integral for the proper functioning, growth, and development of an organism under optimal conditions, which assumes abundant availability of all relevant nutrients and the absence of environmental stress. These genes typically play vital roles in various biological processes such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, cellular metabolism, and cellular structure maintenance, among others. It is important to note that the number of essential genes varies between different organisms. In bacteria, like Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, approximately 250–400 genes (less than 10% of their total genes) are considered essential. Interestingly, around half of these genes are orthologs, or genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the number of essential genes is slightly higher at about 1,000 genes, which represents approximately 20% of their total genes. For higher eukaryotes such as mice and humans, determining the exact number of essential genes is more challenging; however, it is estimated that about 2,000 genes (around 10% of their total genes) are essential for their survival. In conclusion, essential genes are the set of genes considered to be crucial for an organism's survival under optimal conditions. The number and specific functions of these genes may vary between different organisms, but they generally play critical roles in fundamental biological processes, and their disruption could lead to severe consequences or even the death of the organism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The scope of the man's responsibility: If the man is responsible only for the area in front of the wall, he may not feel obligated to sweep behind the flats. However, if he is responsible for maintaining the entire area, it might be more likely that he would eventually sweep behind the flats. 2. Accessibility to the area behind the flats: It is unclear how accessible the area behind the flats is. If it's a restricted area or difficult to access, the man might not be able to sweep there. 3. The condition of the area behind the flats: If the area behind the flats is already clean or sees minimal foot traffic, the man might choose not to sweep there, as it may not be a priority for him. 4. Time constraints: It is also possible that the man is on a tight schedule and can only attend to the area in front of the wall, making it less likely for him to sweep behind the flats. 5. Personal motivations: The man's personal motivations and priorities could also influence his decision to sweep behind the flats or not. If he takes pride in his work and wants the entire area to be as clean as possible, he may opt to sweep everywhere, including behind the flats.

We ask you to answer the question by classifying the answer as 0 (False) or 1 (True) Q: Passage: Separation of powers in Australia -- Currently, there is no constitutional system where there is a complete separation of powers. The strict doctrine exists only in a theory -- in reality, some overlap is inevitable, though a system of checks and balances has developed. In the Westminster system, ministers (executive) are required to sit in Parliament (legislative). This is to adhere with the concept of Responsible Government. This is also present in the Australian system, being a requirement of section 64 of the Constitution. Question: is the separation of powers in the australian constitution A:","output":"In this task, you are given a passage from a Wikipedia article about the Separation of Powers in Australia.

These are all words that floated through my head while I was watching this beautiful, simple film. It is rare that a movie truly moves me, but \\"Shall We Dance?\\" accomplished that with grace to spare. Gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie-viewing history. It left me with a quiet sense of exultation, but with a small touch of sadness mixed in. And the dancing, oh yes, the dancing. Even if you are not a lover of the art, or can't put one foot in front of another, the steps displayed here will take your breath away, and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can. It was absolutely enchanting, even the parts that show Sugiyama's (touchingly portrayed by Koji Yakusho) stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous, child-like way. And yet, this film was not entirely about dancing, but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings. We witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance, a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art, and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast. Beauty. Pain. Emotion. All the love and little agonies of life are here, expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine Japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture.  Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly positive. The reviewer uses words and phrases like \\"beautiful,\\" \\"enchanted,\\" \\"delicate feeling,\\" \\"best experiences of my movie-viewing history,\\" and \\"exultation,\\" which clearly convey a strong appreciation for the film. They even mention wanting to sign up for dance classes after watching the movie, further showcasing their enjoyment. While they acknowledge a touch of sadness in the film, it's done in a positive way, emphasizing the emotional depth and range the movie offers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Though this app does achieve its basic purpose, I must say that it falls short in several areas, which is why I can only give it a 2-star rating. Firstly, upon launching the app, I noticed that the user interface isn't very intuitive. As a user, I found it difficult to navigate and comprehend. A more user-friendly design would have gone a long way in improving the experience. Secondly, the app seems to have quite a few performance issues. It takes a considerable amount of time to start, and there have been some instances where it has crashed or hung my device. These issues make the app unreliable and frustrating at times. On the positive side, the core functionality of editing the hosts file is present, and the app manages to get the job done once you work around its issues. Thus, I do see potential in the app and believe that, with some optimization, improved stability, and a more user-friendly UI, it could become a useful tool. In conclusion, com.nilhcem.hostseditor could be a handy app for editing hosts files on Android devices, but its current performance and user interface issues make it a 2-star app for me. I hope the developer will consider refining these aspects and turn this app into the exceptional tool it has the potential to be."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Meanwhile, Goat Man and Wendy have been incommunicado, which Barney points out often. On a phone call, Ellis discovers that his mother has a new boyfriend named Bennet, who is rude and disrespectful. One day, Ellis receives a letter in the mail from his long-estranged father from Washington, DC, requesting for Ellis to spend Thanksgiving dinner with him. Ellis decides to fly to Washington with Barney, who is also having Thanksgiving with his mother there. Ellis finally meets his father and his father's pregnant and kind-hearted wife, Judy. One night, Ellis gets a call from Barney telling him that he is in possession of marijuana. Ellis sneaks out for the night, but Frank finds out that he left.

Article: The old saying that practice makes perfect seems to make no sense when it comes to schoolwork. Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed. Mary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity. At the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \\"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college. \\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession   with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control. However, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills. Wherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start.

In leeches there are no septa, the connective tissue layer of the body wall is so thick that it occupies much of the body, and the two coelomata are widely separated and run the length of the body. They function as the main blood vessels, although they are side-by-side rather than upper and lower.

We often find ourselves wondering whether we have enough of each color when the need arises for printing colorful documents. But did you know you can easily test your printer cartridges at home using Microsoft Word? By creating a simple color test page, you can quickly determine if your printer has sufficient ink or toner levels and even maintain your print head if your printer isn't frequently used. In this article, we will guide you through the process step-by-step. Step 1: Open Microsoft Word Open Microsoft Word (or any similar program) on your computer. If you don't have Word, you can also use free alternatives like LibreOffice or Google Docs. Step 2: Create Four Small Rectangles Once you have a new blank document open, click on the \\"Insert\\" tab in the top menu. Select \\"Shapes\\" and then choose the \\"Rectangle\\" shape. Draw four small rectangles on the page. Step 3: Color the Rectangles Now it's time to color each rectangle. Start by clicking on one of the rectangles to select it. In the \\"Shape Format\\" tab, click on \\"Shape Fill\\" and select the appropriate color for each rectangle: - First rectangle: Black - Second rectangle: Blue - Third rectangle: Red - Fourth rectangle: Yellow Step 4: Print the Test Page With all four rectangles colored, it's time to put your printer to the test. Simply click on \\"File\\" in the top menu, then choose \\"Print.\\" Make sure that your printer is selected and print the color test document. Step 5: Assess the Results Examine the printed test page. If all of the colors have come out clearly and accurately, it means that your printer cartridges have enough ink or toner in each color. If any color appears faint or not at all, it may be time to replace the corresponding cartridge. Step 6: Save the Test File Don't forget to save your color test file for future use. Click on \\"File\\" and then \\"Save As.\\" Choose a location such as \\"My Documents\\" and give your file a descriptive name, like \\"Printer Cartridge Test.\\" This way, you can quickly find your test file whenever you need to check your printer cartridges again. Step 7: Run the Test Periodically It's a good idea to run this simple color test occasionally, especially if your printer isn't used very often. Performing the test will help work the print head, preventing clogs and ensuring that your printer is always in tip-top shape. Conclusion: It's easy to assume that your printer's ink or toner levels are sufficient until you're in the middle of an important print job and suddenly run out of a particular color. By creating a simple test file in Microsoft Word, you can save yourself from potential frustration and keep your printer in great condition.

Rebecca asked Mary to turn off her phone while in the theater, because","output":"the constant buzz of notifications and glaring light from the screen were not only a distraction to them but also to the other theatergoers around them. Mary, although initially hesitant, agreed to do so out of respect for not only Rebecca but also the shared experience of everyone present. Each member of the audience had paid to enjoy the performance and be wholly immersed in the artistic expression of the actors, the musicians, and the stage designers. The theater, well-known for showcasing incredibly talented artists, had always held a special place in the hearts of the community. It was a place where people gathered to forget their troubles, to share in the joy or pain of the characters depicted, and to embrace their shared love of the arts—an environment where every person’s focus was purely on the connection between art and life. Rebecca understood that when someone had to continuously check their phone or respond to messages or notifications, it created a disconnection from the present moment. She knew that Mary, her best friend for years, had a difficult time fully disconnecting from her phone. However, this experience at the theater meant a great deal to Rebecca, and she wanted to ensure that they could both give the performance the attention it deserved. In the dimmed lights and the hushed anticipation of the theater, being present became especially crucial. They were surrounded by a diverse group of people, each person emanating unique hopes, desires, and expectations. Some were there to escape from their daily routine and be transported to a world of endless possibility. Others sought inspiration or solace from the riveting stories being told on stage. Whatever their reasons for attending, they all undoubtedly deserved a chance to be engaged and captivated by the performance. By turning off her phone, Mary acknowledged the importance of focusing on the world unfolding before her eyes and ears, allowing herself to be wholly engaged and in tune with the actors' emotions, the vibrant music, and the artistry that went into creating such an awe-inspiring experience on stage. With her phone no longer a distraction, Mary felt the vibrations of the music in her heart and noticed the intricate details of the stage design that she may have missed if her phone had been on. Rebecca was grateful for her friend's willingness to shelve a piece of her digital life for the few hours they would spend in the theater. As the curtain drew to a close and the audience roared in applause, the brilliance of what they had witnessed was palpable. The performers had executed every line, every move, every note with precision and passion, and the audience had remained thoroughly engaged throughout. In that moment, it wasn't just about witnessing the phenomenal talent of the artists but also about honoring the shared human experience of hundreds of people being moved emotionally and unified through art. Rebecca and Mary left the theater that evening with an even deeper bond, their spirits soaring and hearts warmed from the enchanting world they had experienced together. This showed them the true value of being present in the moment—switching off their digital lives to connect authentically with each other and the world around them. By doing so, they opened themselves to the beautiful nuances, emotions, and messages that not only transcended the stage but also resonated with their souls. In the end, turning off Mary's phone served as a poignant reminder of just how powerful a theater experience could be when allowed to unfold without interruption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I liked the mood and the basic premise of the book, but the constant shifting in viewpoint between the characters and the jumping back and forth from the present to past events just made me quit reading half way. It just became too irritating and with over a year's reading to do on my bookshelf, I just couldn't justify spending any more time on it. I am sure more forgiving readers will enjoy the novel, but I personally expect a novel to be structured in a way to encourage the reader to keep reading. Unfortunately for me, it ceased to be fun and became a chore instead.This is only the third book that I have started reading and didn't finish in my entire life. It was that bad for me.

In Darwin's time there was no agreed-upon model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, \\"The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown.\\" He accepted a version of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin's death came to be called Lamarckism), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought \\"there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited\\", and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Darwin speculate might be how inheritable variations might come about in a species?","output":"Darwin speculated that inheritable variations might be produced by environmental factors.

Cybersphere uses OPL3 FM sound synthesis chip and therefore may require a use of an emulator such as DOSBox for the audio to work .  - Proprietary software is computer software for which the software's publisher or another person retains intellectual property rightsusually copyright of the source code, but sometimes patent rights.  - Overview. The player controls the \\"Vaus\\", a space vessel that acts as the game's \\"paddle\\" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same.  - Freeware is proprietary software that is available for use at no monetary cost. In other words, freeware may be used without payment but may usually not be modified, re-distributed or reverse-engineered without the author's permission. Two historic examples of freeware include Skype and Adobe Acrobat Reader.  - Skype is an application that provides video chat and voice call services. Users may exchange such digital documents as images, text, video and any other, and may transmit both text and video messages. Skype allows the creation of video conference calls.  - A ball is a round object (usually spherical but sometimes ovoid) with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles and juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles.  - A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are \\"fired\\" and \\"non-fired\\" bricks.  - A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The term \\"laser\\" originated as an acronym for \\"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\\". The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light \\"coherently\\". Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond.  - In video games, power-ups are objects that instantly benefit or add extra abilities to the game character as a game mechanic. This is in contrast to an item, which may or may not have a benefit and can be used at a time chosen by the player.

Fact 2: Biofuels are alcohols, such as ethanol or other chemicals, derived from biomass or living matter.  Given the two facts above, what produces electricity by burning? Answer:","output":"Given the two facts provided, we can deduce that biofuels, specifically alcohols like ethanol or other chemicals derived from biomass or living matter, produce electricity by burning. Biofuels are a renewable energy source made from organic materials, such as plant and animal waste, agricultural residue, and other living matter. The process of producing electricity through burning biofuels generally involves three main steps: 1. Production of biofuel: This step involves converting biomass or living matter into biofuels, such as ethanol or other chemicals. This can be achieved through various methods such as fermentation, transesterification, or thermochemical processes. In the case of ethanol, for example, the raw materials (often sugar, starch, or cellulose from plants) are broken down and fermented by microorganisms, resulting in alcohol, which is then purified and refined for usage. 2. Combustion of biofuel: Once the biofuel has been produced, it needs to be burned to release energy. This involves mixing the biofuel with air (or, in some cases, oxygen) under high pressure and temperature conditions. The combustion process generates heat, along with carbon dioxide and water vapor as byproducts. 3. Electricity generation: The heat generated during the combustion of biofuels is used to produce steam, which then drives one or more turbines connected to generators. As the steam passes through the turbine blades, it causes them to rotate at high speeds. This mechanical energy is then converted into electrical energy by the generator, which produces electricity that can be used to power homes, businesses, and industries. It is worth noting that the efficiency of electricity generation through biofuel combustion depends on various factors, such as the type of biofuel used, the combustion technology, and the overall system design. In general, the use of biofuels for electricity generation can offer benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased energy security, and support for rural economies. However, it is also important to consider potential challenges and trade-offs, such as land-use changes, food-versus-fuel debates, and the overall environmental impact of biofuel production and use."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the subject of the painting that Hans Hieronymus Imhoff gave a lukewarm description for? from the following article ?  After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of Dürer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573–74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633–58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. Dürer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \\"among the most severe losses in the Dürer oeuvre\\". In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and Dürer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and Dürer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \\"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\\".Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria.

The Residencia de Estudiantes, or student residences, is a modern environment which encourages Spain's brightest young minds. Salvador, who is determined to become a great artist, soon catches the attention of the Resi's social elite poet Federico García Lorca (Javier Beltran) and aspiring filmmaker Luis Buñuel (Matthew McNulty). Together they form the nucleus of the most modern group in Madrid. Their private lives become increasingly complex as Federico ignores the advances of devoted friend and writer Magdalena (Marina Gatell), and Salvador himself feels the pull of García Lorca's magnetism. Luis, becoming increasingly isolated by the duo's closeness, decides to move to Paris to fulfill his own artistic ambitions. Meanwhile, Salvador and Federico leave Madrid to spend the summer at the seaside village of Cadaques, at the home of Dalí's family. Federico finds himself accepted[1] into the Dalí family as he and Salvador grow closer until, one night, their friendship becomes more.[2] Even as they draw closer, their relationship appears doomed.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The trouble with any label is that it tends to reduce people to nothing more than stereotypes and hollow shells. Before you approach an otaku girl, remind yourself that she is an individual person with her own quirks, beliefs, and personality. Some of her characteristics might scream “typical” otaku, but many won't. The same thing can be said about impressing her once you've already met and started to date. There is no single set of steps that can be used on every girl who falls under the “otaku” label—including the steps listed in this article. Use the label as a starting point, but always personalize your approach based on the specific girl. Otaku girls can often be found online in chat rooms, forums, and various social media websites. Moreover, these girls are often comfortable interacting in the digital realm and can appreciate an online meeting just as well as an offline one.  Navigate forums related to anime, manga, or other aspects of otaku culture. Join active groups on Facebook or other social media websites about those topics, as well, and participate in the discussions that go on as much as possible. When you find an interesting girl, start following her on her blog or on one or two social media websites. Don't follow all of her accounts at once, though, since doing so may come on too strong and scare her away. Not every otaku girl is glued to her computer monitor, of course. The vast majority have lives in the real world, and if you want a more traditional meeting, your best bet is to track down the otaku girl in her natural habitat. In other words, go someplace related to her interests since she'd be likely to visit there in her free time. For example, try going to a store that has a wide selection of anime or manga. Spend time at an arcade. See a movie that has a large female fandom or, if you're feeling especially daring, try going to an anime convention. Once you find a girl who piques your interest, you need to make a good first impression. You don't necessarily need a flashy, witty pick-up line, though. Striking up an interesting conversation might be more than enough. Discussions about shows, movies, and related media tend to be a good place to start, especially if you see her looking at a similar series in a store. If you don't know enough about her likely interests, you could even start the conversation by confessing your lack of knowledge and asking her to make a recommendation. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to approach and impress an otaku girl, someone who is a big fan of things like anime and manga.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Polio workers come under fresh attack in Pakistan updated 10:12 AM EST, Wed December 19, 2012 Read a version of this story in Arabic. Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Health workers administering polio vaccinations came under fresh attack in Pakistan on Wednesday, a troubling development in a nation that remains one of three in the world where the disease has yet to be eradicated. Three workers were killed in separate attacks, a day after five others died in similar circumstances. All of them were part of a massive vaccination campaign nationwide. The attacks prompted authorities to suspend the campaign throughout the country. Read more: At the U.N., a vow to eradicate polio by 2015 -- Two men opened fire on an 18-year-old worker as he was vaccinating children on the outskirts of the northwestern city of Peshawar. The worker died of bullet wounds to the head, said Dr. Janbaz Afridi, the provincial director of the polio campaign. -- Gunmen opened fire on a car carrying a vaccination campaign supervisor and her driver in Charsadda -- killing them both. -- Also in Charsadda, two female workers narrowly escaped when some men began shooting at them. -- Three other female workers also escaped unhurt when they were shot at in Nowshera district. All the attacks Wednesday took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province rife with Islamic extremists. On Tuesday, five workers were killed: four in Karachi; and a 14-year-old volunteer in Peshawar as she and her sister were leaving a house after administering vaccines. Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program last year to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011. In June, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. CNN was not able to reach the Taliban for comment regarding the latest attacks. Polio, a highly infectious viral disease that can cause permanent paralysis in a matter of hours, has been eradicated around the world except for three countries where it is endemic: Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. After the number of cases spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up its eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 173 last year to 53 this year, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Q: What occurs in a population when its allele frequencies change over time?    Choices:  - variation  - generation  - extinction  - evolution  A: The answer is:","output":"Evolution When a population's allele frequencies change over time, the process is referred to as evolution. The term \\"evolution\\" generally refers to the dynamic changes that occur within a population's gene pool over a period of time. Gene pools consist of all the genes and their corresponding alleles found within a population. Altered allele frequencies in a population may lead to new characteristics or variations in that population, which can contribute to the evolution of a species. Several factors contribute to the change in allele frequencies in a population. Here is a more detailed and long explanation of some of these factors and their role in evolutionary processes: 1. Natural Selection: Natural selection is a significant mechanism driving evolution. It occurs when individuals with specific traits or characteristics that make them better adapted to their environment have a higher probability of survival and reproduction. These individuals pass on their advantageous traits to their offspring, thus favoring their presence in the population. 2. Genetic Drift: Genetic drift is another factor that contributes to the change in allele frequencies. It is a random process that involves changes in the gene pool due to chance events. For example, some individuals may not reproduce (or survive) while others may produce several offspring solely due to chance. In small populations, genetic drift has a more significant impact, which can lead to a loss of genetic variation and even extinction in extreme cases. 3. Migration: The movement of individuals between populations, or gene flow, can also cause changes in allele frequencies. When individuals from different populations interbreed, the gene pools of both populations are altered. In this way, the exchange of genetic material between populations can lead to evolution. 4. Mutation: Mutations are changes that occur in the genetic material (DNA) of an organism. While most mutations have no impact on the organism's fitness, some may give rise to new alleles that affect the organism's traits. Over time, these changes can contribute to the evolution of a population by introducing new genetic variations. 5. Non-random Mating: When individuals preferentially mate with others exhibiting certain characteristics, the frequency of those preferred characteristics may increase in the population. This process is called non-random mating or assortative mating, and it can lead to changes in allele frequencies. In summary, evolution is the process that occurs in a population when its allele frequencies change over time. Evolution can result from natural selection, genetic drift, migration, mutation, and non-random mating. These factors can contribute to the modification of a population's genetic makeup, which may lead to the emergence of new traits or characteristics and, ultimately, the development and diversification of species."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"When is the longest time difference between UK and Chile?\\"  Context: \\"Beginning and ending dates are roughly the reverse in the southern hemisphere. For example, mainland Chile observed DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March, with transitions at 24:00 local time. The time difference between the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could therefore be five hours during the Northern summer, three hours during the Southern summer and four hours a few weeks per year because of mismatch of changing dates.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we will first evaluate the time difference between the UK and Chile during the various time frames mentioned in the context. 1. Northern summer: In the Northern hemisphere, the UK observes Daylight Saving Time (DST), which usually begins in the last Sunday of March and ends on the last Sunday of October. During this time, the UK turns its clock one hour forward. Since Chile does not observe DST during this period, the time difference between the UK and Chile is five hours. 2. Southern summer: In the Southern hemisphere, Chile observes DST, which usually starts from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March, with transitions at 24:00 local time. During this period, Chile turns its clock one hour forward. The UK, however, does not observe DST during this time. Therefore, the time difference between the UK and Chile is three hours. 3. Mismatch of changing dates: There are a few weeks per year when DST starts or ends at different dates in the UK and Chile due to the mismatch in their DST schedules. During these few weeks, the time difference between the UK and Chile is four hours. After analyzing the time differences during the various periods mentioned in the context, we can conclude that the longest time difference between the UK and Chile is five hours, which occurs during the Northern summer."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: What type of apples do people prefer?

Rhyme, while found throughout the Quran, is conspicuous in many of the earlier Meccan suras, in which relatively short verses throw the rhyming words into prominence. The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers. Frequently a change of rhyme from one set of verses to another signals a change in the subject of discussion. Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The type of rhymed prose found in the Quranic book is most prominent in the earlier Meccan suras, particularly in shorter verses.

This special day is dedicated to honoring fathers, celebrating fatherhood, and the influence of fathers in society. Father's Day originated in the United States and has since been adopted by many countries around the world, including the UK. It is important to note that Father's Day is not a public holiday in the UK, so regular working hours and schedules remain unaffected. The celebration of Father's Day in the UK is similar to how it is observed in the United States. Children and families come together to express their love, appreciation, and gratitude towards their fathers, stepdads, and father figures in various ways. Common activities and traditions for Father's Day in the UK include: 1. Giving cards or gifts: Children and families often give their fathers heartfelt cards or thoughtful gifts to show their appreciation. These can range from handmade crafts and personalized items to store-bought gadgets and clothing. 2. Spending quality time together: Many families choose to commemorate Father's Day by spending the day together, participating in activities that their father enjoys — this can include watching sports, going for a walk, taking a day trip, or simply spending time at home bonding over shared hobbies and interests. 3. Having a special meal: Families might prepare a special breakfast, lunch, or dinner for their father. This could involve cooking their dad's favorite meal, eating out at a preferred restaurant, or organizing a family barbecue. 4. Sending messages of love and appreciation: For those unable to spend the day with their father, sending messages of love, best wishes, and appreciation is a common tradition. This can be done through phone calls, video calls, or social media. Father's Day can also be a day to recognize and support men who have lost their children or those who have lost their own fathers, acknowledging their experiences and offering emotional support. Since Father's Day falls on different dates globally (with countries like Australia and New Zealand celebrating it on the first Sunday of September), it is crucial to remember that the third Sunday of June is when the United Kingdom specifically celebrates this important occasion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth.  and a hint : \\"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change...

Answer:","output":"The ecosystem functions would likely be more stable in Nicaragua than in England. This is because Nicaragua has a higher level of biodiversity, which, as stated in the hint, increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time. Diverse communities, such as those found in Nicaragua, are more productive and resilient as they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and resource capture. In contrast, the lower biodiversity in England due to extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls may result in a less stable and less efficient ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. Teacher:Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: jump around left twice and turn left thrice Student:","output":"The solution would be: I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT.  Here's how I solved it:  - 'jump around left twice' means the agent should turn to the left, jump, then turn to the left again, and jump again. That's four actions in total, which translate into: I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP. - 'and' simply separates the two parts of the command, so we move onto the second part. - 'Turn left thrice' means the agent should turn to the left three times. That's three actions, which translate into: I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT. Putting these two parts together, you get seven actions: I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Asians are immigrating to Canada and the United States in larger numbers than ever believe that they can give their children a better education in the west. In Asia, especially in China, Japan, and Korea, it is difficult to go to university. Students must first pass the strict national examination. However, in Canada and the United States, it is easy to go to university, and anyone who wants to go can go. As a result, Asian parents decide to leave their countries so that their children can go to university. The problem is that when Asians arrive, they discover that finding a job and making money are more difficult in the West than in the East. Also, they find that they are very lonely, and that they miss their homes. Because of these two reasons, most Asian parents decide to go back to work while their children study in the West.

First, let's add 7513 and 382 together.

We can do that by subtracting 2688 from both sides: 7895 - 2688 = -127 * n 5207 = -127 * n Now we want to get \\"n\\" by itself. Since it is being multiplied by -127, we can divide by -127 on both sides to find out what \\"n\\" is: 5207 / -127 = n -41 = n There you go! The solution is n = -41.

The story is a flashback of the five years (2005 to 2010) of love affair involving the characters of Allan Alvarez and Mia Samonte.  The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat.  One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto. While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began.
