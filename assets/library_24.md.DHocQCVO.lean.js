Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Information:  - Tim Chandler (born February 3, 1960) is a bass guitar player, best known for his work with the rock bands Daniel Amos, The Swirling Eddies (credited as Berger Roy Al) and The Choir.  - Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music.  - Gene \\"Eugene\\" Andrusco (April 6, 1961  March 20, 2000) was a Canadian-born actor, record producer, engineer, composer and musician. Andrusco was best known as the leader of the alternative rock band Adam Again, a member of The Swirling Eddies (credited as \\"Prickly Disco\\") and as a founding member of the supergroup Lost Dogs.  - Bruce Spencer is an American drummer, drumming instructor and clinician, singer and session musicion, songwriter, record producer, best known for his work with the rock and roll trio, The 77s.  - Steve Hindalong (born November 29, 1959) is an American drummer, percussionist, songwriter and producer best known for his work with the alternative rock band The Choir. Since 2006, Hindalong has also been an official member of the alternative country supergroup Lost Dogs.  - Michael Roe (born October 12, 1954) is an American record producer, songwriter, guitarist and singer.  - Country rock is subgenre of popular music, formed from the fusion of rock and country. It was developed by rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late-1960s and early-1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. Country rock began with Bob Dylan and The Byrds, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, Michael Nesmith, Poco and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock.  - Daniel Amos (aka D. A., Dä) is an American Christian rock band formed in 1974 by Terry Scott Taylor on guitars and vocals, Marty Dieckmeyer on bass guitar, Steve Baxter on guitars and Jerry Chamberlain on lead guitars. Current members include bassist Tim Chandler, guitarist Greg Flesch and drummer Ed McTaggart. Over the band's career, they have experimented with country rock, rock, new wave, and alternative rock.  - The Traveling Wilburys (sometimes shortened to the Wilburys) were a British-American supergroup consisting of Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty. The band recorded two albums, the first in 1988 and the second in 1990, though Orbison died before the second was recorded.  - Lost Dogs are an American musical supergroup formed in 1991 , comprising vocalists , songwriters , and guitarists from multiple Christian alternative rock bands . Their current lineup includes Terry Scott Taylor ( Daniel Amos , the Swirling Eddies ) , Michael Roe ( The 77s ) , Derri Daugherty and Steve Hindalong ( The Choir ) . The original lineup included Gene Eugene ( Adam Again ) , who died in 2000 . The band 's eclectic blending of folk , blues , country , and rock has been characterized as \`\` a sort of CCM equivalent to the Traveling Wilburys '' . The band released their debut album Scenic Routes in 1992 as a one - time collaboration . Lost Dogs concert performances are filled with between - song jokes and one - liners between the band members ( usually poking fun at each other ) . Many Lost Dogs albums include at least one or two cover songs . Songs covered by Lost Dogs on an album or in concert include Bob Dylan 's \`\` Lord Protect My Child '' , Leonard Cohen 's \`\` If It Be Your Will '' , The Beatles ' \`\` I 'm A Loser '' , \`\` The Chipmunk Song ( Christmas Do n't Be Late ) '' , and Stephen Foster 's \`\` Hard Times , Come Again No More '' . In March , 2000 , shortly after the release of their Gift Horse album , Gene Eugene died . In 2004 , the band got together with Steve Hindalong to produce a special album for their summer tour . The result was entitled MUTT , and included new acoustic versions of ten songs originally written and recorded for each band member 's regular rock bands . The following year , the band would release the almost entirely instrumental Island Dreams . The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees , was released July 2006 . In 2008 , the Lost Dogs traveled down historic Route 66 with cinematographer Jimmy Abegg . Abegg filmed the band 's experiences . The band then wrote and recorded 14 songs inspired by their journey , which was released as Old Angel in May 2010 .  - A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material.  - Terry Scott Taylor (born May 24, 1950) is an American songwriter, record producer, writer and founding member of the bands Daniel Amos and The Swirling Eddies (credited as Camarillo Eddy). Taylor is also a member of the roots and alternative music group, Lost Dogs. He is currently based in San Jose, California, U.S.  - Adam Again was an American rock band founded and led by vocalist Gene Eugene, with Riki Michele on vocals, Paul Valadez on bass, Jon Knox on drums, Greg Lawless on guitar. Dan Michaels often played saxophone.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Riki Michele (born Michele Bunch, currently Michele Palmer) is a female Christian alternative music artist. She was a singer for Adam Again, and has also recorded four eclectic solo records.  - Christian alternative rock is a form of alternative rock music that is lyrically grounded in a Christian worldview. Some critics have suggested that unlike CCM and older Christian rock, Christian alternative rock generally emphasizes musical style over lyrical content as a defining genre characteristic, though the degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist.  - Ed McTaggart (born July 10, 1951) is an American drummer and artist. He is best known as the drummer of the rock band Daniel Amos.  - Christian rock is a form of rock music that promotes Jesus and is typically performed by self-proclaimed Christian individuals and bands whose members focus the lyrics on matters of Christian faith. The extent to which their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies between bands. Many bands who perform Christian rock have ties to the contemporary Christian music labels, media outlets, and festivals, while other bands are independent.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - The 77s (alternatively spelled The Seventy Sevens or The 77's) are an American rock band consisting of Michael Roe on vocals/guitar, Mark Harmon on bass and Bruce Spencer on drums.  - Jeffrey Lynne (born 30 December 1947) is an English songwriter, composer, arranger, singer, multi-instrumentalist and record producer who gained fame in the 1970s as the lead singer and sole constant member of Electric Light Orchestra. In 1988, under the pseudonyms Otis Wilbury and Clayton Wilbury, he co-founded the supergroup Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty.  - George Harrison, (25 February 1943  29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song.  - A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar. Guitarists may play a variety of guitar family instruments such as classical guitars, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and bass guitars. Some guitarists accompany themselves on the guitar by singing or playing the harmonica.  - Greg Flesch (born 1960) is a guitarist and musician, best known for his work with the rock bands Daniel Amos and The Swirling Eddies (credited as Gene Pool).  - Derri Daugherty (born October 13, 1958) is an American record producer, songwriter, guitarist and singer, best known as the lead singer and guitarist for band The Choir.  - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.   - Jerry Chamberlain is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer, best known for his work with the rock bands Daniel Amos and The Swirling Eddies (credited as \\"Spot\\").  - Roy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936  December 6, 1988), nicknamed the Big O, was an American singer-songwriter and musician, known for his distinctive, impassioned voice, complex compositions and dark emotional ballads. The combination led many critics to describe his music as operatic, giving him the sobriquet \\"the Caruso of Rock\\". Between 1960 and 1964, 22 of his songs placed on the \\"Billboard\\" Top 40, including \\"Only the Lonely\\" (1960), \\"Crying\\" (1961), and \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" (1964).  - Scenic Routes is an album by roots music band Lost Dogs, released on BAI Records in 1992.

Answer a question about this article: Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth. Many glaciers from temperate, alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt, creating a water source that is especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other sources may be scant. Within high altitude and Antarctic environments, the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater. Under what circumstances would humans require water from a glacier?","output":"To answer this question, I will first outline the main points from the article about glacial ice and its importance as a freshwater source. Then, I will identify situations in which humans would require water from a glacier. 1. Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth. 2. In various climates, glaciers store water as ice during colder seasons and release it as meltwater during warmer seasons. 3. This meltwater is important for plants, animals, and humans, especially when other water sources are scarce. 4. In high altitude and Antarctic environments, the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater. Now, I will list some circumstances in which humans would require water from a glacier: 1. In regions where the traditional water sources (rivers, lakes, groundwater) are scarce or have been depleted (e.g., during droughts), glacial meltwater could become a vital water source for human needs such as drinking, irrigation, and industrial usage. 2. In high-altitude or mountainous areas, where access to other water sources is limited, nearby glaciers can serve as a consistent source of freshwater for human consumption and agriculture. 3. In areas experiencing rapid population growth or increased demand for water resources, glacial meltwater may provide an additional source of water to help meet these increasing needs. 4. During periods of climate change, when weather patterns may affect the availability and distribution of water, glacial meltwater can serve as a more reliable water source contributing to water security. 5. Human settlements and activities in polar regions, such as research stations or exploration missions, may rely on glacial meltwater as their primary source of water, given the limited alternatives available in such extreme environments. In conclusion, humans would require water from a glacier under circumstances where traditional water sources are insufficient, scarce, or inaccessible, and during times of increased demand for water resources or changing climate conditions. This can be especially relevant in high-altitude, mountainous, and polar regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Most of Earth's major earthquakes are caused by","output":"the release of built-up stress along the boundaries of tectonic plates. Tectonic plates are massive pieces of Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and the upper mantle. These plates, varying in size and thickness, float on the partially molten, more fluid asthenosphere below. The movement of these tectonic plates is driven by the heat generated from the Earth's interior, resulting from radioactive decay and the residual heat from Earth's formation. The Earth's lithosphere is divided into approximately seven large and several smaller plates that constantly move relative to each other. There are three primary types of tectonic plate boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform. Each of these boundaries has different characteristics that contribute to the occurrence of earthquakes. 1. Divergent Boundaries: These boundaries occur when two tectonic plates move away from each other, due to the upwelling of material from the mantle. Divergent boundaries are primarily found in mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed. Although earthquakes along divergent boundaries are generally less severe than those along other types of plate boundaries, they can still cause a significant release of energy. For example, the East African Rift Valley is an active divergent boundary where earthquakes frequently occur. 2. Convergent Boundaries: At convergent boundaries, two plates collide with each other. This collision can result in the formation of mountain ranges, trenches, and volcanic arcs. Depending on the types of crust involved, convergent boundaries are further classified into three categories:   a. Oceanic-continental convergence: When a dense oceanic plate collides with a less dense continental plate, the oceanic plate subducts beneath the continental plate, forming a deep trench. The process of subduction leads to the buildup of immense pressure and stress, eventually causing the release of energy in the form of earthquakes, often along the boundary or within the subducting plate. For example, the earthquakes along the western coast of South America are largely due to subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate.   b. Oceanic-oceanic convergence: When two oceanic plates collide, the denser plate subducts beneath the other, creating a deep trench and volcanic island arcs. This type of convergence generates earthquakes, both along the boundary and within the subducting plate, similar to those seen in the oceanic-continental convergence. An example of oceanic-oceanic convergence is the region of Japan, where the Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Philippine Sea Plate, making it an area of intense seismic activity.   c. Continental-continental convergence: When two continental plates collide, they can't easily subduct due to their low density. Instead, they tend to buckle and uplift, creating mountain ranges. Earthquakes along these boundaries are typically caused by the release of stress from this compression and crustal deformation. The Himalayas are an example of a mountain range formed by continental-continental convergence, where the Indian Plate is colliding with the Eurasian Plate. 3. Transform Boundaries: At transform boundaries, two plates slide past each other horizontally, without any creation or destruction of the lithosphere. The movement of these plates is neither smooth or continuous, as their rough edges can get stuck against each other, causing the buildup of stress over time. Eventually, this stress is released in the form of an earthquake, when the plates suddenly slip past each other. The most famous example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California, which separates the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. In addition to these tectonic processes, there are other factors that influence the occurrence and intensity of earthquakes, such as the depth, structure, and strength of the Earth's crust in a specific region, as well as the presence of fault lines and geological variations. While the majority of major earthquakes are indeed caused by tectonic plate interactions, it is important to note that earthquakes can also be triggered by volcanic activity, human activities (such as underground mining or petroleum extraction), and even meteorite impacts, although these events are significantly less common."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The story goes something like this: There is the future 'victim' getting on with their quotidian activities and whoosh, they are whisked into a life of gambling, drugs, sex or junk food addiction. After years of struggle, they finally find redemption and become good people again. As in any good tale of redemption, there has to be a 'reason' for why our 'victim' fell off the rails.

And to make things worse, I was brought up Catholic! Yes folks, in today's shorthand of grievance, I'm a half-breed straddling Canada's great language divide and a religious bigot. My hometown was a mixture of French and English-speaking people and the results of their miscenagation. You could never tell by someone's last name who spoke your language (For instance, my good friend P. Arsenault spoke the Queen's English and my cousin Sean Doyle wouldn't have recognized an Oxford Dictionary if you shoved up his nose). As children, we were segregated by language; all the French-speaking kids went to one side of the school where they spoke French all the time. I was fortunate enough to be sent to the English side of the school and got to speak my native tongue. My parents decided my brother and sister wouldn't be quite so lucky. In an effort to bridge the great language divide, they both spent six years learning everything in French and mingling with the French people (My parents did this because it was the firm belief of all forward-thinking families that whatever road you took would be much smoother if you could speak both of Canada's official languages.

It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records.  Question: \\"Who coordinated the defense of US airspace on September 11?\\" Response: \\"Pilots\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: How to core an apple?","output":"Coring an apple is a simple process that removes the center part of the apple that contains the seeds and leaves the flesh intact for further use in baking, cooking, or eating. The method you choose will depend on what equipment you have available and how you plan to use the cored apple. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to core an apple: Method 1: Using an apple corer 1. Gather your equipment: You will need an apple corer, a cutting board, and a sharp knife. 2. Wash and dry the apple: Rinse the apple under running water and pat it dry with a clean towel or paper towel. 3. Place the apple on the cutting board: Position the apple with its stem facing upward, and make sure it sits flat on the cutting board. 4. Insert the apple corer: Hold the handle of the apple corer vertically and align the corer’s circular blade with the center of the apple. Apply gentle pressure and a twisting motion to push the corer through the apple. 5. Remove the core: When the corer reaches the bottom of the apple, carefully pull the corer back out, removing the core. Dispose of the core and any seeds. 6. Check and clean the apple: Inspect the cored apple for any remaining seeds or core fragments and remove them with the knife if necessary. Method 2: Using a knife 1. Gather your equipment: You will need a cutting board, a sharp knife, and a spoon or melon baller. 2. Wash and dry the apple: Rinse the apple under running water and pat it dry with a clean towel or paper towel. 3. Place the apple on the cutting board: Position the apple with its stem facing upward, and make sure it sits flat on the cutting board. 4. Cut the apple into quarters: Hold the apple steady with one hand and, using the knife, make two vertical cuts that intersect at the core to create four equal sections. 5. Remove the core: Hold each apple section with the core facing upward and use the knife to make a diagonal cut that removes the seed compartment while preserving as much fruit as possible. Alternatively, you can use a spoon or melon baller to scoop out the cores and seeds from the quarters. 6. Check and clean the apple: Inspect the cored apple wedges for any remaining seeds or core fragments and remove them with the knife if necessary. Method 3: Using a cup or a small cookie cutter 1. Gather your equipment: You will need a cutting board, a sharp knife, and a cup or a round cookie cutter with a diameter slightly smaller than the apple. 2. Wash and dry the apple: Rinse the apple under running water and pat it dry with a clean towel or paper towel. 3. Slice off the top of the apple: Hold the apple steady with one hand and, using the knife, make a horizontal cut to remove the top of the apple, just below the stem. 4. Position the cup or cookie cutter: Turn the apple upside down so the cut surface is facing downward, and place the cup or cookie cutter over the center of the apple. 5. Push the cup or cookie cutter through the apple: Apply gentle pressure while slowly twisting the cup or cookie cutter to cut through the flesh of the apple until it reaches the cutting board, leaving the core intact. 6. Remove the apple cylinder: Carefully lift the apple and pull out the apple cylinder that now surrounds the core. 7. Separate the core from the apple cylinder: Hold the apple cylinder with one hand and use the knife to make a vertical cut, separating the core from the apple flesh. Discard the core. 8. Check and clean the apple: Inspect the cored apple cylinder for any remaining seeds or core fragments and remove them with the knife if necessary. Regardless of the method you choose, once the apple is cored, it is ready to be sliced, diced, or used whole in your favorite recipes such as pies, tarts, salads, or as a healthy snack. Remember to handle knives and corers carefully to avoid injury."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What is happening to a person found guilty of committing murder? Possible A: feeling sad, going to prison, jail time, go to jail, feeling of guilt  Why is \\"going to prison\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"Going to prison is an answer aligned with human common sense because it reflects a widely understood and accepted consequence for committing a serious crime like murder. In societies governed by laws and regulations, murder is considered one of the most severe crimes that a person can commit, leading to the severest punishment in the form of imprisonment or, in some cases, even capital punishment.  There are multiple reasons why the incarceration of a murderer aligns with human common sense: 1. Protection of society: The primary objective of imprisonment is to protect society from the threat posed by an individual who has demonstrated their capacity to cause extreme harm to others. By incarcerating a murderer, the community is safeguarded from any potential recidivism or further violent acts from the perpetrator. 2. Rule of law: Prisons function as a manifestation of the rule of law and the fundamental principle that, as members of a civilized society, individuals must be held accountable for their actions. Imprisoning a murderer reinforces the idea that no one is above the law, and even the most dangerous rule-breakers will be brought to justice. 3. Deterrence: Imprisonment of a murderer serves as a deterrent to not only the individual receiving the punishment but also to other potential lawbreakers. The fear of harsh consequences can discourage people from engaging in criminal behavior, thereby contributing to a more peaceful and safe society. 4. Opportunities for rehabilitation: While not all societies achieve this goal effectively, the incarceration of a murderer also creates an opportunity to rehabilitate the person, helping them understand the gravity and consequences of their crime and possibly prepare them for reintegration into society if they are eventually released. This attempt at rehabilitation aligns with human common sense, as it signifies that a person's capacity for change and growth is valued, despite their heinous past actions. 5. Expression of societal values: Imprisoning a murderer represents a society's condemnation of such acts and its dedication to upholding values like respect for human life, safety, and wellbeing. It serves as a statement that such behavior is not tolerated and that the guilty will be held accountable for their actions. In conclusion, \\"going to prison\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in the context of punishing someone found guilty of committing murder because it adheres to the values, principles, and expectations that many societies have established regarding crime and punishment. The imprisonment of a murderer serves vital functions such as protection, deterrence, rehabilitation, and the expression of societal values, which are all important elements in maintaining a lawful and secure society."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Donald Trump's bad week Trump is facing the toughest test of his campaign after a week in which he veered into a series of unexpected controversies and -- for a change -- seemed to struggle in his response. His parade of missteps on issues ranging from national security to abortion have left the Republican front-runner wading through his roughest patch yet on the campaign trail. Trump will learn whether he dealt his campaign serious damage on Tuesday when GOP voters in Wisconsin go to the polls. Some surveys show Texas Sen. Ted Cruz leading in the primary there and a loss for Trump would make it that much harder to secure the 1,237 delegates he'll need to secure the nomination before the GOP convention. \\"I don't know that it's been the worst week of my campaign,\\" he told CBS News in comments that will air Sunday on \\"Face the Nation. \\"I think I've had many bad weeks and I've had many good weeks. I don't see this as the worst week in my campaign.\\" His opponents in the party believe he has already been damaged beyond repair among the broader electorate that will decide the general election. Tim Miller, senior advisor to the Our Principles PAC, which is dedicated to opposing Trump, believes that the idea that nothing hurts Trump is a \\"moronic piece of conventional wisdom.\\" \\"He has completely turned off huge swaths of the electorate. His numbers have continued to get worse. He would get absolutely massacred on a historic scale (in a general election). All of the data demonstrates it.\\" The week of staggering developments seems to encapsulate the wild, unorthodox nature of much of the Trump campaign, and the election cycle he has dominated. It began on Tuesday when his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged with simple battery in connection with an incident involving a female reporter. Trump's denial that his aide did anything wrong and his decision to attack Lewandowski's accuser during a CNN town hall raised new questions about his attitude towards women. During the same town hall, Trump abandoned his earlier pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee if it wasn't him. His Republican competitors, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, also backed off -- reflecting the deep divisions in the party heading into the election. And he shocked many foreign policy observers with comments suggesting he wants to curb nuclear proliferation while also raising the potential that Japan and South Korea develop such instruments to defend themselves. Trump set off an even more intense firestorm Wednesday -- and bipartisan anger -- when he suggested women who had an abortion should be punished if the procedure were outlawed. He then changed his line several times on an issue that is viewed as a deeply personal litmus test by many conservatives. On Friday, he again reversed course, telling CBS's \\"Face the Nation\\" that federal laws Trump also struggled through a highly critical radio interview with radio host Charlie Sykes -- without realizing the well-known Wisconsin conservative was a declared member of the #NeverTrump movement. Meanwhile, a flurry of news stories emerged about how Trump could harm Republicans in November, with a sudden focus on the fact that if he does not improve his standing, even the wide Republican House majority could be at risk. And Trump caused a new uproar after apparently not being familiar with delegate apportioning rules in Louisiana that could hand Cruz more delegates from the state, even though he walked away with a victory in the primary there. The sequence of events not only tests Trump's Teflon aura but also calls into question his unique method of campaigning, which relies on off-the-cuff calls from the gut, assaults on political correctness and an unusually small-scale political operation around the billionaire. Trump's defenders believe his message is so in tune with an angry electorate -- and his appeal is so broad -- that his liabilities could evaporate come November, especially against a Democratic candidate with her own high negatives, Hillary Clinton. \\"When you get down to a fall election, and the choice is between candidate A and candidate B, then the election always looks different,\\" Trump supporter and CNN contributor Jeffrey Lord said on \\"New Day.\\" \\"This kind of thing always happens.\\" Still, The Washington Post reported this week that Trump would be the most unpopular general election candidate since the paper started polling 32 years ago. Peter Feaver, a former senior National Security Council adviser in the George W. Bush administration, said that Trump's strength among core supporters has distracted attention away from his liabilities among a wider electorate. \\"Trump is the first time in history that we have a candidate who has held onto his supporters so long despite making so many mistakes,\\" said Feaver, now a professor of political science at Duke University. \\"He is also the first candidate in history to have been a front-runner for so long without generating any momentum among people who have not already supported him,\\" Feaver said, pointing to the imperative for all potential nominees of widening their political support base and unifying their party behind him. \\"That suggests to me that Trump has been hurting himself -- but in ways that are obscured by the unusual fact that they can still hold onto his base.\\" Trump's tough week came during a lull between primary contests, which meant the narrative of the campaign has, for the first time in a while, not been dominated by his apparent march to the nomination. In that space, the focus of the media has turned to policy and what Trump would do as president. At the same time, he's facing more intense cross-examination from journalists. In the CNN town hall, moderator Anderson Cooper dismissed his claim that Ted Cruz started a spat over their wives as the argument of a five-year-old. Sykes, meanwhile, told Trump in their interview that his row with Cruz was something he would expect from \\"a 12-year-old bully on the playground, not from somebody who wants the office held by Abraham Lincoln.\\" And Trump's botched answer on abortion came under intense questioning from MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews. The showdowns were a taste for Trump of the intense and increased scrutiny and pressure that the billionaire would face during a general election. And as the political season slips closer toward November, Trump's prospects are coming into focus, as polls show he curtrails both potential Democratic rivals, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Evidence of recent polls suggests that Trump could be digging himself into a hole that might be tough to escape during a general election campaign. In the latest CNN/ORC poll in mid-March, 73% of female voters said they had a negative view of Trump and just 26% view him positively -- figures that show a significant erosion from data earlier in the campaign. Those numbers also came before Trump's furious row with Cruz sparked when an unaffiliated super PAC tweeted out a picture of the billionaire's scantily clothed wife and former model Melania. Trump responded by retweeting an unflattering picture of Cruz's other half, Heidi. Crucially, Trump's standing among Republican women also seems to be eroding. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, nearly half of Republican women (47%) said they could not imagine themselves voting for Trump. That could be a danger sign for Trump in key swing state races in the fall in places like Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia, where Republican women in suburban locations could be especially crucial to his chances of being competitive. As Trump reflects on the events of the last week, it's possible he may conclude that his intimate, loyal campaign operation has left him exposed. For instance, had he been better briefed, or more steeped in the issues, he likely could have avoided the firestorm on abortion. And it's possible that Trump's contradictions on foreign policy — for instance, saying he is worried about nuclear proliferation but suggesting Japan and South Korea should get nuclear weapons — could have been avoided from organized tutorials with a more robust national security team than the cadre of little-known advisers he has named. So Trump's tough week could beget an evolution of his candidacy and his political campaign tactics and team. Failing that, he will need to maintain his unusual political immunity and break the rules that prevail in general elections just as he has rewritten the structure of the GOP nominating race. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Donald Trump faced a challenging week as he stumbled on an array of key issues, including national security and abortion, raising questions about his campaign strategy and possible implications for the general election.

For that, he picked up two eras in earth's history, era A and era B. Era A was hundred thousand years ago, and era B is in the present day. He now wants to compare these to eras to understand the change in climate better.  Would era A have more or less carbon dioxide in the air than era B? Answer:","output":"To answer John's question, we need to compare the carbon dioxide (CO2) levels during era A (100,000 years ago) and era B (present day). Let's investigate the CO2 levels step by step. Step 1: Collect data on carbon dioxide levels in era A and era B For era A, we can analyze the ice core samples obtained from places like Antarctica. The air bubbles trapped in the ice at the time of its formation can provide information about the CO2 levels during that time period. Similarly, for era B, we can refer to recent observations of atmospheric CO2 levels from scientific organizations such as NASA or NOAA. Step 2: Analyze and compare the data Once we have the CO2 levels for both eras, we can quantitatively compare them to understand whether era A had more or less CO2 in the air than era B. According to the available data: - Era A: 100,000 years ago, the CO2 levels were approximately 185-200 ppm (parts per million). - Era B: Present-day CO2 levels are over 410 ppm, according to recent measurements. Step 3: Draw a conclusion Based on the comparison of CO2 levels in both eras, we can conclude that era A had significantly less carbon dioxide in the air than era B. This result suggests that human activities have contributed to the increase in CO2 levels, which has led to the current issue of climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:I have a new situation: The ecologist moved from Aspen, where there was no air pollution, to Seattle which experienced a lot of air pollution. He started studying the weather there as well.  But I can use this background: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.  What is an answer for this question: Which city didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, the city that didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life is Aspen. Aspen is mentioned as having no air pollution, which is a key factor in the formation of acid rain. Acid rain, as explained, is caused by sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides released into the air from coal-fired power plants and motor vehicle exhaust, respectively. These air pollutants contribute to the low pH levels in precipitation, resulting in a harmful impact on wildlife, including the potential to kill insects and aquatic life. In contrast, Seattle has been described as a city that experiences a lot of air pollution, making it more likely for acid rain to occur there. Acid rain can lead to detrimental environmental effects, including damage to forests, freshwater habitats, and soils. The ecologist's move from Aspen to Seattle introduces the new challenge of studying the weather and potential environmental issues stemming from increased air pollution. In summary, Aspen is the city that did not experience rain that can kill aquatic life due to its lack of air pollution. Seattle, on the other hand, has air pollution that contributes to the formation of acid rain, which can threaten the health and survival of aquatic life and other wildlife."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One time I was walking my puppy (profile pic) who was then around 5 months, with my mum and grandma. By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn’t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS’s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought “Dear Lord someone’s losing a limb today.” When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car. A woman in a pickup truck comes next trying to get the husky but he ran away again, but my mom didn’t care, she scooped up our pup and ran, the leash trailing behind her, and even my grandma who has troubles in her knees speed walked. My mom would later laugh at me because I became so pale and because I tried to baby talk a dog to leave us alone.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation -1111*a = 598*a + 22217 for a, let's follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms with 'a' on one side of the equation. To do this, add 1111*a to both sides of the equation: -1111*a + 1111*a = 598*a + 1111*a + 22217 This simplifies to: 0 = 1709*a + 22217 Step 2: Isolate 'a' by moving the constant to the other side of the equation. Subtract 22217 from both sides of the equation: 1709*a = -22217 Step 3: Divide by the coefficient of 'a' to find the value of 'a'. Divide both sides of the equation by 1709: a = -22217 / 1709 Now, calculating the division: a ≈ -13 So, the solution for the equation -1111*a = 598*a + 22217 is a ≈ -13."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: when the accidental destruction of the Moon by space? 2030 A:","output":"Title: Lunar Cataclysm Genre: Sci-fi, Action, Drama Setting: Earth and Space, Year 2030 Plot Overview: The year is 2030, and mankind has made significant advancements in space exploration and colonization. The first self-sustaining lunar colony, Artemis, thrives on the Moon's surface with a growing population of 5,000 residents. Accompanying the burgeoning colony is a revolutionary moon-based power plant designed to harness solar energy and deliver it directly to Earth via wireless transmission. This groundbreaking technology substantially alleviates Earth's energy crisis, bringing newfound hope to a world grappling with overpopulation and dwindling resources. On Earth, the Unified International Space Agency (UISA) eagerly prepares for a historic manned mission to Mars. The mission, led by decorated astronaut Commander Allison Ford, has captured the world's imagination. Prior to the launch, UISA announces a final, routine test - the ignition of a powerful experimental antimatter propulsion system near the Moon's trajectory. The new propulsion system promises to shorten travel time to Mars and other distant locations by months or even years. Unbeknownst to UISA, a rogue asteroid enters the solar system and alters the Moon's orbit. As the UISA scientists initiate the final tests for the antimatter propulsion system near the Moon, the unexpected shift in the lunar trajectory results in a catastrophic explosion. Massive chunks of the Moon are blasted into space, while vast amounts of debris crash down on Earth, triggering widespread tsunamis, earthquakes, and meteor showers.  As Earth descends into chaos, Commander Ford and her crew face the somber realization that their families and friends are in grave peril. UISA dispatches an unmanned craft to Artemis with relief supplies and cutting-edge technology, including a small team of highly advanced AI-controlled drones designed to fend off the looming asteroid threat. Meanwhile, stranded Martian colonists scramble to devise a rescue plan with their Earthly counterparts. In a race against time, Commander Ford and her team must strategize how to deal with the impending asteroid menace, restore Artemis's space-faring capabilities, and return to Earth to help save their loved ones. Onboarding a brilliant and relentless scientist, Dr. Vincent Shaw, the UISA Mars mission crew devises a risky plan to rebuild and repair a lunar transport in the wreckage of Artemis. Working closely with UISA's AI drones, Dr. Shaw engineers a powerful weapon capable of vaporizing the encroaching asteroids. As the lunar colonists join forces with the stranded Mars mission crew, Commander Ford faces agonizing decisions about who will return to Earth on their makeshift craft and who is left behind. Ultimately, personal sacrifices must be made for the greater good. In the riveting climax, the UISA Mars mission crew successfully implements Dr. Shaw's weapon, neutralizing the asteroid threat as their make-shift lunar transport takes off to traverse the Earth's ravaged atmosphere. The crew's re-entry and dramatic rescue mission on Earth become the foundation for global unity, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to develop new technologies aimed at preventing future celestial catastrophes. 'Lunar Cataclysm' explores themes of heroism in the face of disaster, humanity's aptitude for innovation, and the complexities of personal sacrifice. This thrilling, suspenseful, and emotional journey asks how far we'll go to forge a brighter future amidst the specter of global catastrophe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Selecting more lemons Given that the initial lemon was not ripe enough to produce sufficient juice, I decided to select a few more lemons. I chose three additional ripe lemons that appeared larger and juicier to make sure I would get enough juice to fill the cup. Step 2: Rolling and soften the lemons Before cutting them, I rolled the lemons on a flat surface applying gentle pressure with my hand. This process helps break down some of the internal fibers and results in the release of more juice from the fruit. Step 3: Cutting and juice extraction After rolling the lemons, I cut them in half crosswise. Using a citrus juicer, I squeezed each lemon half to extract the juice. The juicer made it easier to extract the maximum amount of juice possible and minimized the risk of seeds falling into the cup. Step 4: Measuring the juice As I extracted the juice from each lemon half, I kept an eye on the cup's fill level. Once the juice reached the desired amount, I stopped extracting to avoid any excess. Step 5: Straining the juice (Optional) In case there were any small seeds, pulp, or unwanted residue in the lemon juice, I strained it using a fine mesh strainer to ensure the juice was smooth and seed-free. By following these steps, I was able to fill the cup with the desired amount of lemon juice, compensating for the initial lemon's inadequate juice yield.

Background of the Situation Transavia, which primarily operates short and medium-haul flights, has been a low-cost branch of Air France-KLM since 2007. As part of the group's long-term strategy to improve revenues and expand market share in the competitive airline industry, Air France has announced plans to develop Transavia's operations further. The proposed plan includes adding new routes and increasing the number of aircraft operated by the subsidiary.  However, the pilots' union sees this expansion as a threat to their pay and job security. With the aim to maintain competitiveness, the airline's growth strategy for its low-cost unit comes hand in hand with numerous cost-saving measures. Pilots are concerned that this will lead to a weakening of employment terms and conditions, particularly those pertaining to remuneration and working hours. Strike Action and Flight Disruptions In response to the proposed expansion, pilots have chosen to strike on September 15th. The labor dispute has led to hundreds of flights being cancelled, inevitably causing disruptions for passengers and affecting Air France's bottom line. With negotiations at a standstill, the airline has been forced to find alternative options for its affected passengers, including rebooking their flights or offering refunds. The strike has also had a negative impact on cargo transportation, exacerbating an already strained supply chain caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Passenger and Industry Reactions The strike has, understandably, led to a wave of complaint and frustration from affected passengers who now face significant delays and complications in their travel plans. The airline industry, too, has been critical of the situation. For an industry still reeling from the effects of the pandemic, such events could cause potential passengers to choose alternative modes of transportation or opt for other airlines that are perceived to have fewer disruptions. Possible Outcomes and Solutions To resolve this situation, Air France and the pilots' union need to find a compromise that satisfies both parties. It is crucial for the airline to continue its growth and maintain competitiveness in the market while addressing pilots' concerns and ensuring their job security. Potential solutions may include reassessing the employment conditions for pilots working for Transavia, providing clearer career progression paths, or introducing policies which ensure that current Air France pilots are not negatively affected by the expansion. Conclusion The ongoing strike by Air France pilots over proposed Transavia expansion has led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and significant disruptions for passengers. While the airline seeks to grow and maintain its profitability by expanding its low-cost subsidiary, it is essential that it addresses the concerns of the pilots' union to ensure fair treatment and to avoid further labor disputes and disruptions. A successful resolution would result in a mutually beneficial outcome for the airline, its pilots, and passengers who depend on its services."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stragely, all but the Mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: the Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, the widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath, suicide bombings in Israel, paranoia-hit and state-persecuted Muslim Americans in the USA, old people living alone, and the aftermath of WWII in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This might say something sad about the limits of empathy, in both ways: the directors might feel that Americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies, while they effectively do the same with their short films.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who, in 1663, made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland? is inside the article: The Netherlands provided William Bruce with many of his influences. He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House. Konrad Ottenheym concludes that Bruce employed an \\"international style\\", which was fashionable in France, Holland, and England, and that he was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland., can you guess it ?

Question: Given the following passage  \\"Life with My Sister Madonna, a book by Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted at number two on The New York Times bestseller list. The book caused some friction between Madonna and her brother, because of the unsolicited publication. Problems also arose between Madonna and Ritchie, with the media reporting that they were on the verge of separation. Ultimately, Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences, which was finalized in December 2008. She decided to adopt from Malawi.

The premise states that \\"Two dogs are chewing at a red object whilst running in the snow.\\" This information explicitly mentions that the dogs are engaged in running while they are chewing at a red object. To dissect the premise, we can take note of the following information provided: 1. There are two dogs involved in the scenario. 2. The dogs are chewing at a red object. 3.

Translate this to English?","output":"The given Finnish phrase \\"Näin määrätään työjärjestyksessä\\" can be translated to English as \\"This is determined by the work order\\" or \\"This is specified in the work order.\\" The translation suggests that a particular task, operation, or procedure is determined or described within a specific work order. Work orders are documents issued to indicate tasks, jobs, or projects that need to be carried out, often as part of a larger plan or operation. They typically contain essential details, such as the description of the work to be done, the necessary materials or equipment, the workers responsible for the task, the deadline, and any relevant safety or quality instructions. Work orders are commonly used in a variety of industries, including construction, manufacturing, maintenance, and services. The phrase emphasizes the importance of adherence to the specified work order. Abiding by the work order's conditions ensures that the work proceeds according to the planned timeline and can minimize confusion or misunderstandings. Additionally, following the work order can also help in maintaining quality standards and compliance with any industry-specific or legal requirements. In some cases, the phrase may imply that a particular decision, such as the sequence of operations or the allocation of resources, has been made based on the work order's instructions. This could be a response to a question about why a particular procedure or method has been chosen or why certain tasks have been prioritized over others. It is important to remember that the translation of the phrase may depend on the context in which it is being used.

Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an excepted charity, and fully registered with the Charities Commission, and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the UK. As a charity, it benefits from substantial tax breaks. It was calculated by the late David Jewell, former Master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the School about £1,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the School. This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as \\"assisted places\\") to independent schools. However, no child attended Eton on this scheme, meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the School has always been lower. Eton's retiring Head Master, Tony Little, has claimed that the benefits that Eton provides to the local community free of charge (use of its facilities, etc.) have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status. The fee for the academic year 2010–2011 was £29,862 (approximately US48,600 or €35,100 as of March 2011), although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships.

If one doesn't obey the order and moves, he or she will be shot to death. One evening in Los Angeles, someone rang the bell of a house. It was a dangerous area at night, so the _ of the house took his gun with him when he answered the door. He opened the door and saw a strange man. But the man turned round and started walking away from the house. The owner cried: \\"Freeze\\", but the young man went on walking without obeying the owner's order. The owner thought he was trying to run away, so he shot at the young man and he was killed. Later, police found that the dead man was a Japanese student who was studying in Los Angeles University. He went to visit a friend, but unluckily could not remember the number of the house. When he realized he went to the wrong house he turned round and left.

This type of injury can cause damage to the ball and socket (glenohumeral) joint where the humerus bone attaches to the shoulder girdle. A fracture in this location causes difficulty with shoulder movement, such as trying to raise the arm overhead. OPT: a). Your doctor will do measurements based on the severity of the injury, or joint or socket that was injured. Make a splint for your humerus fracture.. b). Palpate (touch) the upper arm and feel for any bumps, lumps or evidence of broken skin. Carefully remove or alter clothing so you can see the entire arm and look for signs of bruising, inflammation or deformity.. c). It is important to identify a proximal humerus fracture so that you can get medical attention. For the best chance, a fracture is not identified at the time of injury.. d). It will require medical treatment to ensure proper pain and recovery. It is often easier to splint a fractured shoulder with surgery.. Answer:","output":"b). Palpate (touch) the upper arm and feel for any bumps, lumps or evidence of broken skin. Carefully remove or alter clothing so you can see the entire arm and look for signs of bruising, inflammation or deformity. After identifying a proximal humerus fracture, it is crucial to provide proper first aid to aid in pain management and prevent further complications until professional medical help can be sought. Follow these steps to splint a humerus fracture: 1. First and foremost, call for emergency medical help or have someone else do it. While waiting for the professionals to arrive, you can proceed with splinting the fractured arm. 2. Keep the injured person as still as possible, and provide reassurance that help is on the way. Try to minimize movements, especially in the affected area, to prevent further injury. 3. Assess the arm for any noticeable deformities, skin breaks, or other visible signs of the fracture. Be cautious when handling the arm to avoid exacerbating the injury or causing unnecessary pain. 4. If any open wounds are present, cover them with a sterile dressing to protect from contamination and infection. Be mindful of applying excessive pressure to these areas. 5. Find a rigid and sturdy material to use as a splint; this can be anything from a piece of wood, a rolled-up magazine, or even a firm pillow. The splint should be long enough to stabilize the joint above and below the fracture site. 6. Gently, but firmly, immobilize the affected arm by placing the splint along the length of the humerus, which is the long bone in the upper arm. Be sure to support the entire arm, from the shoulder to the elbow. 7. Hold the splint in place using bandages, strips of cloth, or even torn pieces of clothing. Wrap the material around the arm and splint, ensuring that it is secure but not too tight, as this may cause more harm than good. 8. Once the arm is immobilized, support the affected arm with a sling. You can use a triangular bandage or even a long and wide strip of cloth. The sling should go under the arm and around the neck, providing support and minimizing movement. 9. Monitor the person for signs of shock, such as a rapid pulse, shallow breathing, cold or sweaty skin, and paleness. If these symptoms become apparent, lay the person down, elevate their legs, and cover them with a blanket to help regulate their body temperature. 10. Continue to provide reassurance and support until professional help arrives, at which point, they will take over the treatment and management of the humerus fracture. Remember to provide any pertinent information regarding the injury, such as how it occurred and any interventions performed, to the healthcare provider. By following these steps, you can safely and effectively splint a humerus fracture and ensure the injured person receives proper care while waiting for emergency medical help. Keep in mind that this is only a temporary measure and should not replace professional evaluation and treatment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: What does the Napoleonic Concardat of 1801 give? Context: Most of the Alsatian population is Roman Catholic, but, largely because of the region's German heritage, a significant Protestant community also exists: today, the EPCAAL (a Lutheran church) is France's second largest Protestant church, also forming an administrative union (UEPAL) with the much smaller Calvinist EPRAL. Unlike the rest of France, the Local law in Alsace-Moselle still provides for to the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 and the organic articles, which provides public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues; religion classes in one of these faiths is compulsory in public schools. This divergence in policy from the French majority is due to the region having been part of Imperial Germany when the 1905 law separating the French church and state was instituted (for a more comprehensive history, see: Alsace-Lorraine). Controversy erupts periodically on the appropriateness of this legal disposition, as well as on the exclusion of other religions from this arrangement. The answer to this question is:","output":"The Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 gives public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues, and makes religion classes in one of these faiths compulsory in public schools in Alsace-Moselle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.  Question: \\"What was the worst oil spill in U.S. history?\\" Answer: \\"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"What was the worst oil spill in U.S. history?\\" is correct. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, also known as the BP oil spill, is considered the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The disaster occurred on April 20, 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, owned by Transocean Ltd. and leased by BP, exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and injuring 17 others. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf, causing extensive environmental, economic, and social damages.  In the aftermath of the spill, investigations were carried out by multiple parties, including the U.S. government, independent organizations, and the companies involved. In January 2011, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that assigned blame for the accident among Transocean, BP, and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing. The report concluded that the disaster was likely due to a combination of factors, including poor risk management, systemic organizational failures, and inadequate regulatory oversight. The Deepwater Horizon disaster had far-reaching consequences, with damaged ecosystems, massive costs related to clean-up efforts, and economic losses, especially for the fishing and tourism industries in the Gulf region. Furthermore, the spill led to a reevaluation of offshore drilling practices and regulations in the U.S., with new safety and environmental protection measures being imposed on the industry. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"What was the worst oil spill in U.S. history?\\" is, indeed, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This tragic event continues to serve as a painful reminder of the potential risks and devastating consequences associated with offshore oil and gas operations, and highlights the importance of rigorous safety and environmental oversight in the industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece from Meyerbeer?  Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

Possible answers:  (1). yes.  (2). it is not possible to tell.  (3). no.","output":"(3). No. While it is true that having someone home all the time can make it more effective to complete tasks and chores within the household, it does not necessarily imply that \\"everything can be done.\\" There could be various factors and reasons that might prevent all tasks from being accomplished, even with someone constantly present at home. Firstly, the person's ability and expertise play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the tasks at hand. Each individual possesses a different set of skills, and some tasks might require specialized knowledge or skills for appropriate completion. Even if someone is home all the time, they may lack the competence to manage certain tasks. For example, repairing a complex electrical appliance or dealing with plumbing issues may require the assistance of a professional technician, regardless of the individual being at home all day. Secondly, the capacity to manage tasks might be a constraint. Sometimes, there may be multiple tasks that need immediate attention, making it impossible for a single individual to manage all of them simultaneously. Additionally, if someone is looking after the children or attending to family members with special needs, their primary focus will be on providing care and support, leaving them with limited time and energy to devote to other tasks. Thirdly, external factors can also impede the ability to complete tasks at home. For instance, financial constraints could lead to delays in making necessary home improvements or addressing essential repairs. Moreover, such limitations might also impact the procurement of necessary resources, such as groceries and supplies, hindering a person's ability to accomplish everything. Lastly, fatigue and mental health can influence productivity and efficacy. Constantly staying at home and managing an array of tasks may cause stress and burnout, leading to a decline in a person's ability to attend to and complete all the tasks on their plate. In conclusion, while having someone at home all the time can contribute to accomplishing more within the household, it does not guarantee that everything can be done. Factors such as abilities, capacity, external influences, and mental well-being can all impact the completion of tasks, regardless of the individual's constant presence in the house."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bill looked up the Gaia hypothesis, while Frank read about the Flat Earth theory.  Which friend read less about the composition of our atmosphere? A:","output":"Without specific information about the exact content that Bill and Frank read, it is impossible to determine with certainty who read less about the composition of our atmosphere. However, we can analyze the topics that each friend chose to read about and make an educated guess. The Gaia hypothesis, proposed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, argues that Earth is a self-regulating, complex system that maintains the conditions necessary for life. From a broad perspective, this hypothesis suggests that the living and non-living components of Earth, such as the atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere, interact and work together to maintain a harmonious balance that sustains life on the planet. Studying the Gaia hypothesis would likely involve examining the composition of our atmosphere due to its crucial role in regulating Earth's climate system and supporting life. On the other hand, Flat Earth theory is a belief that Earth is flat rather than spherical in shape. Individuals who hold to this theory question or deny the widely accepted evidence that supports Earth's sphericity, such as satellite images and astronauts' observations from space. While Flat Earth theorists may discuss certain aspects of Earth's atmosphere, such as why it appears curved in photos taken from high altitude, their focus is primarily on the overall shape of the Earth and not on the composition of the atmosphere. Based on the general content of each topic, we can infer that Bill, who looked up the Gaia hypothesis, likely read more about the composition of our atmosphere, as it has a more direct relevance to the topic. Frank, who read about the Flat Earth theory, would likely have encountered less information about the atmospheric composition since the theory mostly focuses on the Earth's shape. Therefore, we can conclude that it is most probable that Frank read less about the composition of our atmosphere during their sleepover. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based upon the typical scope and content of each topic and could be different if they delved into varying aspects of their chosen topics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If an animal does not fatten up before entering hibernation, it will have a negative impact on the animal's ability to hibernate properly. Fattening up allows the animal to store energy reserves in their body in the form of fat. These energy reserves are critical to the animal's survival during hibernation, as they are not consuming any food during this dormant period. Without sufficient fat reserves, the animal will have less energy available to sustain itself throughout the entire hibernation period, resulting in a higher risk of starvation and other health issues. Consequently, it may be unable to maintain essential bodily functions like temperature regulation, a stable heart rate, and proper cell maintenance at a reduced rate. This scenario corresponds to a \\"more effect\\" situation as it poses a greater threat to the animal's well-being and survival. As for the second effect mentioned—the animal finding or building a suitable place to hibernate—it may also be negatively influenced by the animal's lack of fat reserves. An animal that has not fattened up properly may have less energy to allocate to searching for or constructing an appropriate den. Consequently, they may choose a less-than-ideal location, leaving them more vulnerable to predators, extreme temperatures, and other environmental threats. Overall, this further increases the risk of harm to the animal during hibernation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

It was probably our first form of self-expression when we were babies: long before we start writing, we're painting and scribbling , both in order to make sense of the world and because we enjoy it.    In the history of human culture, too, painting and image making came before writing or even simple mathematics: 30,000 years ago compared to 5,000. Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \\" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\\"    When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating  the hand and the eye with the pencil. It's a basic skill, no more difficult to learn than other amazing things that humans do, such as hitting a tennis ball over the net or writing our own name. there's no special talent involved. Anybody who can learn to write can learn to draw.    So, there you are - no excuse not to get out your pencil, pencil sharpener and rubber and take part in the Big Draw, a nationwide series of free art events taking place all over Britain next October. Everyone's welcome: all you need is a willingness to express yourself through drawing.    The Big Draw, now in its fifth year, has already achieved two world records: one for the longest drawing in the world (1km) and the other for the greatest number of people drawing at the same time (7,000). This year, there will be an attempt to create a new Guinness World Record for the longest visitors'book: people will be invited to leave their name and a drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper.    The theme this year is InsideOutside--People, Structure( ) and Spaces, and other events planned include drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper.    The Big Draw is not about turning the nation into artists, it is about helping people to acquire this universal language of communication.

Ernest Edward \\"Ernie\\" Kovacs (January 23, 1919 - January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer. Kovacs's visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Many individuals and shows, such as Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jim Henson, Max Headroom, Chevy Chase, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Dave Garroway, Uncle Floyd, and many others have credited Kovacs as an influence. Chevy Chase thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy award for Saturday Night Live. Kovacs's father Andrew emigrated from Hungary at age 13. He worked as a policeman, restaurateur, and bootlegger; the last so successfully that he moved his wife Mary, and sons Tom and Ernie, into a 20-room mansion in the better part of Trenton.  Though a poor student, Kovacs was influenced by his Trenton Central High School drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and received an acting scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1937 with Van Kirk's help. The end of Prohibition and the Depression resulted in difficult financial times for the family. When Kovacs began drama school, all he could afford was a fifth floor walk-up apartment on West 74th Street in New York City. During this time, he watched many \\"Grade B\\" movies; admission was only ten cents. Many of these movies influenced his comedy routines later.  A 1938 local newspaper photograph shows Kovacs as a member of the Prospect Players, not yet wearing his trademark mustache. Like any aspiring actor, Kovacs used his class vacation time to pursue roles in summer stock companies. While working in Vermont during 1939, he became so seriously ill with pneumonia and pleurisy that his doctors didn't expect him to survive. During the next year and a half, his comedic talents developed as he entertained both doctors and patients with his antics during stays at several hospitals. While hospitalized, Kovacs developed a lifelong love of classical music by the gift of a radio, which he kept tuned to WQXR. By the time he was released, his parents had separated, and Kovacs went back to Trenton, living with his mother in a two-room apartment over a store. He began work as a cigar salesman, which resulted in a lifelong cigar-smoking habit.  Kovacs's first paid entertainment work was during 1941, as an announcer for Trenton's radio station WTTM. He spent the next nine years with WTTM, becoming the station's director of Special Events; in this job he did things like trying to see what it was like to be run over by a train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved with local theater; a local newspaper published a photograph of him and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941. The Trentonian, a local weekly newspaper, offered Kovacs a column in June 1945; he named it \\"Kovacs Unlimited\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"There are definitely interesting aspects in this article, such as: 1. Ernie Kovacs's struggle for survival during a serious illness with pneumonia and pleurisy, and how it contributed to the development of his comedic talents as he entertained doctors and patients during his hospitalization. 2.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who told someone \\"I've never said I'm born again\\"?  Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah. Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League. Time magazine quoted him saying about Kahane, \\"He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together.\\" Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane. During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship. Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: \\"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.\\" From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \\"born again\\" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: \\"I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come.\\" In response to Loder's asking whether he belonged to any church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, \\"Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind.\\"When it was asked of Dylan in a 1986 press conference in Australia \\"How much do you feel you are a vessel, a medium for a higher power, for God, that it [the music] flows through you... for Him?\\" Dylan replied, \\"Well I feel that way about most of the stuff that I do.\\"In 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek: Here's the thing with me and the religious thing.

Uncertainty about the drug's possible anti-cancer qualities has led to fierce medical debate in recent years. If it is proven to work, scientists say it would be \\"game-changing\\", by providing a cheap and effective way to help more patients survive. During the study, funded by the charity Cancer Research UK and the NIHR - the research arm of the NHS - patients will take a tablet every day for five years. Researchers will compare groups of patients taking different doses of aspirin with people taking dummy (placebo) pills and check for any recurrences of cancer. Dr Fiona Reddington from Cancer Research UK said: \\"The trial is especially exciting as cancers that recur are often harder to treat so finding a cheap and effective way to prevent this is potentially game-changing for patients.\\" The trial will run across 100 UK centres, involving patients who are having or have had treatment for early cancer, and will last up to 12 years. But scientists warn that aspirin is not suitable for everyone and should not be used without medical advice. Taking the drug every day comes with a serious health warning as it can cause side effects such as ulcers and bleeding from the stomach, or even the brain.

The tablet has aspirin in it, and scientists want to see if the aspirin helps to stop the cancer from coming back. If it works, it could be a cheap and simple way to help cancer patients.

One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats.

Answer a question about this article: Although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a \\"tinge of jealousy and spite\\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \\"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \\"my friend Liszt\\". Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand.

Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’.

Somalia has the longest coastline on Africa's mainland, and its terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains and highlands. Climatically, hot conditions prevail year-round, with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall.  - Aden (, ; \\"\\" ) is a port city in Yemen, located by the eastern approach to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aden), some east of Bab-el-Mandeb. Its population is approximately 800,000 people. Aden's ancient, natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano which now forms a peninsula, joined to the mainland by a low isthmus. This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC. The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula.

A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe.

After several high-profile men have resigned due to claims of sexual misconduct, some Democratic lawmakers are suggesting that President Trump should follow suit.      In the wake of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, “Today” show host Matt Lauer and Democratic Sen. Al Franken losing their jobs over misconduct allegations, a couple of high-profile Democratic senators suggested that the president should do the same.      “President Trump has committed assault, according to these women, and those are very credible allegations of misconduct and criminal activity, and he should be fully investigated and he should resign,” Gillibrand told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.      The remarks came as three of Trump’s accusers spoke out again about his behavior.      “In an objective setting, without question, a person with this record would have entered the graveyard of political aspirations never to return. Yet, here we are with that man as President,” Rachel Crooks, one of Trump’s accusers, explained at a press conference Wednesday.      Here’s what the lawmakers have said.      Kirsten Gillibrand      Gillibrand told CNN’s Chrisiane Amanpour Monday that Trump should resign, and have congress investigate the allegations of he does not. “These allegations are credible; they are numerous. I’ve heard these women’s testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking,” she told Amanpour.      Ron Wyden      Wyden, a Democratic Senator from Oregon, echoed Gillibrand’s sentiments on Twitter. “These women are right. If [President Trump] won’t resign, Congress must investigate allegations by many, many women that he sexually assaulted and harassed them. No one is above the law,” he tweeted.      Cory Booker      Booker told Vice News Saturday that if Franken can be coerced into resignation, it’s only fair that Trump follow suit because the allegations are more damning. “I just watched Sen. Al Franken do the honorable thing and resign from his office. My question is, why isn’t Donald Trump doing the same thing — who has more serious allegations against him, with more women who have come forward. The fact pattern on him is far more damning than the fact pattern on Al Franken,” the New Jersey Senator told Vice.      Jeff Merkley      Speaking on MSNBC on Dec. 7 — the day Al Franken resigned — Merkley mentioned the possibility of Trump’s resignation when disavowing Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused by multiple women is sexual misconduct when they were teenagers and he was in his thirties. “He should drop out of that race right now.” Merkley said of Moore. “And by the way, for that, matter, the President should resign because he certainly has a track record with more than 17 women of horrific conduct.” ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

(Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump sailed past a raft of allegations of sexual misconduct in last year's presidential election.      Now the national #MeToo spotlight is turning back to Trump and his past conduct. Several of his accusers are urging Congress to investigate his behavior, and a number of Democratic lawmakers are demanding his resignation.      With each day seeming to bring new headlines that force men from positions of power, the movement to expose sexual harassment has forced an unwelcome conversation on the White House. In a heated exchange with reporters in the White House briefing room on Monday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders steadfastly dismissed accusations against the Republican president and suggested the issue had already been litigated in Trump's favor on Election Day.      But to Trump's accusers, the rising #MeToo movement is an occasion to ensure he is at last held accountable.      \\"It was heartbreaking last year. We're private citizens and for us to put ourselves out there to try and show America who this man is and how he views women, and for them to say, 'Eh, we don't care,' it hurt,\\" Samantha Holvey said Monday. The former beauty queen claimed that Trump ogled her and other Miss USA pageant contestants in their dressing room in 2006.      \\"Let's try round two,\\" she said. \\"The environment's different. Let's try again.\\"      Holvey was one of four women to make her case against Trump on Monday, both in an NBC interview and then in a news conference. Rachel Crooks, a former Trump Tower receptionist who said the celebrity businessman kissed her on the mouth in 2006 without consent, called for Congress to \\"put aside party affiliations and investigate Trump's history of sexual misconduct.\\"      \\"If they were willing to investigate Sen. Franken, it's only fair that they do the same for Trump,\\" Crooks said.      Franken, the Democratic senator from Minnesota, announced last week that he would resign amid an ethics probe into accusations that he sexually harassed several women. Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich., and Trent Franks, R-Ariz., also resigned after misconduct accusations.      But a Capitol Hill investigation into Trump's conduct appears unlikely. The Senate and House Ethics Committees investigate members of Congress, not presidents, and Republican-led committees are not apt to investigate Trump on sexual misconduct unless there is some sort of connection to the ongoing Russia probe.      Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Congress shouldn't investigate the allegations against Trump.      \\"I don't think there's any forum for us to do that,\\" he said. \\"Just think about how that could be abused.\\"      Nonetheless, several Democratic senators have seized the moment and called for Trump to step down.      \\"President Trump should resign,\\" New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told CNN on Monday. \\"These allegations are credible; they are numerous. I've heard these women's testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking.\\"      New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley have also called on Trump to resign.      White House aides have warily watched the movement sweep Capitol Hill, opting to repeat rote denials about allegations against the president. The president's advisers were stunned Sunday when one of the highest-ranking women in the Trump administration broke with the White House line and said the accusers' voices \\"should be heard.\\"      \\"They should be heard, and they should be dealt with,\\" Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said in a CBS interview. \\"And I think we heard from them before the election. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.\\"      Haley's comments infuriated the president, according to two people who are familiar with his views but who spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. Trump has grown increasingly angry in recent days that the accusations against him have resurfaced, telling associates that the charges are false and drawing parallels to the accusations facing Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.      Sixteen women have come forward with a range of accusations against Trump, many after the release of the \\"Access Hollywood\\" tape last October in which Trump was caught on an open microphone bragging about groping women. One woman, Summer Zevos, a contestant on Trump's reality show, \\"The Apprentice,\\" sued, contending that Trump's denials of her accusations amount to false and defamatory statements.      Jessica Leeds, who appeared at Monday's news conference, recalled sitting on an airplane next to Trump in the 1970s when he began to fondle her.      \\"All of a sudden, he's all over me. Kissing and groping, groping and kissing,\\" she said. \\"Nothing was said. It was just this silent groping going on.\\"      Trump denied the allegations during the campaign, and Sanders did the same Monday.      \\"Look, as the president said himself, he thinks it's a good thing that women are coming forward, but he also feels strongly that a mere allegation shouldn't determine the course,\\" Sanders said. \\"And again, the American people knew this and voted for the president. And we feel like we're ready to move forward in that process.\\"      Sanders declined to say whether she believed the accusers or if she herself had been the victim of harassment. She grew impatient with the repeated questions and pledged to provide a list of eyewitnesses whose accounts exonerated the president.      The White House did not provide the list by late Monday.      ___      Associated Press writers Zeke Miller and Richard Lardner contributed to this report from Washington.      ___      Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire      ___      This story has been corrected to show that Holvey was a contestant in the Miss USA pageant, not the Miss America pageant. ||||| Donald J.

This comes after various high-profile men, such as Harvey Weinstein and Al Franken, have lost their positions over similar allegations. Trump's accusers have spoken out again in light of the #MeToo movement, with some calling for a congressional investigation into his behavior if he does not resign.

Given the question: Given the below context:  The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi....

Title: Not the best sundial book available Review: I found Rohr not to be as useful as the two other texts by Waugh or Mayall and Mayall.

A little underwhelmed, a little over stimulated, but I wouldn't fight my friends or refuse to show up if they planned a happy hour here. The identity crisis between sports bar and sushi bar was a little distracting to me - we sat outside where TVs were playing some sporting event, but inside seemed more like Feng Shui-ed. The restrooms were highly entertaining with remote controlled toilets and sensor activated zen inspiring pebble sinks; if I wasn't so hungry I probably would have spent more time in there playing with the gadgets.   We unfortunately had just missed happy hour, but I could see how the slashed prices may be somewhat redeeming. The menu had some pretty decent veg options. However, the tofu lettuce wraps had a sour funk that smelled like feet. They didn't taste much better either so I'd steer clear of those if I were ever to stumble on the occasion where I had no choice but to dine here. I'll admit the veggie roll was actually tasty, not enough to make me a loyal patron though.  I've had better food. I've had better atmosphere. I've spent less money on mediocre sushi.

Q: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care.

No The statement \\"Inscriptions have been found beneath many of the rock paintings, but archaeologists have so far been unable to decipher this form of ancient writing\\" does not directly answer the question \\"Along with the Hargesian culture, what culture was present in Somalia in the Stone age?\\". The provided statement focuses on the fact that inscriptions have been found beneath rock paintings but doesn't give any specific information about other cultures existing alongside the Hargesian culture in Somalia during the Stone Age. Somalia, located in the Horn of Africa, has a rich history that dates back to the Stone Age. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that, along with the Hargesian culture, the Laas Geel culture was also present in this region during the Stone Age. The Laas Geel culture is known for its intricate rock paintings found in the Laas Geel caves. These paintings depict local peoples interacting with surrounding wildlife, such as cattle, giraffes, and antelopes. Additionally, the Laas Geel caves exhibit some of the earliest known art in Africa. Furthermore, evidence of pottery, stone tools, and occasional lithic remains has also been found, helping us to understand the lives of these prehistoric peoples. In contrast, the Hargesian culture, which was also present during the same period, is named after the Hargeisa region. This culture is characterized mainly by stone tools such as stone picks, pottery, and microlithic implements. These tools suggest that the Hargesian people followed a subsistence strategy focused on hunting, gathering, and fishing practices. In conclusion, although the initially provided statement gives some interesting information about ancient inscriptions, it does not directly answer the posed question. The correct answer should state that the Laas Geel culture existed alongside the Hargesian culture in Somalia during the Stone Age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A child learns to walk by practicing until he no longer has to think about how to put one foot in front of the other. An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity  \\".  www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase  . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount   of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home. You can test yourself by reading something new which is suitable   for your level. If you read aloud with expression, with a sense of the meaning of the sentences, you probably are an automatic reader.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: A nice detail from the JPost’s write-up of today’s grand sellout. Turns out “snap inspections” are actually “nearly-a-month’s-notice inspections.”      Negotiators failed to meet the standard of achieving “anytime, anywhere” access that several members of the United States Congress had demanded as a part of any nuclear deal. Instead, in the event Iran objects to an IAEA request for access to a specific site, a “clock” will begin that grants the two sides 14 days to negotiate. If that period expires without any resolution reached directly between Iran and the IAEA, the Joint Commission would have seven days to advise them on a way forward. Iran would then have three days to comply with the commission’s final advice, bringing the total time on the clock to 24 days… “We don’t think that ‘anytime, anywhere’ inspections are feasible,” the official said. “It’s just not something that happens anywhere in the world.”      All you need to do to make sense of this deal is believe, as the White House obviously does, that attacking Iran’s enrichment facilities would be a worse outcome than Iran building a bomb. That’s it. The great shining “achievement” of the deal isn’t that it eliminates Iran’s program — it doesn’t — but that it removes any remaining domestic pressure on Obama to further escalate with Iran, either by sanctions or military strike, to stop it. The eternal argument against attacking Iran’s program is that virtually no one believes the attack would completely destroy all of the country’s nuclear infrastructure, just damage enough of it to set Tehran back 10 years or so. But … that’s exactly what today’s deal does. It’s not a permanent fix. By its own terms and Obama’s admission, after 12 years of compliance, Iran will be able to introduce advanced centrifuges and reduce its “breakout” time to nearly nothing, making it a full “nuclear threshold” state.      In an interview with NPR in April, Mr. Obama said that in “year 13, 14, 15” of the agreement, the breakout time might shrink “almost down to zero,” as Iran is expected to develop and use advanced centrifuges then… The official asserted that the reduction in the breakout time would be gradual because Iran’s stockpile of less enriched uranium would be limited for 15 years. But after that period, Iran could have a substantial enrichment capability. “It is going to be a gradual decline,” the official said. “At the end of, say, 15 years, we are not going to know what that is.”      An attack would achieve little except to buy the west time. Today’s deal … achieves little except to buy the west time, except Iran also gets many billions of dollars in economic stimulus via sanctions relief plus an influx of arms and ballistic missile technology when the UN embargoes on those are lifted within the next eight years plus, most importantly, the blessing of the international community once Iran begins enriching again at the end of the deal. What will the argument against Iran’s program be circa 2030 when they decide to install state-of-the-art centrifuges capable of producing enough enriched uranium for a bomb in days or even hours? We’re signing a deal today that allows them to do that. With this, the west formally endorses Iran as a nuclear state — just not in the near term, when President Precious rather than one of his successors would have to deal with the consequences.      So Obama’s a big winner today. Now he doesn’t have to think about this for the next 18 months, unless Iran is so stupid as to risk getting caught cheating before he leaves office in 2017. Iran, obviously, is the biggest winner. Kerry’s a winner in that he’ll now surely get a Nobel and a “legacy,” if not quite the one he’s expecting. The big losers are the Sunnis of the Middle East, who’ll need to scramble to counter an Iran that’s suddenly flush with cash and will have easier access to weapons by the end of the decade, and the American public, which will have an even worse headache from Iran’s nuclear program to deal with before the 2028 election than it has now.      Via the Free Beacon, here’s CNN anchor Jim Sciutto marveling that if you’d told the White House these would be the terms of the final deal a few years ago, they … wouldn’t have been too happy. Go figure. Two questions to ponder now. One: What’s the argument against giving, say, Saudi Arabia this exact same nuclear timeline — 10 years of no, or low, enrichment followed by the right to enrich their brains out with the international community’s blessing? The grand irony of this capitulation is that Obama, a guy who campaigned against nuclear proliferation, is effectively removing the taboo against new nuclear states. If you want to build a bomb, that’s fine, but you need to do it gradually, on the west’s schedule. Two: Obama and Kerry have no choice now but to aggressively pursue a grand bargain with Iran, right? The only way to neutralize an Iranian bomb after this is to make them so friendly to the west that they wouldn’t think of using it. And the clock is ticking on that given the near certainty that (a) a Republican will return to the White House sometime before 2028, when the deal will be winding down, and (b) that Republican will be far less inclined towards detente with Iran than Obama is. If Obama wants to bind the hands of his successors (or at least make it much harder for them to start a new cold war with Tehran), he needs to strike that grand bargain himself. Can’t wait to see the magic beans we get as part of that deal. ||||| President Obama announces Iran deal from the White House Tuesday morning.      President Obama announces Iran deal from the White House Tuesday morning.      Twenty months after formal negotiations began, Iran and six world powers have produced an agreement designed to curtail Iran's nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for lifting international economic and oil sanctions. The agreement requires Iran to reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent, mothball two-thirds of the centrifuges it uses to carry out enrichment, turn a once-secret centrifuge facility into a research center, redesign the Arak reactor that could produce plutonium for a bomb and open itself to the most intrusive nuclear inspection regime ever imposed on any nation.      Here is the entire text of the agreement. Here is a link to the president's address.      In an early morning address at the White House that was broadcast live in Iran, President Obama said compliance with the agreement is \\"not built on trust, it is built on verification.\\" He now faces what is certain to be a contentious debate in Congress over the deal a large percentage of Republicans—particularly the bomb-bomb-bomb crowd—as well as some Democrats will likely oppose:            But Mr. Obama made it abundantly clear that he would fight to preserve the deal in its entirety, saying, “I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal.” Not everyone was celebrating the accord. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called it a “historic mistake” that would ultimately create a “terrorist nuclear superpower.”      The agreement's foes will have a difficult path. They need a two-thirds majority to overcome any presidential vetoes and putting together that many votes in the matter seems out of reach.      Without an agreement, the Obama administration says, Iran currently has the technological skills, facilities and fissionable material to build a nuclear bomb within two to three months. Taken altogether the agreement extends this so-called \\"break-out\\" capacity to more than a year. In the latter years of the agreement, and something that foes of the deal will surely raise during debate, the break-out time will gradually dwindle as Iran is allowed to install more sophisticated centrifuges that can enrich uranium 20 times faster than the models it now uses. But by then the world could be a very different place.      Assuming nothing intervenes to block the agreement, which seems highly unlikely, it is a major diplomatic victory for President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and the negotiators of France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia. The agreement could also bring about an era of improved relations between the U.S. and Iran after 36 years of ferocious antagonism and a 12-year stand-off over Iran's nuclear program. That stand-off was punctuated by repeated right-wing calls for air attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities.      Any attacks, in addition to killing large numbers of Iranian civilians, would certainly have produced a strong military response from Iran, something the proponents chose to ignore the way they always ignore blowback and the other consequences of such actions. ||||| Josh Rogin is a Bloomberg View columnist who writes about national security and foreign affairs. He has previously worked for the Daily Beast, Newsweek, Foreign Policy magazine, the Washington Post, Congressional Quarterly and Asahi Shimbun. He is a graduate of the George Washington University.      The newly announced deal between Iran and six world powers is \\"akin to declaring war on Israel and the Sunni Arabs,\\" and will be a huge problem for Hillary Clinton, according to GOP presidential candidate and Senator Lindsey Graham, who promised to not uphold the deal if he is elected next year.      \\"My initial impression is that this deal is far worse than I ever dreamed it could be and will be a nightmare for the region, our national security and eventually the world at large,\\" Graham told me in an interview early Tuesday morning, just after Iran, China, France, Russia, Britain, the U.S. and Germany confirmed they had reached terms for a historic deal to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.      Graham reacted harshly to many of the details about the deal that were emerging early Tuesday, including the news that the conventional arms embargo on Iran will be largely lifted and replaced by a limitation of Iranian arms imports and exports for five years. Reports also stated early Tuesday that limitations on Iran's ballistic missile program will begin to ease after eight years.      \\"If the initial reports regarding the details of this deal hold true, there's no way as president of the United States I would honor this deal,\\" Graham said. \\"It's incredibly dangerous for our national security, and it's akin to declaring war on Sunni Arabs and Israel by the P5+1 because it ensures their primary antagonist Iran will become a nuclear power and allows them to rearm conventionally.\\"      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted Tuesday that the deal was \\"a historic mistake.\\" Hillary Clinton has not yet reacted publicly; in the past she has expressed cautious optimism about the deal and said she was waiting to see the details.      \\"Hillary Clinton's reaction to this deal is the first real test of her ability to be president and her judgment,\\" said Graham. \\"If she believes it's a good idea to lift the arms embargo without first seeing a behavior change by the Iranians, then her judgment as commander in chief will be very much in question.\\"      He said President Obama put Democrats in an impossible situation: \\"He's pitted Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party against common sense and the security of the American people.\\"      Congress will have 60 days to review the deal, after it is submitted to them by the administration. After that, Congress will have the option of debating and passing a resolution of approval or a resolution of disapproval, or doing nothing and letting the deal stand. If Congress passes a resolution of disapproval, the president is likely to veto it, and then Congress will struggle to muster an override vote.      Many Democrats have kept their powder dry, awaiting the details of the final deal. They will likely be looking toward Clinton for guidance, as she is the favorite to be the party's presidential nominee. The negotiations in Iran began while Clinton was secretary of state.      \\"She bears some responsibility for starting the process. The only question is, will she ratify the results,\\" said Graham.      In addition to the lifting of the embargo, Graham said lawmakers in both parties will be put off by the fact that the restrictions on Iranian enrichment expire over time. \\"There is no chance that this deal will be approved by Congress,\\" he said, predicting rejection by \\"an overwhelming super majority in both the House and the Senate.\\"      Graham also predicted that the deal would lead to an arms race in the Middle East and expanded hostilities between Shiite and Sunni Arabs all over the region. \\"If I had property in the Middle East, I would think about selling it after this deal.\\"      This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Nixon made a huge Cold War gamble that he could forge a working relationship with a Communist country that had built a small arsenal of nuclear weapons and clearly had long-term ambitions for global power.      For President Obama, the deal struck Tuesday morning with Iran represents a similar leap of faith, a bet that by defusing the country’s nuclear threat — even if just for a decade or so — he and his successors would have the time and space to restructure one of the United States’ deepest adversarial relationships.      Mr. Obama will be long out of office before any reasonable assessment can be made as to whether that roll of the dice paid off. The best guess today, even among the most passionate supporters of the president’s Iran project, is that the judgment will be mixed.      Little in the deal announced on Tuesday eliminates Iran’s ability to become a threshold nuclear power eventually — it just delays the day. To Mr. Obama’s many critics, including Henry A. Kissinger, the architect of the China opening, that is a fatal flaw. It does nothing, Mr. Kissinger wrote recently with another former secretary of state, George P. Shultz, to change “three and a half decades of militant hostility to the West.” ||||| The announcement of a historic deal with Iran curbing that country’s nuclear program makes it more likely that the 2016 election will be fought, at least partly, around a broad argument over the proper extent of U.S. international engagement as a means to solve the biggest future challenges we face.      It also means the presidential contenders will take sides around what has been called the Obama Doctrine: The idea that we should accept the limits of American power to enable us to solve these challenges on our own, even if that entails engaging internationally in ways that carry risks in their own right.      The details of the deal are listed right here. Congressional Republicans have already condemned it, while some key Senate Democrats — such as Tim Kaine of Virginia — are saying generally positive things while reserving judgment on the details. But the consensus this morning is that it will be very hard for Congress to block the deal from moving forward, at least in the short term. Because of the way Congress has structured its oversight mechanism, even if Congress disapproves of it, President Obama only needs just over one-third of one chamber to stick with his veto of that disapproval, which is very likely to happen.      Some of the major GOP presidential candidates — such as Scott Walker and Marco Rubio — have already pledged to undo an agreement with Iran, and crucially, they have said they will do so regardless of whether our allies want that deal to continue. Jeb Bush also condemned the previous framework.      By contrast, Hillary Clinton is likely to support the deal, though it remains to be seen how much hedging she’ll do along the way. Michael Crowley has a useful look at Clinton’s public statements on Iran, noting that she’s generally more hawkish than Obama but that she’s ultimately supportive of his diplomacy.      Thus, the argument that develops around the agreement may also take shape around the virtues and risks of international engagement. And this could join other issues to feed into a broader contrast, in which Republicans are opposing international engagement on multiple fronts — including Cuba and climate change (on which we may have an accord later this year). Meanwhile, Clinton may well embrace international engagement on multiple fronts, and use this contrast to cast the GOP as too inward looking and trapped in the past to confront the challenges of the future.      Peter Beinart argues provocatively that GOP opposition to the Iran deal is premised on a refusal to acknowledge the limits of American power. This puts Republicans in the position of opposing the deal mainly because there are risks associated with it, without offering any credible alternative. Obama described his international approach in similar terms in a recent interview with Thomas Friedman, who characterized the president’s position this way: America’s power may not be limitless, but it remains overwhelming, and the U.S. thus “needs to have the self-confidence to take some calculated risks to open important new possibilities.”      This doctrine also applies to engagement with Cuba and to an international climate accord (we don’t know whether other countries will keep up their end of the bargain). Beinart also suggests that the American mainstream may be more sympathetic to this worldview than pundits (who tend to give the Republican position the benefit of the doubt in such situations) think. I agree. While it’s hard to predict how the specifics of the Iran deal will play politically, Democrats should not fear this broader contrast. They should lean into it.      *******************************************************************      * THE IRAN DEAL, SUMMARIZED: The Wall Street Journal has a quick summary:      At the heart of the agreement between Iran and the six powers — the U.S., U.K., Russia, China, Germany and France — is Tehran’s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear activities for 10 years. These are supposed to ensure that the country remains a minimum of 12 months away from amassing enough nuclear fuel for a bomb. After the 10-year period, those constraints will ease in the subsequent five years. In exchange, the U.S., the European Union and the United Nations will lift tight international sanctions on Tehran, a move that Western diplomats say could help Iran’s economy to expand by 7% to 8% annually for years to come.      Daniel Larison makes the case for the deal on these grounds: “This will limit Iran’s nuclear program more effectively than a decade of sanctions and coercive methods ever did, and it makes Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear weapon much less likely than any other available course of action.”      * OBAMA VOWS VETO IN IRAN FIGHT: The President’s statement this morning:      “This deal is not built on trust. It is built on verification. Inspectors will have 24/7 access to Iran’s nuclear facilities…I am confident that this deal will meet the national security interests of the United States and our allies. So I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal. We do not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict.”      Republicans will argue that the deal is folly precisely because it requires us to “trust” Iran.      * OBAMA HOPES CONGRESS WILL BACK IRAN DEAL: The New York Times reports that Obama will likely get his way even if Congress disapproves of the deal, but he wants approval:      Mr. Obama’s chances of ultimately prevailing are considered high. Even if the accord is voted down by one or both houses, he could veto that action, and he is likely to have the votes he would need to prevail in an effort to override the veto. But he has told aides that for an accord as important as this one — which he hopes will usher in a virtual truce with a country that has been a major American adversary for 35 years — he wants a congressional endorsement.      But that would require Republicans — who have acted as if this deal is being negotiated by Obama and no one else — to endorse what they have already designated as Obama’s Capitulation To Iran.      * IRAN COULD BECOME ISSUE IN SENATE RACES: National Journal reports that Democrats think they can put Republican Senators on the defensive over their expected opposition to the deal. DSCC spokesman Justin Barasky notes that the public disapproved of Tom Cotton’s letter to Iran and will see opposition to the accord as obstructionist, adding: “I think they’re the ones that are going to have to deal with the voters in a way that’s problematic.”      Of course, a number of Senate Dems could oppose the deal. Notably, Congress now has 60 days to review it, which means that Senators and Members will catch an earful from voters back at home during the August recess.      * CAN PELOSI SAVE IRAN DEAL? Bloomberg reports that the White House is relying on Nancy Pelosi as the firewall against Congressional disapproval of the deal. If the Senate musters 67 votes to override Obama’s veto of a Congressional vote against it, the deal still moves forward for now if more than one-third of Members of the House side with Obama.      Reminder: 150 House Dems have already signed a letter backing an Iran deal in general, which means House Dems likely would sustain a veto, though that’s not assured.      * LEFT GEARS UP TO DEFEND AGREEMENT: The statement on the accord just out from MoveOn:      “MoveOn members are going to fight like hell to defend it and to stop opponents from dragging the U.S. into yet another costly, deadly war of choice….We call on every member of Congress to support this agreement.

This will not stop commentators from reflexively concluding that the politics of this will inveitably favor Republicans, of course. ||||| The United States and five other world powers have reached a deal with Iran that would place strict limits on Tehran’s nuclear program in return for ending sanctions on its economy, the culmination of years of delicate diplomacy pursued by President Barack Obama despite warnings the agreement could strengthen Iran’s Islamist regime and leave it dangerously close to a nuclear bomb.      The historic accord, reached by Secretary of State John Kerry and his international counterparts in Vienna on Tuesday after 18 days of intense negotiations, now faces review from a hostile Republican-led Congress, opposition from every GOP presidential candidate, from Israel’s government and from Sunni Arab monarchs. The deal’s long and complex implementation process also leaves it vulnerable to unraveling.      Story Continued Below      Speaking from the White House Tuesday morning, Obama called the deal a victory for diplomacy that would prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and avert a possible conflict with Iran.      “No deal means a greater chance of more war in the Middle East,” Obama said. He reaffirmed America’s commitment to Israel’s security and Gulf Arab states like Saudi Arabia, while adding that the U.S. is “open to engagement on the basis of mutual interests and mutual respect.”      Obama also hinted at the possibility of a larger thaw in U.S.-Iranian relations. ”It is possible to change,” Obama told Iranians, urging them to take a “different path, one of tolerance, of peaceful resolution to conflict… This deal opens an opportunity to move in a new direction. We should seize it.”      “This is the good deal that we have sought,” Kerry said in a statement from Vienna.      If it succeeds, the agreement could upgrade Obama’s checkered foreign policy legacy, as well provide a crowning achievement for Kerry’s 30-year political career. Analysts call it one of the modern era’s most important arms control agreements, in a league with the 1970 international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the 1994 START nuclear missile treaty between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.      Some believe it could begin to normalize relations between Iran and the West after three decades of cold war, although Obama and Kerry have denied that is their goal, while others predict that an emboldened Iran will seek greater dominance across the Middle East. But on Tuesday the European Union’s top foreign policy official, Frederica Mogherini, called the pact “much more than a nuclear deal,” adding: “It can open a new chapter.”      On Twitter, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani said that with the “unnecessary crisis resolved, new horizons emerge with a focus on shared challenges.”      That will hardly please Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who tweeted: “From the initial reports we can already conclude that this agreement is a historic mistake.”      According to a 159-page document posted online by Russia’s foreign ministry, which it called the final text of the deal, a U.N. resolution lifting sanctions will also express the Security Council’s “desire to build a new relationship with Iran.”      The text says also that Iran has vowed that “under no circumstances” will it ever “seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.” And it describes a joint commission composed of its seven parties to monitor the deal’s implementation.      One issue that will draw close scrutiny from nuclear experts is Iran’s ability to research advanced nuclear technologies while its program is constrained by a deal. Iran now relies on 1970s-era centrifuges to enrich uranium, which are highly inefficient. The document posted by Russian foreign ministry says that after 8½ years Iran can begin testing up to 30 modern IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges. Analysts fear that, if Iran masters top-quality centrifuges, it might be capable of producing a bomb in a matter of months or weeks soon after the deal’s main restrictions lift in a decade.      On an issue that snagged the talks in their final days, the deal will free Iran from an arms embargo after five years, Obama said Tuesday.      Obama has made the deal a central plank of his foreign policy. Dating from early in the 2008 presidential campaign, he called for fresh thinking toward American adversaries like Iran. As president, he has argued that it is wiser to negotiate with a nemesis of more than three decades than risk a military confrontation over Iran’s nuclear ambitions.            But he has also insisted, in response to the many critics who called him desperate for a deal, that signing off on a weak agreement is not in his interest. “If Iran has a nuclear weapon, it’s my name on this,” the president said in May — a measure of just how keenly aware he is of the deal’s implications for his legacy.      The deal came 18 days after Kerry arrived in Vienna for a round of talks whose initial deadline was June 30. As early July came and went, the talks bogged down in a handful of issues, including whether and how to lift a U.N. embargo on Iran’s import and export of conventional arms.      Kerry, too, was accused of wanting a deal too badly, a charge his marathon session in Vienna — all of it on crutches, as he recovers from a broken leg — may have defused.      The comprehensive deal fills in the details of a preliminary framework deal reached in April by the U.S. and its negotiating partners — France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia. A document said to be about 100 pages will be transmitted to Congress and made public, although some portions are expected to remain classified.      Obama’s main goal has been to impose limits on Iran’s fast-advancing nuclear program to ensure that Tehran can’t acquire a nuclear bomb faster than the U.S. and its allies can act to stop it. The deal seeks to do that by reducing Iran’s capacity to produce highly enriched uranium and plutonium, slowing its research and development into nuclear technology, and imposing inspections and monitoring of Iran’s nuclear activities to prevent cheating.      The goal is to achieve a “breakout time” — or the time it would take Iran to produce the nuclear material required for one bomb — of at least one year. That is long enough, U.S. officials believe, for the world community to take punitive action that could include airstrikes against Iranian facilities.      Some elements of the deal were locked in by an April 2 political framework agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland. They include a commitment by Iran to reduce its number of installed centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, with only 5,060 of those enriching uranium for 10 years. Centrifuges spin gaseous uranium at supersonic speeds to increase its purity to levels suitable for a nuclear weapon.      Iran has also agreed to modify a plutonium-fueled nuclear reactor so that its fuel cannot be reprocessed for use in a weapon. And it will allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency broad access to suspected nuclear sites, as well as cooperate with an IAEA investigation into its past activities, although many crucial details have yet to be released.      The comprehensive agreement will leave many powerful critics deeply dissatisfied. Netanyahu, who sees Iran as an existential threat to his country, has said repeatedly that the deal will “pave Iran’s path to the bomb”; several Sunni Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia, worry that the end of sanctions will free up tens of billions of dollars that Iran can direct to militant allies like Hezbollah and sectarian battles from Iraq to Syria to Yemen.      The emerging outlines of the deal have also drawn withering fire for months from Capitol Hill, fueled by Republicans — and many Democrats — who agree with Netanyahu that it jeopardizes Israel’s security. A vote of disapproval by Congress would prevent Obama from lifting sanctions on Tehran, although administration officials believe they can maintain enough Democratic backing to sustain a presidential veto.      The nuclear talks began after years of Western worry over Iran’s nuclear aims, despite Tehran’s insistence that its program was only for scientific and energy purposes.      The 2002 revelation of Iran’s uranium enrichment plant at Natanz and a plutonium reactor at Arak — sites previously undeclared to the U.N. in violation of Iran’s international commitments — badly undercut Tehran’s claims. So did the 2009 discovery of a secret, underground enrichment facility buried in a mountain at Fordow, near the holy city of Qom.      In 2007, an assessment by the U.S. intelligence community found that Iran had pursued a military dimension to its nuclear program — in effect, an Iranian Manhattan Project — but ceased the work in 2003. Iran has failed to comply fully with IAEA inspectors pursuing the question, a major point of contention in the talks.      The United States, which broke off diplomatic relations with Iran after the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution and capture of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has long used sanctions and other tools to punish Iran for its behavior. In recent years the sanctions vice tightened considerably as Russia and China backed harsh U.N. measures, the U.S. Congress targeted Iran’s financial sector, and the Obama administration persuaded growing economies like India and South Korea agreed to sharply limit their consumption of Iranian oil.      At the same time, after taking office Obama continued a Bush-era program targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure with cyberwar, in the form of the Stuxnet virus, which delayed Iran’s enrichment program.      The U.S., U.N. and EU sanctions badly hurt Iran’s economy; inflation soared above 40 percent in 2013. U.S. sanctions threatening to punish foreign financial institutions for doing business with Iran landed a particularly painful blow.      In mid-2012, after exchanging messages through the Arab state of Oman, Iranian and American officials secretly met to lay the groundwork for potential nuclear talks. This involved diplomats dispatched by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, including her close aide Jake Sullivan, now a top adviser to her presidential campaign.      Talks became possible in June 2013, after Iranians elected as president a relatively moderate Iranian cleric, Hassan Rouhani. He offered the West a more conciliatory face than his hardline predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.      With the apparent blessing of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final word on all state decisions in Iran, Rouhani spoke directly via phone with Obama in September 2013, kicking off the public phase of the nuclear talks.      Despite a willingness to bargain over its nuclear program, Iran has pursued an aggressive foreign policy elsewhere in the Middle East, alarming its neighbors.      For example, Iran is backing Syrian President Bashar Assad against Sunni groups trying to topple him. At the same time, Iranian-trained Shiite militias are indirectly helping U.S.-backed Iraqi troops trying to defeat the Islamic State terrorist group in Iraq. And in Yemen, Iran has backed the Houthi rebels, whose positions are being bombed by Saudi Arabia with U.S. assistance.            Critics of the deal fear that once Iran starts to get relief from sanctions — including access to more than 100 billion in frozen assets — it will use the money to wreak more havoc in the region.      U.S. officials argue that Iran’s regional meddling costs little, and that the country is more likely to direct the influx of funds to repairing its economy and its infrastructure. At the same time, Obama has promised more military aid to Arab countries and repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment to Israel’s security.      In many ways, the hardest part of the nuclear deal begins now, with its implementation.      Congress will review the deal, and is likely to vote to prevent Obama from suspending sanctions on Iran — a measure Obama is sure to veto. In that scenario, the votes of a few dozen Senate Democrats could become decisive in a veto override battle.      The nuclear deal will also drive the 2016 presidential campaign’s foreign policy debate. Several Republican contenders are already vowing to kill the deal if they win the White House.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"The answer to both questions asked, \\"What is the best sword?\\" and \\"What is the best type of sword in the world?\\" would indeed be closely related; however, the answer might not be exactly the same because of how these questions are framed, which focuses on separate aspects of the topic. In answering \\"What is the best sword?\\" it would be important to define what is meant by \\"best\\". Is it the sharpest, the most durable, the most historically significant, the most expensive or the most aesthetically pleasing? 'Best' is subjective and can refer to many different factors. For instance, some might argue that historically, the katana, a Japanese longsword used by samurai, is the best due to its sharpness, flexibility, and hardness. Others might argue that the Damascus Sword, known for its unique patterning and legendary sharpness, durability, and resistance to shattering, is the best. On the other hand, when trying to answer \\"What is the best type of sword in the world?\\" we would also need to consider cultural, historical, and practical aspects. Different types of swords have been developed throughout history and across cultures depending on the needs and resources of those societies. A Longsword from medieval Europe, for example, was designed for different kinds of warfare than a Scimitar from the Middle East or a Rapier from Renaissance Europe. Specific types of swords might include the Katana (Japan), Longsword (Europe), Jian (China), Scimitar (Middle East), Khopesh (Egypt), and Rapier (Renaissance Europe). Each type has distinctive features and was created to meet specific requirements.  The Katana, for instance, is revered for its sharpness and is best for quick, precise cuts. The Longsword gives the best results in a range of fighting situations due to its balanced design. The Jian excels in precision and agility, making it suitable for subtle techniques as seen in several martial arts. A Scimitar is considered optimal for horseback combat due to its curved design, which is good for slashing. The Khopesh was technologically superior during its time, with its sickle-like shape offering both slashing and hooking capabilities. A Rapier, while limited in slashing effectiveness, is unmatched in offering quick thrusting attacks. The key point is that the concept of 'the best' can depend largely on the context and the criteria by which 'best' is judged. What works best in one scenario might not work as well in another. Thus, the best sword or sword type is fundamentally determined by what it is that you need or want the sword to do – whether that be display, collection, combat, historical reenactment or something else entirely. Therefore, while the answer to the two questions may indeed be similar, they should also address these individual aspects of each query. The responses could indeed reference the same types of swords based on these factors, but they could also differ based on how 'best' is interpreted in each context.  The given options (i). no. (ii). yes. do not seem to relate to these questions as they imply a yes or no response. Both questions require a much more nuanced and detailed answer than a simple yes or no. Therefore, focusing purely on these options would neither adequately satisfy the questions nor necessarily provide a logically coherent response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a summary based on this article: Over the dissents of three Justices, the Supreme Court on Tuesday evening barred Texas from enforcing two parts of its new abortion-restriction law — one part as it applied throughout the state, the other as it applied to two clinics in the southwest part of the state.      The state may not now enforce a requirement that all clinics in the state upgrade their facilities to be hospital-like surgical centers, even when they perform abortions only through the use of drugs, not surgery. And it may not enforce, against the clinics in McAllen and El Paso, a requirement that all doctors performing abortions have privileges to admit patients to a hospital within thirty miles of the clinic. That requirement can continue to be enforced elsewhere in Texas, the Court indicated.      Those two provisions, together, had reduced the number of clinics still operating in the state to seven, with an eighth soon to open. At one time recently, Texas had forty-one clinics. The Supreme Court’s action Tuesday will allow the reopening of thirteen closed clinics on Wednesday, lawyers for the clinics said.      The Court’s order will remain in effect while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rules on a constitutional challenge to the two measures. That court had previously upheld the admitting privileges requirement as it applied all across the state. Most recently, it had blocked a new ruling by a judge in Austin that seemed to invalidate the two provisions statewide.      The Supreme Court gave no explanation for the four-sentence order. It noted that Justices Samuel A. Alito, Jr., Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas would have refused to delay any part of the state requirements. They did not give their reasoning. It would have taken the votes of five Justices to block the provisions, so it appears that at least that number from among the other six Justices voted for the result. The Justices voting for the order were not noted.      In asking the Court to set aside, temporarily, the Fifth Circuit’s orders permitting enforcement of the two provisions, lawyers for the clinics had said that clinics closed as a result probably would not reopen unless those restrictions were lifted. They also contended that there had recently been an increase in the number of women seeking illegal abortions in areas where clinics could no longer provide services.      The seven clinics that were not affected by the new restrictions (and the eighth that is soon to open) were concentrated in the four largest metropolitan areas in the eastern part of the state. The lawyers had told the Court that, for the time being, there were no licensed facilities to provide abortions anywhere in the state south or west of San Antonio — “an area larger than most states.”      Texas officials had urged the Supreme Court not to block the new measures, arguing that they were necessary to protect the health of pregnant women in the state. They also argued that the challengers had exaggerated the practical impact of the new restrictions, and that most women would continue to have access to abortions within what they said was a reasonable driving distance.      The Fifth Circuit, in allowing the restrictions to go into or remain in effect, had found that they would not impose an “undue burden” on a significant fraction of the women in the state who would need abortion services.      The Supreme Court’s order is not a final ruling on the constitutionality of the new limitations, but is a strong indication that the state may have difficulty defending them, at least as statewide measures.      The Court’s order marked the first time in the Justices’ new Term that the abortion controversy had returned. There may be other tests of the Court’s current view on that controversy later in the Term.      Recommended Citation: Lyle Denniston, Court blocks abortion limits in Texas, SCOTUSblog (Oct. 14, 2014, 7:08 PM), http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/10/court-blocks-abortion-limits-in-texas/ ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked key parts of a 2013 law in Texas that had closed all but eight facilities providing abortions in America's second most-populous state.      In an unsigned order, the justices sided with abortion rights advocates and health care providers in suspending an Oct. 2 ruling by a panel of the New Orleans-based U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas could immediately apply a rule making abortion clinics statewide spend millions of dollars on hospital-level upgrades.      The court also put on hold a separate provision of the law only as it applies to clinics in McAllen and El Paso that requires doctors at the facilities to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The admitting privileges remains in effect elsewhere in Texas.      Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas said they would have ruled against the clinics in all respects.      The 5th Circuit is still considering the overall constitutionality of the sweeping measure overwhelmingly passed by the GOP-controlled Texas Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry last year.      But even as it weighs the merits of the law, the appeals court said that it can be enforced in the meantime — opening the door for the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court.      The 5th Circuit decision had blocked an August ruling by Austin-based U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel, who had found that requiring hospital-style upgrades was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult. Yeakel's ruling temporarily suspended the upgrade rules before they could go into effect Sept. 1 — and the order from the Supreme Court means they are on hold again.      Allowing the rules on hospital-level upgrades to be enforced — including mandatory operating rooms and air filtration systems — shuttered more than a dozen clinics across Texas.      Until the nation's highest court intervened, only abortion facilities in the Houston, Austin, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth areas remained open. And none was left along the Texas-Mexico border or outside any of the state's largest urban areas.      Some other clinics, meanwhile, had closed even earlier amid enforcement of the rule on admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. That portion has already been upheld twice by the appeals court.      The fight over the Texas law is the latest over tough new abortion restrictions that have been enacted across the country. The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican who is the favorite in next month's governor's race, is leading the defense of the law.      Critics call the measure a backdoor effort to outlaw abortions.      Attorneys for the state have denied that Texas women would be burdened by fewer abortion facilities, saying nearly 9 in 10 would still live within 150 miles of a provider. The law's opponents, however, note that still leaves nearly a million Texas women embarking on drives longer than three hours to get an abortion.      Democrat Wendy Davis launched her campaign for governor behind the celebrity she achieved through a nearly 13-hour filibuster last summer that temporarily blocked the law in the state Senate.      ___      Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report from Austin, Texas. ||||| Summary:","output":"The Supreme Court has barred Texas from enforcing two parts of its 2013 abortion restriction law, enabling the reopening of 13 clinics. One part of the law blocked requires all state clinics to upgrade their facilities to be like hospital surgical centers, even those that perform abortions purely through the use of drugs. The replacement of this law applies throughout the state. The other aspect cannot be enforced against clinics in McAllen and El Paso which specify that all doctors performing these operations have privileges to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. This second requirement can continue elsewhere in Texas. The Supreme Court's order is only temporary and will remain in place while the Fifth Circuit Court rules on a constitutional challenge to these measures.

Please answer the following question: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

Instead, like every other Rocky/Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market, it's about conquering adversity with stick-to-it-iveness, rendering all social/personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome - with love interest standing by of course. Ronald Reagan top to bottom, in short; so as a piece of cinema it's down to the details. Some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up - especially the love interest, brought to you by none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, warming up for Ted; heroine Olivia D'Abo's hateful alkie dad and big-hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch-nemeses/teammates, one of whom appears to be made of porcelain.

Instead, the monarch directly grants royal assent by Order in Council. Assent is granted or refused on the advice of the Lord Chancellor. A recent example when assent was refused (or, more correctly, when the Lord Chancellor declined to present the law for assent) was in 2007, concerning reforms to the constitution of the Chief Pleas of Sark. (A revised version of the proposed reforms was subsequently given assent.) In 2011, campaigners against a law that sought to reduce the number of senators in the states of Jersey petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse royal assent. An Order in Council of 13 July 2011 established new rules for the consideration of petitions against granting royal assent. Who advises a bill to be granted or refused?","output":"The Lord Chancellor advises whether a bill should be granted or refused royal assent. In the monarch's name, the Lord Chancellor can grant royal assent through an Order in Council, which involves receiving advice on each piece of legislation. This advice determines if the monarch should give assent, and thus full legal authority, to it or not. A notable recent instance when this advice led to the refusal of assent was in 2007, regarding proposed amendments to the constitution of the Chief Pleas of Sark. However, a revised version of these reforms was later granted assent. In another case in 2011, campaigners against a proposed law aiming at reducing the number of senators in the states of Jersey petitioned the Privy Council to suggest the Queen refuse royal assent to the said law. This led to an Order in Council on 13th July 2011, establishing new guidelines for considering petitions against the granting of royal assent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: She's the One Context: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\". One day, Mickey picks up Heather in his cab and goes up to her apartment to retrieve a television that belonged to him...

If your home was built before 1978 and you want to renovate it, you should test the area first to check for lead. Testing kits are easy to use and available at most home improvement or hardware stores.","output":"First, you need to purchase a testing kit suitable for testing lead paint. Once you have the testing kit, prepare the area that you intend to test by cleaning it with a damp cloth to remove dust or loose particles. This is important because lead can often be mixed with dust, and you want to ensure you are testing the surface paint and not contaminated dust.  Following the instructions on the kit, typically you will need to rub a testing swab against the painted surface for a given amount of time or until the swab changes colour. If the swab changes to a specific colour (usually pink or red), this indicates the presence of lead. It's best to test in various places, including window sills, door frames, and walls - essentially, wherever there is paint.  If the test comes back positive for lead, do not try to handle the situation yourself. While it may be tempting to try and remove the lead paint on your own, improper handling can lead to lead dust being released into the air, which can be harmful if inhaled, especially for children and pregnant women.  Instead, contact professionals who are certified in lead removal. These professionals have the necessary training and equipment to safely remove or manage lead paint. This can involve a wide range of activities including enclosing the lead paint with a wall covering, painting over the lead paint with a special type of paint known as encapsulant, or completely removing the lead paint. In the meantime, limit access to the area proven to have lead paint, especially for children and pets. Keep the area clean by wet moping the surfaces and washing hands and toys often to reduce the risk of lead contamination. While the lead paint removal process may seem daunting, remember that it is a necessary precaution in ensuring the safety of your home. Always remember to take the proper precautions when dealing with lead paint and never hesitate to seek professional help if you are unsure."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If you’re collecting a sample from the tap, let the water run for at least 1 minute. Then, fill the glass so it’s at least ¾ of the way full. This is more than enough to spot anything out of the ordinary in a sample. For pools of water, scoop up a sample with the glass. You don’t need to sterilize the glass first. Think of the crystal clear water at a beautiful beach. Clean water looks transparent and doesn’t have anything floating in it. If you can’t see your hand on the other side of the glass, you’re probably not going to enjoy drinking that water. Anything floating in the glass could be a sign of bacteria or other problems.  Before getting on the phone with your water department, set the glass down and wait for a minute. Sometimes milky water clears up right away. That means the color came from air bubbles, so your water is safe to drink.  Hard water is water that has calcium, magnesium, and other minerals in it. The minerals cause the water to look a little cloudy. It is usually safe to drink but can be fixed with a water softener to avoid damage to your plumbing. Treat water with colored particles. For example, brown or orange particles are from rusty pipes while black ones come from rubber. Call a plumber to fix the problem. Even if your water doesn’t have anything floating in it, it may still not look completely clear. Discolored water not only looks gross but is a big red flag. These colors also turn up as stains on your dishes, clothing, bathtub, and other places. Use the strange coloring to figure out the source of the contamination before paying for a more comprehensive purity test.  For instance, brown water is a very common problem. The contamination comes from dirt and other sediments, which you might see settle at the bottom of the glass. Red and orange colors come from rusty pipes. Black could mean you have lead in the water, a very toxic metal that also often comes from pipes. Green usually means algae grew in your water supply, so don’t drink it. If it has a blue-green coloring, it could be copper instead. A black stain could also mean mold. If the water smells bad, play it safe by assuming that it is going to be unsafe to drink. Sometimes water has that distinct rotten egg smell of sulfur, which comes from bacteria in the water. Other times, it could have the smell of a swimming pool because of chlorine contamination.  If your water smells like nail polish or varnish, that could mean that some chemical leaked into the water supply. It might be from a home improvement project, for instance.  Purify water by filtering and boiling it to remove contaminants. If you’re using municipal water, call your city or utility company. Contact your local government for more information. If you don’t see anything unusual about the water, taste a little bit of it with the tip of your tongue. You can usually detect polluted water right away. Bitterness often means metal in the water, so order a more complete water test as you look for problems. If you detect salt instead and live near the sea, seawater could be leaking into your plumbing.  Clean water has a flat, bland taste. If your sample tastes metallic or like a fizzy soda, don’t risk drinking it. Keep in mind that you can’t always taste water quality issues. Things like bacteria and pesticides may not be easy to detect. Normally you can tell by looking at the water, but double-check with a lab test if necessary. Summary:","output":"Okay kiddo, imagine that you and I are detectives. We are going to solve a mystery about how our water looks or tastes. First, if we want to test our tap water, we let it run for a little bit, then fill up a glass. If we're checking a pool of water, we just scoop some up.  The water should look clear, with nothing floating in it - like a beautiful beach. If we can't see our hand through the glass, it might not be good to drink. If something's floating, there could be germs or other yucky stuff. But sometimes, we might just see tiny bubbles which are harmless. Sometimes, our water might look cloudy because it has minerals like calcium and magnesium, which is okay to drink but could be a little hard on our pipes. We might also see weird colors in the water. For example, brown or orange colors could mean rusty pipes, while black could be because of rubber or even a dangerous thing called lead. We might even see green color because of algae, or a blue-green color from copper. If it smells bad, like a rotten egg or nail polish, it could have bacteria or chemicals in it. And guess what, if it tastes bitter it might have metal in it, or even seawater if we live near the beach. If the water tastes, smells or looks funny, we shouldn't drink it. Sometimes, we might not be able to taste or see anything wrong, but we can send a sample to a lab to make sure it's safe.

It's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of \\" style over substance\\" I couldn't disagree more. I believe that \\" Domino \\" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film-making career.  After having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema. As early as \\"Crimson Tide\\" Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters- the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutched-angle framing. This was then carried through to \\" Enemy Of The State\\" and \\"Spy Game\\" which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively.  \\" Man On Fire\\" was an extreme departure , a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic. Here Scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive rage . Although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in \\" Domino\\" Couched in the framing device of an FBI interrogation \\" Domino\\" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory. She grasps at memories as we all do- in fragments, flashes and brief snatches. As Domino relays her story verbally Scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them. She does have \\" traces of mescaline\\" in her system but her individual vision is anyway Unusual -that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting.  It is when Domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that Scott really lets rip. Together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. Gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be Domino is no more disjointed than the \\"90210\\" culture she has rejected. As she wades through this cultural melange Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces. Ultimately Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip.  To criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human. Like any great painting the meaning in \\" Domino\\" is in the surface and the surface is everything.  I am not in any way associated with Scott Free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of Tony Scott's work What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is highly positive. The reviewer enthusiastically praises \\"Domino\\" and its director, Tony Scott, arguing passionately against detractors who condemn the movie for its alleged superficiality and frenzied style. In the review, the author asserts that \\"Dominos\\" is not just an action movie, but a cinematically rich exploration of the main character's subjective experience, with highly intentioned stylistic and aesthetic choices. The reviewer highlights how Scott's changing stylistic techniques over different movies culminated in \\"Domino\\", creating a visual narrative that represents the disarrayed memories of the main character.  Moreover, the reviewer admires how Scott, together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams, crafted a vivid depiction of contemporary American culture, evoking the loss of innocence through the journey of the underprivileged children in the movie. The reviewer implies that \\"Dominos\\" is similar to the works of Picasso or Pollock, where the surface, though not traditionally \\"realistic\\", is full of meaning and depth. Finally, the reviewer emotionally asserts their independent status, fervently stating their unwavering admiration for Tony Scott's work. Therefore, the reviewer not only provides their resounding endorsement for \\"Domino\\" but also expresses their deep respect for Tony Scott's career, viewing him as an avant-garde filmmaker whose visionary style elevates his movies into an expressionist art form on par with great paintings.

An amateur who breaches the rules of amateur status may lose his or her amateur status. A golfer who has lost his or her amateur status may not play in amateur competitions until amateur status has been reinstated; a professional may not play in amateur tournaments unless the Committee is notified, acknowledges and confirms the participation. It is very difficult for a professional to regain his or her amateur status; simply agreeing not to take payment for a particular tournament is not enough. A player must apply to the governing body of the sport to have amateur status reinstated.  - Prestwick is a town in South Ayrshire on the south-west coast of Scotland, about south-west of Glasgow.

Appended to the last book, however, is a self-contained essay on aesthetics, which Durer worked on between 1512 and 1528, and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning 'ideal beauty'. Durer rejected Alberti's concept of an objective beauty, proposing a relativist notion of beauty based on variety. Nonetheless, Durer still believed that truth was hidden within nature, and that there were rules which ordered beauty, even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code. In 1512/13 his three criteria were function ('Nutz'), naive approval ('Wohlgefallen') and the happy medium ('Mittelmass'). However, unlike Alberti and Leonardo, Durer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images. Between 1512 and the final draft in 1528, Durer's belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of 'selective inward synthesis'. In other words, that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things. Durer's belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that \\"one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day, or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron, and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another's work at which its author labours with the utmost diligence for a whole year.\\"  Question: \\"How many years passed between the first and final drafts of Durer's essay on aesthetics?\\" Answer: \\"16 years had passed since his first draft\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct. 16 years passed between the first draft in 1512 and the final draft in 1528 of Durer's essay on aesthetics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Parents get deported, leaving kids despondent and hopeless. Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more. The saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework. She waited until after grades were turned in at the end of the year to contest the “D” on her report card because it meant not going to UC Berkeley. She brought her mother with her, and her two sisters. After going around and around for a while with me and the principal, her mother said that her divorce had really affected this girl, and she had been fighting so hard all her life to get into Berkeley, and what did I have against her daughter? She deserved to go to Cal! They were all in tears. The principal found a way to change her 64% to a 70.01%, and off she went. This young woman full of potential and energy, learned from her mother and my boss, that excuses rule the day. She appears to think that “social justice” means fighting to get your way because the deck is stacked against you, instead of doing the right thing. This is sad. I know this isn’t what you were after, and that this memory says more about me than it does about her. Many other kids I have counseled, who are getting through something life-changing, seem to understand that life is in session, there will always be challenges to rise above, and that focusing in the classroom is a great way to get one’s mind off one’s troubles, if the environment is supportive and the spirit is willing.

In this case, we will move the +17 to the right side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 17 from both sides of the equation. -17*k + 17 - 17 = 0 - 17 This simplifies to: -17*k = -17 Step 3: Solve for k Now we need to solve for k. Since k is being multiplied by -17, we must divide both sides of the equation by -17 to get k by itself. -17*k / -17 = -17 / -17 This simplifies to: k = 1 So the solution to the equation -17*k - 2 + 19 = 0 is k = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which village has more dangerous cycling conditions?  Two villages are inhabited by lots of people that ride bicycles. Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, and Low village is situated in a valley, and has more sunny days.  Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] Answer:","output":"Hill village has more dangerous cycling conditions. The paragraph states that Hill village is located on a mountain and gets lots of rain, which can create slippery conditions. This increases the risk of loss of control for cyclists, especially those who ride brakeless and have to brake through the drivetrain. Additionally, descending any significant gradient in Hill village can be more difficult due to the need for a fast spin or use of brakes to slow down. In contrast, Low village has more sunny days, which implies better cycling conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Anxiety: While anticipation can bring a sense of excitement, it can also cause some anxiety. Carson may be nervous about the final exam and how well he'll perform. Even though he spent all week preparing, there's always the possibility of encountering unexpected and challenging questions. Carson might feel even more pressure to succeed, given the amount of time he invested in studying. 5. Exhaustion: A week of intense studying can be physically and mentally draining. Carson may feel worn out after cramming so much information into a short period of time. This exhaustion might make him look forward to having a break or some relaxation time after the exam. 6. Anticipation: After studying so hard, Carson is likely eager to test his newfound knowledge and put it to good use. He might look forward to the exam as it presents an opportunity to demonstrate his understanding of the course material. Furthermore, this anticipation of the final exam might be coupled with eagerness to see the results and learn how well he performed. In summary, after spending an entire week preparing for the final exam, Carson is likely to experience a mix of relief, satisfaction, confidence, anxiety, exhaustion, and anticipation.

A basic closing with the word \\" sincerely \\" can be safely used with almost any kind of letter. When you're done writing the letter, the basic closing is appropriate for almost all kinds of letters.","output":"To end a letter sincerely using \\"sincerely,\\" follow these steps: 1. Finish the main body of your letter: Ensure that you have covered all the necessary points, expressed your thoughts clearly, and addressed any concerns or questions your reader might have. Proofread your letter for errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies to ensure your message is clear and professional. 2. Leave a space below the last paragraph: After completing the main body of the letter, skip a line, which helps to create a visual separation between the content and your closing. 3. Choose the right closing phrase: In most cases, the word \\"Sincerely\\" is a suitable choice for both formal and personal letters. However, you may also consider using \\"Yours sincerely\\" or \\"Sincerely yours\\" as alternatives. If the letter is more casual or informal, you might opt for closings like \\"Best regards,\\" \\"Kind regards,\\" or \\"Warm regards\\" instead. 4. Add a comma after the closing phrase: Regardless of the specific closing phrase you choose, be sure to follow it with a comma. This helps to provide a clear separation between your chosen phrase and your signature. 5. Skip a few lines for your signature: After adding the closing phrase and comma, skip three or four lines. This space is meant for your handwritten or digital signature, which adds a personal and authentic touch to your letter. 6. Add your typed name and contact information (if applicable): Below the space left for your signature, type your full name. Depending on the context of the letter and your relationship with the recipient, you may choose to include additional contact information, such as your phone number, email address, or mailing address, below your typed name. 7. Sign the letter (if applicable): If you are printing the letter, sign your name in the space left between the closing phrase and your typed name using a pen with a blue or black ink. If you are sending the letter electronically, you can use a digital signature tool to create and insert your signature in the designated space. This is not necessary for informal messages or when using email. By following these steps, you can effectively end a letter sincerely using \\"sincerely\\" or an alternative phrase that suits the tone and purpose of your letter.

Fact 2: Folding and metamorphic rock Folding is caused by slow compression and the rock responds by bending.  Given the two facts above, what caused the Himalayas to form? Answer:","output":"The formation of the Himalayas is a complex and fascinating geological process, which can be understood in conjunction with the two facts provided above. The cause behind the formation of this majestic mountain range can be linked to the theory of plate tectonics and the interactions between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Plate tectonics is a theory in Earth science that describes the large-scale motion and interaction of Earth's lithosphere, the outermost solid shell of our planet that is made up of the crust and the upper mantle. The lithosphere is fragmented into a number of mobile tectonic plates that are in constant motion, albeit at a very slow rate. These plates float on Earth's semi-fluid asthenosphere and move due to the convection currents generated by heat generated within Earth's interior. The formation of the Himalayas can be traced back to around 50 million years ago when the Indian Plate, which was part of the ancient continent Gondwana, began to move northwards and collided with the Eurasian Plate. This continental collision, known as the Indo-Asian Collision, initiated the formation of the Himalayas through a series of geological processes, including folding and the formation of metamorphic rocks. As stated in Fact 1, the Himalayas were formed by rock folding. Folding is a geological process wherein rocks bend and deform under immense pressure and stress, typically caused by the horizontal compression forces exerted during the collision of tectonic plates. In the case of the Himalayas, the immense pressure created during the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate led to the deformation and bending of the rock layers along the boundary. As the Indian Plate continued to push against the Eurasian Plate, layers of rock were squeezed, compressed, and bent, forming the folded mountain ranges that characterize the Himalayas. This process is still ongoing, as evidenced by the fact that the height of the Himalayas continues to increase each year. Folding and the formation of metamorphic rock, as mentioned in Fact 2, are closely related processes. Metamorphic rock forms when pre-existing rock undergoes changes in response to variations in temperature, pressure, or chemical conditions. During the formation of the Himalayas, the intense stress and pressure experienced by the rocks at the boundary of the colliding plates were sufficient to induce metamorphism. As the rocks bent and deformed, they were also transformed into metamorphic rocks like gneiss, schist, and marble, which can be found throughout the Himalayan range today. In conclusion, the formation of the Himalayas was driven by the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate during the process of plate tectonics. This continental collision led to folding and deformation of the rocks along the plate boundary due to immense pressure and stress, as well as the formation of metamorphic rocks. The continuous movement and interaction between these tectonic plates mean that the Himalayas are still undergoing these geological processes and continue to evolve over time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To curb his influence, he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital. Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism. Furthermore, people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer. Wang Yangming's disciple and salt-mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives, while his follower He Xinyin (何心隱) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society. His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education; both Li and He eventually died in prison, jailed on charges of spreading \\"dangerous ideas\\". Yet these \\"dangerous ideas\\" of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy, painting, and poetry as their male guests.The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain.

România, ca orice altă țară, este într-adevăr confruntată cu numeroase provocări serioase care afectează diferite aspecte ale societății. În primul rând, să examinăm unele dintre cele mai pregnante probleme cu care se confruntă România în prezent: 1. Economie: Economia românească este în continuă creștere și dezvoltare, dar avansează încet comparativ cu alte țări din Uniunea Europeană. Problemele care afectează economia includ nivelurile ridicate ale datoriei publice, infrastructura slabă și corupția. 2. Educație: Sectorul educației este încă afectat de subfinanțare și lipsa resurselor, ceea ce duce la rezultate slabe ale elevilor și scăderea calității învățământului. 3. Sănătate: Sistemul de sănătate românesc se confruntă cu provocări majore, cum ar fi lipsa personalului medical, lipsa echipamentelor și resurselor necesare pentru oferirea unei îngrijiri medicale adecvate, precum și corupția la nivel înalt. 4. Mediu: Poluarea și degradarea mediului sunt probleme grave în România, având în vedere ratele ridicate de emisii de gaz cu efect de seră, tăierile ilegale de păduri și problemele legate de calitatea apei. 5. Corupție și guvernanță: România continuă să lupte cu corupția la toate nivelurile guvernamentale, conducând la o gestionare ineficientă și lipsirea de încredere a cetățenilor în instituții. Eforturile de eradicare a corupției, întreprinse pe plan național și în colaborare cu alte țări și organizații internaționale, încă sunt în desfășurare. 6. Demografie și migrație: Populația României este în scădere din cauza ratei reduse a natalității, a îmbătrânirii populației și a emigrației forței de muncă, în special către țări din Europa de Vest cu economii mai dezvoltate. Aceasta provoacă lipsa forței de muncă și pune presiune pe finanțele publice. 7. Justiție socială: Inechitatea de venit, sărăcia și excluziunea socială afectează o mare parte din populația României, în special în zonele rurale și în rândul comunităților marginalizate, precum romii. 8. Securitate internă și externă: România își consolidează securitatea internă și externă, în special în contextul relațiilor dificile cu vecinii săi, Rusia și Republica Moldova, și al rolului său în NATO. Aceste provocări demonstrează amploarea problemelor pe care România trebuie să le abordeze pentru a asigura o dezvoltare armonioasă și durabilă a țării.

Premise 1: \\"A young Asian man sits behind a set chessboard waiting for the other player to arrive.\\" This statement describes a specific scenario in which a young Asian man is seated behind a chessboard, presumably prepared for a match, and waiting for his opponent to join him. The context of this statement is limited to the chessboard, the young Asian man, and the impending arrival of another player. The location where this situation takes place is not explicitly mentioned. Premise 2: \\"A young man is on Mars.\\" This statement describes a different scenario wherein a young man is located on Mars, which is irrelevant to the game of chess itself. Again, the context of this statement is limited to the young man and the planet Mars. There is no mention of an Asian background or his involvement in any activities, such as playing chess. Furthermore, Mars' involvement suggests a potentially futuristic or hypothetical setting since no human has set foot on Mars yet in reality. Considering both premises, it becomes evident that there is no direct connection or relationship between them. The two statements refer to two distinct scenarios with no discernible overlapping elements that could tie them together. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to automatically assume that the young man on Mars is, in fact, the same young Asian man waiting behind the chessboard. Given the limited information provided in both premises and the lack of apparent connection between them, one cannot conclude that premise 1 is true if premise 2 is true. It is vital to establish a connecting link between the young Asian man behind the chessboard and the young man on Mars before considering whether the two statements can hold true simultaneously. Such a link could involve specifying if there is chess playing involved on Mars or further identifying the location of the chess match mentioned in the first premise. In conclusion, based on the provided information and the lack of connections between both premises, it cannot be definitively concluded whether \\"A young Asian man sits behind a set chessboard waiting for the other player to arrive\\" is true if \\"A young man is on Mars.\\" More information or context is necessary to establish a connection between the two situations and hence reach a valid conclusión."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Celebritology Live Liz Kelly: Afternoon and welcome to today's really big show. Lot's to talk about including the unfortunate (alleged) Jon Gosselin affair, Paula Abdul's sudden admission of a painkiller addiction and Lindsay Lohan... just because. Oh, and looking ahead to Saturday night's White House Correspondents Dinner. Though after the star-studded inauguration we went through only a few months back, the WHCA Dinner doesn't seem like as big of a deal this year. We'll see -- I did hear a rumor that Tom Cruise may show up and, much to Jen Chaney's delight, Jason Bateman will be in attendance. Here's a list of all the star power expected to be on hand -- so far. Let's get started... Possum Island: Dear Liz, I've been thinking lately about the whole celeb/famous person privacy/publicity balance. Specifically Elizabeth Edwards's book and Sara Jessica/Matthew B.'s surrogate thing. I mean, obviously these are public figures, and anything that happens to them is news. Mrs. Edwards's husband confessed to his affair publicly. Does it then follow that Mrs. Edwards writes a book about it? And I'm happy for SJ/MB, but now of course everyone wants to know who the surrogate is, and her family is under the microscope. After having \\"exposed\\" themselves, will they all eventually say, \\"I'm a victim of the media/paparazzi?\\" What do you think? Thanks. Liz Kelly: This is a well-thought out query. I'll do my best to make some sense here. This goes back to the whole privacy line debate we had here last week and have talked about several times over the years. There is definitely a line and, yes, certain sectors of the press can be a bit overzealous in their pursuit of private details about the lives of public figures. It sucks, but it comes with the territory. Which is why I am still somewhat amazed by people who enter into public life -- be it a politician or an actor -- and then proceed to leave themselves wide open to the vipers who are always waiting in the wings hoping for a hot scoop. At this point one has to know it comes with the territory. It may not be right, but there it is. And as absurd as some of this stuff is -- Star Magazine, ahem -- it is part of the price of having a free press and that's not something I'm willing to trade in. I think the Elizabeth Edwards book is a different issue. We're still in the privacy realm, but I'm tempted to say that the issue with Edwards is more about profiting from pain -- her own, her husbands, her childrens' and that of the supposed Edwards love child. Maureen Dowd said it better: But it's just a gratuitous peek into their lives, and one that exposes her kids, by peddling more dregs about their personal family life in a book, and exposes the ex-girlfriend who's now trying to raise the baby girl, a dead ringer for John Edwards, in South Orange, N.J. I have a lot of respect for Elizabeth Edwards and think she could have written a compelling worthwhile book without inflicting more pain. Is it a violation of privacy? Yes. But I suppose if anyone is entitled to violate it, then it is Elizabeth herself. Liz Kelly: RE: SJP's surrogate, apparently she's been unmasked as something of a wild child. And here's a link to the Maureen Dowd column referenced above. Throw your sister under the bus for Us Weekly: Who knows if Jon Gosselin is cheating or not - but that guy who who claims his sister is the mistress is as bad as the loser who ratted out Michael Phelps with the pot pics. Something tells me it is going to be a very unhappy Thanksgiving at the bro and sis house this year. Liz Kelly: That family kind of loses either way, eh? The ballad of Kiefer Sutherland: Clearly KS has issues. The intriguing/confusing aspect to the story is the weirdness coming out of Brooke Shields' camp - her reps say they don't know why Kiefer headbutted the designer, but they also claim ignorance on whether she was pushed or whatever. (If they are authorized to speak for her, you would think they would get the full story first.) washingtonpost.com: EW: Brooke Shields' rep contradicts Kiefer Sutherland Liz Kelly: Three years ago Tom Cruise almost lost his career trying to save Brooke Shields from antidepressants. Now Kiefer Sutherland is charged with assault for defending her honor and may end up back in jail. A coincidence or is Brooke Shields the unlucky tiki of the celebrity set? Andrew Morton's Angelina book: Rarely do I believe anything Star magazine says, but surely if their story is accurate Morton should have a monster libel case on his hands. The first line of the cover story from this week's issue reads, \\"Angelina Jolie is a jealous, cunning liar who cheated on Brad with a famous rock star, schemed to lure him away from Jennifer Aniston -- and even slept with her own mother's boyfriend!\\" Liz Kelly: Hot diggity! That sounds like good summer beach reading. Jon Gossel, IN: I've watched the show some. Their kids have the same age spread as mine and on a smaller level, I can relate to their trials and tribulations. So last week, I stumbled into the land of Kate Hate. It's a rough and tumble land, current capital, Detroit. But this week, the details are coming out about Jon. Wow. Who in their right mind would sign up for a reality show when their personal life is falling apart? Oh, I'm sorry, I believe Bobby Brown, Hulk Hogan, and several \\"Real Housewives\\" have already answered that question. If I were Kate, I would say, \\"Go have your affair...only you have to have it with Nadya Suleman.\\" Liz Kelly: Again, this goes back to the question of private details about public lives. And while I don't have any emotional investment in either Jon or Kate (tho the eight are pretty irresistible), I'm sorry to see their dirty laundry being aired so publicly. Two things to remember: Specific to this case: We don't know that Jon actually had an affair, although it probably wasn't the best idea for him to go clubbing with some woman who is not his wife. In general: Humans are fallible. Even humans who score TV contracts or recording deals or walk red carpets and make millions of dollars a year. Funny-ish story: I'm on the elevator and two middle-aged men get on. One guy keeps saying, \\"I think it was Renee Zellweger\\" and other is like, \\"Really, was it like 10 minutes?\\" At this point, I'm like, what are these people talking about in the elevator? Then they go quiet and when they are about to get off the elevator, one guy says, \\"I think it was Kirsten Dunst.\\" The other says, \\"No, I'm pretty sure it was Renee Zellweger.\\" \\"Wasn't it for like 5 minutes or a couple of hours?\\" \\"Nah, I think we're talking months here...\\" I finally realized they were talking about a quickie marriage. Definitely Renee, not Kirsten, yes? Liz Kelly: Oh, definitely Renee. Has anyone out there seen \\"Apaloosa?\\" A perfectly good Western utterly ruined by Renee Zellweger. Even Kirsten Dunst would have been an improvement. ishkabible: The Daily Beast, a mostly intellectual online news source, had a 3-page article about Heincer. I was devastated. It was like discovering the ants you thought were ONLY in your kitchen are now in the upstairs bed room. I thought about forwarding it to you Liz, for gems like, \\"The paparazzi are like family members to us\\" and \\"You're gonna have to pry Speidi's fame from our dead hands.\\" But THEN I read: \\"a post about me gets like 2,000 of the most evil comments. But I'm motivated by those reactions....They keep me going. It's juice. It's power. Persecute me, please.\\" Well played, you little prat. I put the matter before Liz, Producer Paul, and the collective wisdom of the Celebritology community. Would it be better to engage in the snarkfest Heincer so RICHLY deserves, or pretend we didn't notice them? The article in question: The Speidi Chronicles Liz Kelly: It's a lose-lose situation. Actually, maybe even lose-lose-lose. Kiefer, continued: What I find interesting about this whole kerfuffle is that Brooke Shields has to be substantially taller than Kiefer. I know he's Jack Bauer and all but how exactly does she need defending from a designer? Liz Kelly: Well, tall doesn't necessarily mean strong. But I would guess the difference is actually that Brooke Shields has some self control. WHCA Dinner : Jon Hamm and John Cusack?! Dear gawd...I need a ticket... Liz Kelly: Yes -- and although I'm not getting fully decked out (I'll be working, after all) my get-up is totally \\"Mad Men\\"-esque. I'm sure that'll make all the difference. College Radio: I teach at the school that hosts a radio station I've been listening to since I moved to the area. I have a total girl-crush on the station manager, the way the Fug-girls have a crush on Kelly Clarkson (\\"hey let's go have hot wings and drink beer and talk about boys!\\") But beyond our mutual employer, I have NO reason to start up a conversation or even run into her. (I teach night classes and don't really see other faculty or even go to department meetings.) So aside from walking into the station and saying \\"hey! You don't know me, but you seem like you kick ass. Wanna have lunch?\\" what is the least creepiest way I can meet this person? (I know this is sort of a Haxian question, but it's about a LOCAL celebrity, so I'm hoping you'll take it.) Liz Kelly: I'm going to open this up for suggestions... me, I'm not convinced there's a way to do this that won't seem weird. Anything I can think of just seems way too forced. I do feel your pain, though. I have totally been there. And I still think Russell Crowe and I would get along really well. Jason Bateman: Compared to his sister Justine, who started out on the very successful Family Ties series, Jason (who I first remember seeing in \\"Teen Wolf, Too\\") seems to have trod a much happier career path, playing nicely etched roles in movies like \\"Juno\\" and \\"State of Play.\\" Is he leading man material? I don't know -- not sure he takes himself that seriously. Liz Kelly: I think he's leading man material and I don't think he has to take himself seriously to move into that territory. And although \\"Arrested Development\\" was an ensemble show, it could be argued that Jason led that ensemble. I first remember him, btw, from \\"Family Ties,\\" on which he showed up from time to time as a friend of Ricky's. Along with Alfonso Ribiero (whose name I am probably butchering). Brad and Jen Meet-Up?: What do you make of this tale? Who has a movie coming out momentarily? (other than \\"Ben Button\\" on DVD) Liz Kelly: If memory serves, that particular \\"story\\" originated in Star Magazine, which -- as far as I can tell -- is written using Mad Libs books and a rotating list of celebrity names. Dork, Us: Okay, so I come out of two month Celebritology exile to find that Lilo and Jon Mayer are single again, as well as Farrah Fawcett having anal cancer, and Dom Delouise died. What other major events have I missed? Can I get a pic of Scarlet Johansson? Liz, I think I'm getting Scarletted out. We might need to retire her and solicit replacement ideas. Liz Kelly: I never thought I'd see the day when Paul tired of ScarJo. I'm curious as to who is on his kitchen list now. Bai Ling? Megan Fox? What did you miss? Hmm -- I'm assuming you know about Mel Gibson's divorce and young Russian girlfriend. Bawlmer, Hon: Thanks for the WHCD guest list! Do you know how one obtains tickets to the dinner? Was there any infighting this year over who got tickets and who didn't? And how is Ashton Kutcher going under CNN's name? Strange. Liz Kelly: News organizations buy tables and distribute the tickets as they see fit -- to people within the org and guests, who tend to be celebs and politicians. I won't actually be heading into the dinner, but instead covering the much more interesting pre-parties that basically take over every inch of the Hilton on Saturday eve. More Keifer and Brooke: If the designer Keifer assaulted was responsible for the \\"hat\\" Brooke Sheilds wore to the Kentucky Derby, then he deserved a headbutt. washingtonpost.com: No joke. She looks like something from \\"Super Mario Brothers.\\" Liz Kelly: That whole outfit is just wrong. Though I rarely see a star who can carry off a hat well. Some recent examples of stars who can: Drew Barrymore, Aretha Franklin. Usually, though, they just look like kids playing dress up. Why is that? Women used to look stunning in hats. Kal Penn: What are the chances of getting Kal to do a WashPost chat? He clearly has a huge fan base amongst the chatters, he could use it as a platform to discuss whatever the White House wants him to discuss, and a producer would be able to screen out all of the phone numbers and virtual panties. washingtonpost.com: This would depend on my competence and professionalism. So, slim. Liz Kelly: Paul is fishing for compliments. He knows he is a rock star. As for Kal, I'm guessing it wouldn't be out of the question to get him online. But, remember, the White House Web site does their own version of online chats so they may want him chatting exclusively on the administration's site. Quatch: Liz, Who is the MC for the White House Correspondents Dinner? I didn't see Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Lewis Black or any other Comedy Central people in the guest list. Did I overlook them? Liz Kelly: It's Wanda Sykes -- hometown girl made good. She used to work for the NSA, though I'm not sure what her job entailed. 15th and L: Were you there when Stephen Colbert spoke at the White House Correspondents dinner a couple years ago? I have loved him ever since. Best line of the night, \\"Now, I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32 percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don't pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in 'reality'. And reality has a well-known liberal bias.\\" washingtonpost.com: Interesting address, 15th and L. Colbert Roasts President Bush - 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner Liz Kelly: That was the one I missed, sadly. Though I watched on C-SPAN -- which is, arguably, a better experience anyhow. Jason Bateman: \\"Family Ties\\" -- of course, you meant \\"Silver Spoons.\\" Justine actually quit acting for a long time, and only recently came back to it. She had a role on \\"Desperate Housewives\\" a couple of seasons ago, and did something else recently that is escaping me at the moment... Liz Kelly: Yes, I meant \\"Silver Spoons.\\" My mind is much from staying up until the wee hours writing \\"Lost\\" analysis. Non-fans will be pleased to learn that next week is the last episode until January 2010. Washington, DC: Come on Liz! We all know know that you had a front row seat for the biggest celebrity scoop of the week. So, spill it. How was the reunion between Page and Sally? Pictures! We want pictures. Liz Kelly: There was a pic in the article. Honestly, we didn't get many. It was raining and we were trying to wrangle two dogs and cameras at the same time. Page isn't usually too friendly with other dogs, but she was okay with Sally. I think Sally was just calm enough to not set Page on edge. Sally, btw, is a total sweetheart. College Radio:: Friend her on Facebook. Add a message about how you work there too and love her show. Over time, become friendly online. Eventually you can ask her \\"out.\\" It's like online dating, only weirder. wink. Liz Kelly: That's a thought... Facebook does seem to breed an odd kind of intimacy. Jason Bateman and Alfonso Ribeiro: You meant, \\"Silver Spoons,\\" right? Now I've got that theme song in my head for the rest of the afternoon! washingtonpost.com: I'll trade you for the \\"Family Ties\\" theme. Liz Kelly: Last night Jen Chaney and I both had the \\"Macgruber\\" theme stuck in our heads. It was painful. Washington, DC: I am obsessed with Twilight and Robert Pattinson. Alas, I am no teenager -- in my forties, married with kids. Can you help me? Liz Kelly: Does it help to know you are not alone and that there are legions of 30-something and 40-something women crushing on Pattinson? Speaking of which, Weingarten claims my mini-crush on Michael Cera is wholly age inappropriate. Liz Kelly: And just so we don't give the cats short shrift, here's a short video of Andy. The sound is bad and the camera work shaky, but that hasn't stopped me from watching it three or four times already. Washington, D.C.: Can I please have a picture of Andy. The guy I've been dating just told me his feelings for me faded while I am totally in to him. Yes, I am very aware of how pathetic this request is, but my cat lives 2,500 miles away with my mom. And, I can't even claim that I'm in college. She just choose her when I moved years ago. Oh, God. I'm that girl. Andy! Please! Stat! Liz Kelly: Oh no -- I'm glad I posted that video. You need it. And I know I'm biased, but Andy's better than your loser ex anyway. Prince Harry: I read that he is going to have an official USA visit this summer. Any chance he is coming to the DC area? Liz Kelly: I can't imagine he'd come all the way across the pond without a visit to the White House, but I haven't seen any details yet. Kal Penn: Did you see the press release about the \\"Harold and Kumar\\" Christmas movie that will come out in 2010? I need details as to how that is working. In other news, my life has been a little better now that Kal Penn has started tweeting more. Liz Kelly: I actually talked about that with Kal and John Cho when I interviewed them at ComicCon last July. Apparently the company that owns the \\"Harold and Kumar\\" franchise announced plans for a new movie last summer, but hadn't yet bothered to secure either Kal or John for the film. And, according to IMDB, the project still doesn't have any talent attached. Andy, Feline Valentino?: If I were a girl cat, I would be totally crushing on Andy. That come-hither look and mysterious smile; the guy wouldn't even need to show up with a nosegay of catnip... Liz Kelly: I know. It's ridiculous. And that white patch of hair on his chest/neck totally looks like he's wearing a dress shirt or a dickie. He's just naturally debonair. Possum Island: Re: College Radio, Have you actually seen this person? Because I once had a blind date with a DJ that I had only heard on radio/talked to on the phone, and man was I disappointed (actually frightened is more like it!) Liz Kelly: Wasn't that a movie? Jason Bateman: Not Family Ties, Silver Spoons. And I had a crush on him more than Rick(y) Schroeder. Plus, he was on \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" and had a short-lived but brilliant sitcom called \\"It's Your Move.\\" I'm no longer a stalker. Liz Kelly: Just to make sure -- I did clarify that I meant \\"Silver Spoons,\\" yes? Page and Sally!: I had a similar experience with my family's dog, Jeter. I volunteer with a rescue in the are, and my parents brought him to visit, socialize and get microchipped. While we were there, another couple walks up with their dog. Zeno was the spitting image of Jeter, just lankier and 15lbs lighter. In more celebritological news, any good locales for celeb-watching this weekend? washingtonpost.com: When you play ball with Jeter, does he have to play extra deep because he's lost a step and can no longer make routine plays? Liz Kelly: A sports joke. In my chat. I'm going to cry. As for celeb watching, the Hilton is the prime spot. Usually there is a roped off fan area set up along the red carpet. But judging from years past, it is loaded with teenaged girls. So, be warned. Weingarten claims my mini-crush on Michael Cera is wholly age inappropriate. : He's 26! You're fine! Liz Kelly: Ehrm, no. He's 20. No man, No Cat, D.C.: Thank you. That was enough. I can finish my work today. Liz Kelly: Well, at least wait until 2 p.m. to get started. Bernie Madoff: The Movie: I'm thinking an old-time SNL reunion feature. Jon Lovitz as Madoff, Jane Curtin as the wife, and Nora Dunn as the newly surfaced tell-all assistant. (Lovitz already played the villain in the sendup of \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" so he has the role down pat.) washingtonpost.com: Wow, I had forgotten this was the episode Shatner hosted! Liz Kelly: I love that clip -- we showed that one last December in Weingarten's chat, too. It never gets old. Houston: Thanks for letting us bend your ear -as an alum of a Kentucky university, I have to set the record straight on the Brooke Shields hat thing - the traditional thing for high society women to do at the Kentucky Derby is to wear an ornate, over the top, hat. And the Derby is about nothing, if not tradition. Sort of like at some churches, ladies wear really elaborate headgear. So, as for the hat, Brooke was just doing in Rome what the Romans do. Liz Kelly: But \\"ornate, over the top\\" does not necessarily have to mean \\"ugly,\\" does it? Query: Can we qualify any future Lindsay Lohan work as \\"having no talent attached\\"? Justine actually quit acting for a long time: She was battling anorexia. Liz Kelly: That must have been after \\"Satisfaction,\\" in which she played the leader of an all girl beach band who was romancing a music producer played by Liam Neeson. Brooke Shields: And Andre Agassi didn't start winning again until after they split! Liz Kelly: The plot thickens. Bai Ling? Megan Fox? : No and No. I vote for Rachel Bilson. Mena from \\"That 70s Show.\\" washingtonpost.com: I think you mean Mila Kunis from \\"That '70s Show\\"? Or do you mean Mila in addition to Rachel? I'm confused. I'm leaning toward Robin Scherbatsky. legions of 30-something and 40-something women crushing on Pattinson? : You think that's bad? I know a married mother in her 50s who belongs to an online fan club for adult fans of Hanson. Owe the humanity! washingtonpost.com: I don't know if that's at typo or pun. Liz Kelly: It's a pun, Paul. A longtime entry in the Official Celebritology Glossary. Can I just say that I came into the building today to work because I have a few meetings. I went to the trouble of reserving a conference room so I could have my accustomed solitude while chatting. Too bad there's some kind of morale building sales meeting in the next conference room over. I think there may be role-playing and team building happening. It sounds like Grand Central Station. re: Pattinson: I, too, am struggling with an age inappropriate crush on Pattinson. Read some of the interviews he's done where he admits his total paranoia about being overwhelmed by fans or getting stabbed by someone in a crowd. GQ's interview was great. He seems to be someone who truly regrets becoming famous. Admittedly, I still have a crush on him, but now I feel BAD about it. (And you are right on about Cera. Tell Gene to shut his mouth.) washingtonpost.com: GQ: HE'S HOT, HE'S SEXY, HE'S UNDEAD Liz Kelly: Thank you and thank you. Olney, MD: FYI: Justine Bateman was last seen in several episodes of \\"Men in Trees\\" at the end of its first season which became the shows second season because of the writers strike. ABC canceled the series last season. Liz Kelly: Thank you -- and Producer Paul reminds me that Julia Roberts was also in \\"Satisfaction.\\" Brooke Shields: You know, if Brooke had added a couple more inches to her Derby outfit, no one would be taking about it. It looks like it's 2 sizes too small - not that she doesn't fit in it, but that the waist is too high, the v neck too low and the hemline too high. Liz Kelly: Dress too small, hat too big. Boston: Just want to say that \\"Ick. Nast\\" is my new quote of the summer. Stay classy, Jon's alleged's mistresses' brother! (My other quote is \\"Stay out of it Nick Lachey!\\" thanks to the Soup. Do you watch it? I love it). Liz Kelly: Yes. I watch and love. And \\"Stay out of it, Nick Lachey\\" was classic. Ner,DO: Just throwing this out there, but Justine Batement played a hooker on Arrested Development who tried to pickup Jason Bateman's character and ended up being his sister. The episode was titled Family Ties. I think it was one of the last episodes of the show. And yes, I'm already in line for the opening of the movie. Liz Kelly: That must have been in the third season -- which Mr. Liz and I started watching, but soon stopped after we realized there had been a serious decline in quality. Does it get better again? Replacement: Easy: Minka Kelley - shes going to be in DC for a while now too! washingtonpost.com: I'm not even sure she's the best looking woman on \\"Friday Night Lights.\\" I'll take Mrs. Coach. New Crush for Producer Paul: Miss California washingtonpost.com: She is what an ex-roommate of mine referred to as \\"Dirty Hot.\\" Liz Kelly: What is this, Maxim online? Falls Church, Va.: I'm sorry but I just don't get the appeal of Jennifer Garner. She's not very pretty (the angular face, puffy lips, stick out ears.....maybe pretty for an average woman but not a movie star). And then starring in awful AWFUL movies like \\"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\\"...tell me, what's her appeal? Is she the luckiest woman on Earth to be so famous or what? washingtonpost.com: For guys, I posit it begins with the post 2006 Super Bowl episode of \\"Alias\\" where she beat up a plane full of bad guys in her underwear. She was the one in her underwear, to clarify. Liz Kelly: I think she's attractive. She's not classically beautiful, but she's got an interesting angular face and she's in fab shape. Much like Hillary Swank. And don't forget that in addition to \\"dirty hot,\\" there's also what we dubbed \\"ugly pretty\\" a couple of years back. People who are somehow not all that attractive, but you crush on them for some unknown reason. Vincent Gallo is one of these for me. Julia Roberts: So last night I was watching Green Day do American Idiot for VH1 Storytellers or whatever it's called, and at the end, there was a DMB video for a song called \\"Dreamgirl\\" and Julia Roberts was in it. (I may be wholly behind the times here, but I rarely watch \\"music\\" tv.) I just thought that was kind of weird, and doesn't she have better things to do? Also, ever since I saw Dave Matthews play a gifted but retarded man on \\"House\\" I can't help but think of him in that role at all times. Liz Kelly: That song and vid are a few years old, right? Just Curious: Why was the item about the passing of Stanley Tucci's wife in the \\"Rumor Mill\\" section of today's column? Seems he confirmed it to the NY Post. Liz Kelly: The version I saw was not confirmed. And the only other place I could find the story was Contact Music, which was a direct pull of the NY Post blurb. Maybe they've since updated? Question for the ages: Liz, which one of your chats do you love the most? (almost as bad as asking which pet you love the most) Liz Kelly: I love all of my chats equally, though for different reasons. Wanda Sykes for the White House Correspondants: Isn't that a little too obvious? Black president so we have to get a black comedian to MC? Having said that, she is hilarious. Liz Kelly: I think you're reading a little too much into this. Carm down. Liz Kelly: Okay -- apologies, but I need to run to the loo before I switch gears for the \\"Lost\\" chat.

Q: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What increases blood flow to the body's surface?\\" is \\"Blood vessels widen\\"?","output":"Yes, that's right!

Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats.

Competitors on May The Best House Win – the popular Channel 4 programme in which four houseproud people judge one another’s homes – generally abide by an unwritten rule. It states that when the show is over, all agree it was a fair contest and the winners deserve the £1,000 prize. But nothing would persuade Robert and Lisa Foden, from near Warrington in Cheshire, to agree. Lisa, 34, who appeared on the show on May 20 last year, says they lost only because ‘the two people who won gave everyone else rubbish marks’. This may sound like sour grapes, but given the effort and ingenuity that went into the couple’s extraordinary Bond-themed home, filled with high-tech luxuries 007 would be proud of, their angst is understandable.","output":"For months after the show's airing, the Foden couple could not shake the feeling of being unfairly judged by their fellow competitors. Their sleek, modern, and tech-savvy home, designed around the iconic James Bond theme, was certainly a cut above the rest. However, they couldn't shake the nagging feeling that there was more to the judging than met the eye. For weeks, the Fodens analyzed the episodes that preceded theirs and found a pattern. In each episode, a specific couple would give extremely low scores to their competitors, resulting in the couple becoming the show's victors. These findings fueled Lisa and Robert's search for the truth. They decided that the only way to clear their conscience and expose the accused couple's alleged tactics was to show their proof to the show's producers. Gathering their evidence in the form of a detailed table and chart, Lisa and Robert brought their concerns to the attention of the producers via a formal letter. In the letter, they laid out the patterns they discovered and explained that the alleged manipulative ratings were the reason their own home did not win the prize. The couple also politely requested a revision of their episode's scores to ensure a fairer outcome. Following the Fodens' revelations, the Channel 4 producers decided to investigate the matter further, comparing the scores over other episodes where the accused couple resided. Although there was hesitation in making a final decision due to the subjective nature of judging homes, the compelling evidence provided by the Fodens led to the show's producers taking swift action. To make amends for the alleged foul play, the May The Best House Win production team decided to combine the scores of the Foden's house against a different set of episodes, resulting in a more fair comparison. After a complete reassessment of the scores, the Fodens' Bond-themed home was declared the new grand winner of the show, and they were finally awarded the sought-after £1,000 prize. The Channel 4 team reached out to the Foden couple, who expressed their gratitude for the fairer outcome. The show's producers ensured that future episodes would be closely monitored to prevent manipulative scoring tactics from affecting the overall results. The couple featured in the original winning episode was barred from participating in future shows, and their victory was stripped from the record. In the weeks that followed, the story unfolded in the media, gaining widespread public attention. The show saw a surge in viewership as the audiences became curious about the result of the Fodens' tireless pursuit of fairness. Out of controversy came growth, and Channel 4 vowed to enhance their show's integrity and maintain the original lighthearted spirit of friendly competition. For the Fodens, their efforts did more than just secure victory. Their dedication to fairness transformed a potentially negative experience into a lesson in perseverance and advocating for justice in a seemingly innocent TV show. Ultimately, their actions reshaped the rules of May The Best House Win and served as an important reminder to always stand up for what is right, even when it comes to the less critical, but equally as meaningful aspects of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Barrow was born in Springfield, Illinois, the oldest of four children, all male, born to Effie Ann Vinson-Heller and John Barrow. Barrow's father fought in the Ohio Volunteer Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, Barrow's parents, with John's mother, brothers, and sisters, traveled in a covered wagon to Nebraska; Barrow was born on a hemp plantation belonging to relatives during the trip. The Barrows lived in Nebraska for six years before moving to Des Moines, Iowa. Barrow partnered with Harry Stevens in 1894 to sell concessions at baseball games. He helped George Moreland form the Interstate League, a Class-C minor league, in 1894. Barrow, with Stevens and Al Buckenberger, purchased the Wheeling Nailers of the Interstate League in 1896. Barrow served as field manager until the collapse of the league that season. The team continued in the Iron and Oil League for the rest of the year.  Barrow then bought the Paterson Silk Weavers of the Class-A Atlantic League, managing them for the rest of the 1896 season. Barrow discovered Honus Wagner throwing lumps of coal at a railroad station in Pennsylvania, and signed him to his first professional contract. Barrow sold Wagner to the Louisville Colonels of the National League (NL) for 2,100 the next year (61,774 in current dollar terms). With poor attendance, Barrow brought in professional boxers as a draw: he had James J. Corbett play first base while John L. Sullivan and James J. Jeffries umpired. He also hired Lizzie Arlington, the first woman in professional baseball, to pitch a few innings a game.  From 1897 through 1899, Barrow served as president of the Atlantic League. During this time, in the winter of 1898-99, Barrow and Jake Wells established a movie theater in Richmond, Virginia. Barrow managed Paterson again in 1899, but the league folded after the season.  With the money earned from the sale of the Richmond movie theater, Barrow purchased a one-quarter share of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class-A Eastern League in 1900 from Arthur Irwin, and served as the team's manager. Irwin, hired to be the manager of the Washington Senators of the NL, brought his most talented players with him. Rebuilding the Maple Leafs, Barrow acquired talented players, such as Nick Altrock, and the team improved from a fifth-place finish in 1899, to a third-place finish in 1900, and a second-place finish in 1901. The Maple Leafs won the league championship in 1902, even though they lost many of their most talented players, including Altrock, to the upstart American League (AL).  Barrow managed in the major leagues with the Detroit Tigers of the AL in 1903, finishing fifth, a thirteen-game improvement from their 1902 finish. With the Tigers, Barrow feuded with shortstop Kid Elberfeld. Tigers' owner Sam Angus sold the team to William Yawkey before the 1904 season. Barrow managed the Tigers again in 1904, but unable to coexist with Frank Navin, Yawkey's secretary-treasurer, Barrow tendered his resignation. He then managed the Montreal Royals of the Eastern League for the rest of the season. He managed the Indianapolis Indians of the Class-A American Association in 1905 and Toronto in 1906. Disheartened with baseball after finishing in last place, Barrow hired Joe Kelley to manage Toronto in 1907, and after signing the rest of the team's players, became manager of the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto. Did he change teams?","output":"Yes, Ed Barrow changed teams multiple times throughout his career in baseball. In his early years, he moved from managing the Wheeling Nailers in the Interstate League to managing the Paterson Silk Weavers in the Class-A Atlantic League. After serving as the president of the Atlantic League from 1897 to 1899, he became the manager and part-owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Class-A Eastern League in 1900. Barrow then went on to manage the Detroit Tigers in the major leagues, serving as their manager in 1903 and 1904. After resigning from the Tigers, he managed the Montreal Royals of the Eastern League for the rest of the 1904 season and then went on to manage the Indianapolis Indians in the Class-A American Association in 1905. He returned to manage the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1906 before eventually hiring Joe Kelley to take over as manager in 1907. A quote from the article that talks about his move from managing the Detroit Tigers to the Montreal Royals is: \\"Barrow managed the Tigers again in 1904, but unable to coexist with Frank Navin, Yawkey's secretary-treasurer, Barrow tendered his resignation.

Continue the following story. The oil spilled on Nick 's shirt while he cooked for Justin, so","output":"he quickly opted to change his clothes before the stubborn stain had a chance to set. But the sight of the spreading oil stain reminded Nick of a childhood memory when his mom was preparing fried chicken for dinner. A similar mishap had happened, and she had soaked the shirt in vinegar and hand-washed the grease out. Although the evening recently took an expected turn, Nick felt a wave of nostalgia wash over him, grateful that he had the opportunity to revisit the past briefly. Unwilling to let the oil stain ruin his pleasant memory, Nick dashed to his room to find a clean shirt. Knowing the stain would be harder to remove the longer it lingered, he also grabbed a small bowl and filled it with vinegar. After soaking the shirt in the solution, he set it aside and changed into a fresh one.  As the comforting smell of dinner wafted through the air, Nick turned his attention back to the task at hand: preparing a meal for his old friend, Justin. The two were inseparable growing up, and their lives intertwined on so many levels. They knew each other's likes and dislikes, which made cooking dishes that suited both of their tastes a breeze. This time, Nick opted for a mouthwatering Italian feast consisting of creamy mushroom fettuccine Alfredo topped with grilled chicken, served with delicious garlic ciabatta, and a summer tomato-arugula salad on the side. The preparation required a bit more focus and diligence than he anticipated, noting that his pan was still sizzling from the earlier oil spill. A sigh escaped his lips as he wiped the pan clean and started over, ensuring that the oil was at the right temperature this time. However, despite the minor setback, Nick carried on, fueled by the happy memories of cooking together with his friend Justin. Recounting their youthful culinary adventures and the satisfaction of sharing a homemade meal, he focused on the warmth that the memory stirred within him. It gave him the motivation he needed to finish the dinner preparations. Meanwhile, Justin was on his way to Nick's apartment and couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. Reuniting with his oldest friend made him reflect on their journey as friends and the valuable time they spent growing side by side. Both of them had come a long way, each pursuing different careers and settling in various parts of the world. But their bond remained strong, and they always managed to pick up where they left off. Upon seeing each other, the two old friends embraced warmly—a hug filled with memories and unspoken words. They exchanged stories and caught up on each other's lives, reminiscing about the times they shared while growing up. Over the delightful Italian feast, Nick and Justin rediscovered their incredible connection, spoke about their individual accomplishments, and shared heartaches, dreams, and future plans. As the evening wound down to a close, they found comfort in the knowledge that, despite the passage of time, the bond between them remained unbroken. Despite the various turns and bends their individual lives had taken, the memory of sharing time together in the kitchen solidified the roots of their friendship. Settling down on the couch in Nick's cozy apartment, they returned to their respective roles—as if no time had passed—laughing and pondering life's joys and challenges together, deep into the night."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Researchers have uncovered animal bones, flint tools, and evidence of burning that predates the first stones at Stonehenge by nearly 5,000 years. Here, an animal bone, with a point still in it      Editor's Note: This story was updated April 24 at 10:20 a.m. ET.      A site near Stonehenge has revealed archaeological evidence that hunters lived just a mile from Stonehenge roughly 5,000 years prior to the construction of the first stones, new research suggests.      What's more, the site, which was occupied continuously for 3,000 years, had evidence of burning, thousands of flint tool fragments and bones of wild aurochs , a type of extinct giant cow. That suggests the area near Stonehenge may have been an auroch migration route that became an ancient feasting site, drawing people together from across different cultures in the region, wrote lead researcher David Jacques of the Open University in the United Kingdom, in an email.      \\"We may have found the cradle of Stonehenge, the reason why it is where it is,\\" Jacques wrote. [In Photos: A Walk Through Stonehenge]      The new discovery may also identify the people who first erected structures at Stonehenge. A few gigantic pine posts, possibly totem poles, were raised at Stonehenge between 8,500 and 10,000 years ago, but until now there was scant evidence of occupation in the area that long ago. The new research suggests those ancient structures may perhaps have been raised to honor a sacred hunting ground.      Mysterious monument      For decades, people have wondered at the enigmatic stone structures erected roughly 5,000 years ago in the plains of Wiltshire, England. No one knows why ancient people built the structure: some believe it was a place of ancient worship or a sun calendar, whereas still others think it was a symbol of unity or even that Stonehenge was inspired by a sound illusion.      The large megaliths, known as sarsens, are up to 30 feet tall and weigh up to 25 tons, while the smaller bluestones weigh up to 4 tons. Researchers think the giant boulders came from a quarry near Marlborough Downs, just 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the iconic site, while the bluestones likely came from Preseli Hills in Wales, nearly 156 miles (250 km) away from Stonehenge.      Old photographs      Jacques was looking through archival photographs of the region surrounding Stonehenge when he spotted a site known as Vespasian's Camp, just a mile from Stonehenge in nearby Amesbury.      Realizing that it hadn't been fully surveyed, Jacques began to investigate the area, which harbored a freshwater spring.      Because animals like to stop and drink at such watering holes, Jacques wondered whether ancient man may have settled nearby as well.      The team uncovered roughly 350 animal bones and 12,500 flint tools or fragments, as well as lots of evidence of burning. Carbon dating suggested the area was occupied by humans from 7500 B.C. to 4700 B.C. — roughly 5,000 years prior to the erection of the first stones at Stonehenge. [See Photos of the Stonehenge Hunting Ground ]      \\"The spring may have originally attracted large animals to it, which would have aided hunting and may have led to associations that the area was a sacred hunting ground,\\" Jacques wrote.      In addition, the researchers found tools made from stone from one region of England, but fashioned in the style of another region (for instance, a stone tool made from Welsh or Cornwall slate, but made in a style typical of Sussex). That suggests the people from different regions were coming together at the site, Jacques wrote.      Ancient builders?      The findings could help researchers pinpoint why the ancient builders of Stonehenge chose the place they did, Jacques said.      \\"We have found a bridge from which transmission of cultural memory about the 'specialness' of the place where the stones were later being put up was possible,\\" Jacques wrote. \\"We are getting closer to understanding their reasons for putting it up — it is all to do with ancestors, but those ancestors go much further back than has previously been realised.\\"      The findings show \\"there was a substantial interest in the Stonehenge landscape well before the stones were hauled there and erected,\\" said Timothy Darvill, an archaeologist at Bournemouth University in the U.K., who was not involved in the study.      Excavations dating to 2008 at Stonehenge also confirm earlier use at the megalithic site, Darvill wrote. However, what makes the Amesbury discovery special is the large trove of auroch bones found in the area, which suggests the spring was on a natural migration route for the wild aurochs, he said.      A program about the Amesbury site will air on BBC 4 on April 29.      Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter @tiaghose. Follow LiveScience @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

The teachers tried to fit all the books into the schools but the","output":"volumes were simply too numerous and space in the schools too limited. The effort was admirable, yet it appeared herculean given the sheer quantity of books that were to be integrated. The number of books was staggering, encompassing several thousands, each carrying immense educational value and potential to positively impact the students. These books were acquired from various sources including donations from non-profit organizations and individuals who wished to enrich the libraries of these institutions. Teaching aids, textbooks, fiction, non-fiction, research journals, periodicals, encyclopedias, atlases – the spectrum of book categories was diverse. They included seminal works of literature, science, history, and arts that had the potential to shape and inspire the young minds in the institutions. They possessed enormous potential to contribute not just to the academic understanding of the students but also to their overall personality development, by broadening their perspectives on varied subjects and encouraging them to think creatively and critically. The teachers, fully aware of their usefulness and the importance of these learning resources, were determined to incorporate them into the school system. They toiled tirelessly, sorting and categorizing the books, arranging them methodically in an attempt to fit them into the limited space. They even tried creative spacing solutions - making use of the walls for hanging bookshelves, attempting to crowd the library spaces more efficiently, even looking to find space under stairwells and unused corners.  However, the space the schools provided was highly limited. Education facilities, especially those in busy urban environments or underserved rural areas, often suffer from space constraints. Classrooms were already packed with students, leaving little extra space for new bookshelves. Existing libraries, despite their best efforts to maximize storage solutions, struggled to accommodate the influx of these new books. Furthermore, increasing the capacity to store books in the school comes with logistical issues. The overcrowded spaces could lead to issues related to the maintenance and preservation of the books. Increasing the books to an insurmountable quantity might hamper the students' accessibility to these resources, as locating a particular book in a sea of texts would become increasingly difficult. What this situation underscores is a larger issue faced by numerous educational institutions - the desirability for more resources yet the struggle to accommodate them. The teachers' efforts become emblematic of a universal endeavor in education to provide more for students, yet the limitations of physical infrastructure can sometimes prove to be challenging. As such, the teachers’ dilemma of trying to fit all the books into the schools highlights the necessity for scaling up infrastructure, for improved storage solutions, and potentially for exploring digital alternatives, to ensure that valuable resources such as these books can be incorporated and utilized effectively in the learning process."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Everybody at the picnic thought breastfeeding publicly is a good idea","output":"Based on the provided information, it can be inferred that people at the outdoor luncheon in Cambridge, MA, were comfortable with and accepting of public breastfeeding. While the scenario suggests that nobody minded the public breastfeeding, there may be various opinions that individuals held but did not express. It is important to consider several factors before concluding that everyone at the event thought public breastfeeding is a good idea: 1. Cultural context: The acceptance of public breastfeeding could be linked to the cultural attitudes in the area, as Cambridge, MA, is generally recognized as a progressive and open-minded community. This context, however, does not guarantee that every individual present held the same positive perspective on public breastfeeding. 2. Individual beliefs: People often have different beliefs and values based on their upbringing, personal experiences, religious or cultural backgrounds, or education. Thus, it is possible that some individuals may have had reservations or concerns about public breastfeeding, but chose not to express their opinions in order not to offend the mother or disrupt the event. 3. Social pressure: In some cases, individuals may choose to conform to the collective opinion or behavior within a social situation due to the desire to fit in, avoid conflict, or adhere to societal norms. It could be that some people at the event did not agree with public breastfeeding, but felt uncomfortable or unwilling to speak out and draw attention to their differing opinion. 4. Tolerance vs. endorsement: It is crucial to differentiate between tolerating a behavior and actively endorsing it. While the attendees did not object to the public breastfeeding, it does not necessarily mean they all considered it a good idea. Some people may have personal reservations about the practice but were respectful of the mother's choice and did not want to interfere. Taking all these factors into account, it would be more accurate to assert that the attendees at the outdoor luncheon were respectful and tolerant of public breastfeeding, rather than making a generalization that everyone thought it was a good idea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: EXETER — About 300 people jammed St. Cecelia’s Church Monday to say goodbye to their friend and loved one, Kevin McGroarty.      But most of those in attendance expected McGroarty to show up.      Kevin McGroarty died Tuesday and his cremated remains were interred Monday afternoon at, as he called it in his self-written obituary, his new home at Mt. Olivet Cemetery.      His cousin, Bill McGroarty, offered what Kevin might have thought about the packed church at his funeral.      “He would ask, ‘Don’t all these people have something better to do today?’” Bill said.      Monday’s service was filled with emotion — genuine grief and sadness over losing “everybody’s best friend.” There was humor, as you would expect, but the overall tone was a group-shared sense of extreme loss.      But it was McGroarty’s obituary, written by him a year ago, according to his closest friends, that jettisoned McGroarty to his 15 minutes of fame following his death.      For example, McGroarty wrote:      “McGroarty Achieves Room Temperature!      “Kevin J. McGroarty, 53, of West Pittston, died Tuesday, July 22, 2014, after battling a long fight with mediocracy.      “He enjoyed elaborate practical jokes, over-tipping in restaurants, sushi and Marx Brothers movies.”      Just a sampling of the wit and humor of McGroarty, who was a self-described “veteran of the advertising industry.”      Big man, bigger heart      Tim Yurek was charged with delivering the eulogy at Monday’s service. As Yurek struggled with emotion, fighting back tears, he managed to paint a clear picture of the man most in attendance knew, but many — especially those who read his obituary — wished they had known.      The Rev. Paul McDonnell, a longtime friend of McGroarty’s, conducted the service and he, too, offered touching remarks about a man who literally and figuratively was larger than life. McDonnell described McGroarty as a “big man with a big heart.”      “He brought so much joy into our lives,” he said. “His obituary has become the talk of the town — well, the talk of the country actually.”      McDonnell said some are probably wondering if McGroarty really did die.      “Could he have faked his death?” McDonnell asked. “We gathered here today know that, unfortunately, is not true.”      McDonnell said McGroarty was a man of faith who flew in the face of an angry world.      “Kevin reminds us of what life is truly about,” he said. “Kevin made us laugh. He wanted us to love one another. I read in the newspaper that somebody rated this area as the unhappiest. Whoever said that never met Kevin McGroarty. The best way to remember Kevin is to imitate his life. Be good to each other every day.”      Yurek stepped to the podium and took a deep breath. He said his goal was to honor McGroarty’s life.      “He was George Bailey from ‘It’s a Wonderful Life,’” Yurek said. “He didn’t have a lot of money, but he was the richest guy in town.”      Yurek said McGroarty was an adoring son and a loving brother who had impeccable penmanship.      “And he was an incredible friend,” Yurek said. “Kevin was the person you called when you needed someone to talk to — a shoulder to cry on, to share successes with. He was a good listener.”      A cell phone went off in church and Yurek said, “Get that, it’s probably Kevin.” Yurek said you could trust McGroarty with a secret or a million dollars. He admitted his faults and was well-aware of his blessings.      But Yurek said, McGroarty was a boy from Wyoming — the town he grew up in and loved.      “He cherished his roots,” Yurek said. “His passing leaves a huge hole.”      In 2012, with the talk of the end of the world soon to come, Yurek said McGroarty posted this on Facebook:      “No matter how it comes, it’s been a great ride. I’ve enjoyed every minute of it. Adios to those I love; you know who you are.”      With that, Yurek ended his eulogy with, “Adios, Kevin.”      As McGroarty’s urn was taken from the church, with his family and friends following, “When Irish Eyes Were Smiling” played in the background.      Later in the day, three of his closest friends — Sam Rizzo, Dave Fusco and Jim Dellarte — fought back tears at Pat Patte’s Sports Bar and they talked about their late friend and his zest for life.      “There are a lot of life lessons to be learned from the way Kevin led his life,” Rizzo, 53, said.      Noting good deeds      The three talked about McGroarty and his almost uncontrollable penchant for helping/rewarding those less fortunate and those who performed random acts of kindness, like the time in Las Vegas when a vagrant approached Rizzo and McGroarty and others asking for a couple of bucks.      Nobody responded, except McGroarty.      “He handed the guy a fifty dollar bill,” Rizzo said. “And he asked the vagrant to promise him that he would have at least a sandwich and not spend it all on booze.”      Rizzo asked McGroarty why he did that and his response was, “Someday that might be me.”      And then at Grotto Harveys Lake, a group came in after an afternoon of boating. They had their valuables in a bag that they set on the floor. When they were leaving, they forgot the bag and two young women grabbed it and ran after the people to return it.      “Kevin asked the waitress for their bill and he paid it,” Dellarte said. ” The waitress asked who shall I say paid the bill and Kevin told her it didn’t matter; that they didn’t know each other. The waitress asked why he would pay their bill and Kevin just said that he saw them do a nice deed for someone.”      Fusco said his daughter broke her ankle and was in the hospital for surgery. When Kevin found out, he would send her flowers, candy, gifts every day.      “That was Kevin,” he said. “That’s where his heart was.”      Earlier in the day, the three friends greeted all of the visitors at church. They were amazed at the number of people who they didn’t know, but who knew Kevin. And there were several people who only knew him from his obituary.      “One man told me he never met Kevin, but he read his obituary and he wanted to come and see what he was all about.”      Fusco visited McGroarty on the night before he died. It was 9:30 p.m.      “He told me he didn’t receive guests after 9 p.m.,” Fusco said. “Now get out of here, he told me.”      Fusco, Rizzo and Dellarte laughed — and cried. They said they already miss their friend.      And, they said, they always will. ||||| Leave it to an ad guy to write his own hilariously entertaining obituary, and have it go viral in the days after his death.      Kevin J. McGroarty, who died last Tuesday at age 53, had worked in advertising since 1983 and ran Rhino Media in West Pittston, Pa., until 2006, according to the obituary in the Wilkes Barre Times Leader—a 500-word mini masterpiece that gets off to a flying start with the line: \\"McGroarty achieves room temperature!\\"      Every paragraph is amusing, though the high points include:      • He was preceded in death by brother, Airborne Ranger Lt. Michael F. McGroarty, and many beloved pets, Chainsaw, an English Mastiff in Spring 2009, Baron, an Irish Setter in August 1982, Peter Max, a turtle, Summer 1968; along with numerous house flies and bees, but they were only acquaintances.      • McGroarty leaves behind no children (that he knows of), but if he did their names would be son, \\"Almighty Thor\\" McGroarty; and daughter, \\"Butter Cup Patchouli.\\"      • He would like to remind his friends: \\"Please, don't email me, I'm dead.\\"      • A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10 a.m. Monday in St. Cecilia Church of St. Barbara Parish, 1700 Wyoming Ave., Exeter, following a brief rant of how the government screwed up all of the Bugs Bunny cartoons trying to censor violence.      God bless him. Read the full obituary below.            Obituary: Kevin J. McGroarty      WEST PITTSTON, Pa.—McGroarty Achieves Room Temperature!      Kevin J. McGroarty, 53, of West Pittston, died Tuesday, July 22, 2014, after battling a long fight with mediocracy.      Born 1960 in the Nesbitt Hospital, he was the bouncing baby boy of the late Lt. Col. Edward M. McGroarty and Helen Jane (Hudson) McGroarty, whom the New York Times should have noted as extraordinary parents.      He was baptized at St. Cecilia Church, Exeter, which later burned to the ground, attended Butler Street Elementary, which was later torn down, and middle school at 6th Street in Wyoming, now an apartment building.      He enjoyed elaborate practical jokes, over-tipping in restaurants, sushi and Marx Brother's movies. He led a crusade to promote area midget wrestling, and in his youth was noted for his many unsanctioned daredevil stunts.      He was preceded in death by brother, Airborne Ranger Lt. Michael F. McGroarty, and many beloved pets, Chainsaw, an English Mastiff in Spring 2009, Baron, an Irish Setter in August 1982, Peter Max, a turtle, Summer 1968; along with numerous house flies and bees, but they were only acquaintances.      McGroarty leaves behind no children (that he knows of), but if he did their names would be son, \\"Almighty Thor\\" McGroarty; and daughter, \\"Butter Cup Patchouli.\\"      McGroarty was a veteran of the advertising industry since 1983. McGroarty was a pioneer in Apple computing, purchasing one of the first in the Wyoming Valley in 1985. He would like to remind his friends: \\"Please, don't email me, I'm dead.\\"      McGroarty was a founding partner of Pyramid Advertising, and finally principal owner of award-winning Rhino Media until 2006. He was also an adjunct instructor at Luzerne County Community College, from 2005-2009.      He will be laid to rest at Mount Olivet Cemetery, section 7N. He asks to please make note of his new address. McGroarty's headstone reads: \\"I'll Be Right Back,\\" one of his favorite sayings. He leaves this world with few regrets, one being told in grade school, his adult life would see the Hershey candy bar rise in cost to over a dollar. He maintained given the resources and initiative, he would rally the good citizens of the Commonwealth to a revolution that would force that price to its original 35-cent market value, a dream he was not able to fulfill, by his own admission the reason: \\"I was distracted by many beautiful women.\\"      In lieu of flowers, friends are asked to please give generously to the Pennsylvania State Police Troop \\"P\\" Camp Cadet Fund.      A Mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10 a.m. Monday in St. Cecilia Church of St. Barbara Parish, 1700 Wyoming Ave., Exeter, following a brief rant of how the government screwed up all of the Bugs Bunny cartoons trying to censor violence. This will be presented by his attorney, Bret Zankel, Esq. Friends may call from 9 to 10 a.m. Monday in the church.      McGroarty leaves behind a thought for all to ponder, given years of gathering wisdom from different religions and deep study of the Greek philosophers: \\"It costs nothing to be nice\\" and \\"Never stick a steak knife in an electrical outlet.\\"      Arrangements by the Metcalfe-Shaver-Kopcza Funeral Home Inc., 504 Wyoming Ave., Wyoming.       |||||Summary:","output":"Kevin McGroarty's funeral took place at St. Cecelia's Church, where 300 people came to say their goodbyes.

Eulogist Tim Yurek managed to paint a clear picture of the man that many admired and wished they had known.

From listing unusual names he might have given his hypothetical children to sarcastically requesting not to be emailed because he's dead, Kevin McGroarty's obituary captivated the hearts of readers across the country. He even included amusing lines in the details for his Mass of Christian Burial, asking mourners to attend a brief rant about how the government ruined Bugs Bunny cartoons through censorship. His final piece of advice in the obituary? \\"It costs nothing to be nice\\" and \\"Never stick a steak knife in an electrical outlet.\\" His ability to entertain both in life and after death leaves a long-lasting legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alternatively, you could focus on one type of wine, such as all merlot or chardonnay. Another option is picking wines that pair perfectly with a certain food (such as chocolate or cheese). Step 1: Decide the specific focus of the wine tasting Since a theme has been suggested to create cohesiveness, focusing on one type of wine or wine-food pairings will help narrow down the selections while keeping guests engaged in the unique offerings. Step 2: Research appropriate decorations and table settings Based on the chosen focus, research suitable decorations, such as tablecloths, napkins, plates, and glassware that match the theme. For example, if focusing on wine and cheese pairings, invest in attractive cheese boards and proper utensils. Step 3: Set up the tasting stations Arrange the wine selections and appropriate food pairings in an attractive and organized manner, ensuring that there is adequate space for all guests to comfortably taste and discuss the offerings. Step 4: Provide information on the wines Since many guests may be unfamiliar with the wines or their ideal pairings, prepare and display descriptions for each wine, including the region, variety, flavor profile, and any relevant pairing suggestions. Step 5: Enhance the atmosphere with music and lighting In addition to the decorations and theme, creating an inviting atmosphere is essential for a successful wine tasting party. Select music that aligns with the mood, such as soft jazz or classical, and adjust the lighting to create a cozy ambiance. Step 6: Encourage guests to discuss their tasting experiences As the party progresses, provide opportunities for guests to share their thoughts and impressions on the wines and pairings, creating an engaging and interactive experience for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After getting into an elevator to go to her hotel room, she meets Spencer Aimes (Ashton Kutcher). Spencer asks her out for drinks, and she accepts. The scene then changes to Spencer sneaking onto a boat, putting a remote controlled bomb on the bottom of a helicopter, then taking out a guard. He then swims back and goes on the date with Jen. After the helicopter takes off, Spencer triggers the bomb using his phone. After a night of drinking, Jen reveals that she's not the spontaneous person she's been pretending to be and, in return, Spencer bluntly tells her that he's an assassin, albeit unhappy about being one. Unfortunately, she's already passed out and hasn't heard. In spite of this, Spencer decides that Jen's the woman he's been looking for and decides to marry her. When Spencer tells his boss, Holbrook (Martin Mull), his plan, the response is that quitting is not an option. Spencer is defiant and goes ahead with his plan. Three years later, they are settled into their new normal life. After Spencer surprises Jen with a remodeled office, she gives him a birthday surprise: tickets to Nice to celebrate his birthday and their three years. Because of his dubious connections to Nice, Spencer is less than enthusiastic.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party? , can you please find it?   Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.

If Thus, there is a business incentive for any postal provider (who is not simply a cream skimmer) to offer universal service within the territories it serves., can we conclude that \\"Postal providers do not desire to provide service to everyone in their territories. \\"?","output":"Based on the given statement, we cannot conclude that \\"Postal providers do not desire to provide service to everyone in their territories\\". In fact, the statement suggests the opposite. It implies that postal providers do have a business incentive to offer universal service within the territories they serve, which means they are inclined to provide services to everyone within those territories.  The statement argues against the idea of \\"cream skimming,\\" a concept where service providers choose to serve only the most profitable parts of a market while neglecting the less profitable areas. In the context of postal services, cream skimming would mean not serving remote or rural areas where the costs of service are higher. However, the statement provided implies that there is a business advantage to provide universal service to everyone in the territories, despite the different costs associated with each area. Postal providers who do not engage in cream-skimming are more likely to offer such universal service. The reasons for postal providers to offer universal service could be diverse, such as: 1. Maintaining market share and customer loyalty: By servicing the entire territory, postal providers can hold a competitive advantage over those who don't. Further, if a postal provider offers services to the entire population, they are more likely to have loyal customers who consistently utilize their services. 2. Regulatory and/or government requirements: In some jurisdictions, postal service providers may be required by law to provide services to everyone in the territory (often with a Universal Service Obligation). This ensures that essential postal services are available to all citizens, regardless of their location or income. 3. Economies of scale: By offering universal service, postal providers can take advantage of economies of scale, which means they can decrease their average cost per unit through increased production. With a broader service area, they can achieve better efficiency in their operations and ultimately offer more competitive pricing. 4. Reputation and branding: Providing services to everyone in the territory can help postal providers establish a strong reputation and brand image. This can lead to additional business through word-of-mouth marketing, as well as a general perception of quality and reliability. 5. Long-term profitability: While serving remote or less profitable areas may yield lower profit margins, maintaining a presence in those regions could result in future economic growth. As these areas grow, the overall profitability of providing postal services to them could increase. In conclusion, we cannot derive from the given statement that postal providers do not desire to provide service to everyone in their territories. On the contrary, the statement highlights the business incentive for postal providers to offer universal service within the territories they serve. This, in turn, suggests that they are interested in serving the entire population within their area of operation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969 in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood in New York City, and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. In 1998, Combs started a clothing line, Sean John. It was nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000, and won in 2004. California billionaire Ronald Burkle invested 100 million into the company in 2003.  Also in 2003, the National Labor Committee revealed that factories producing the clothing in Honduras were violating Honduran labor laws. Among the accusations were that workers were subjected to body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests. Bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled. Employees were forced to work overtime and were paid sweatshop wages. Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee told The New York Times that \\"Sean Puff Daddy obviously has a lot of clout, he can literally do a lot overnight to help these workers.\\"  Combs responded with an extensive investigation, telling reporters \\"I'm as pro-worker as they get\\". On February 14, 2004, Kernaghan announced that improvements had been implemented at the factory, including adding air conditioning and water purification systems, firing the most abusive supervisors, and allowing the formation of a labor union. In late 2006, the department store Macy's removed Sean John jackets from their shelves when they discovered that the clothing was made using raccoon dog fur. Combs had not known the jackets were made with dog fur, but as soon as he was alerted, he had production stopped.  In November 2008, Combs added a men's perfume called \\"I Am King\\" to the Sean John brand. The fragrance, dedicated to Barack Obama, Muhammad Ali, and Martin Luther King, featured model Bar Refaeli in its advertisements. In early 2016, Sean John introduced the brand's GIRLS collection.

Realizing her mistake, Lindsey immediately feels guilty about the situation as she knows how much Kayla's purse means to her. As a gesture of goodwill and taking responsibility for the mishap, Lindsey apologizes to Kayla for causing the stain on her purse. She admits that it was her carelessness that led to the ink stains and assures Kayla that she will do her best to clean it. Wanting to show genuine remorse, Lindsey searches for solutions to remove ink stains from Kayla's purse effectively. She spends time researching different methods to clean the specific type of material the purse is made of, whether it is leather, fabric, or a synthetic material. After gathering the required information, Lindsey prepares the necessary cleaning solution. For instance, if the purse is made of leather, Lindsey might use a combination of rubbing alcohol or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, a cotton swab, and a clean cloth to remove the stains. If the purse is made of fabric, she might use a mix of water, white vinegar, and dish soap to clean the stains. In case the purse is made of synthetic material, Lindsey could use a non-acetone nail polish remover to clean the affected area. Lindsey initiates the cleaning process by first testing the cleaning solution on a hidden area of the purse to ensure it won't damage the material further. Once confident that the cleaning solution is suitable, she treats the ink-stained area with great care, using moderate pressure to avoid damaging it. As Lindsey works on removing the stain, she continuously communicates with Kayla, keeping her updated about the progress and seeking her opinion on the outcome.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Beware! Product review: I hope that this DVD edition might solve a problem that haunts every single presentation of this movie: it is pitched almost a 4th above of the original opera pitch!Even for listeners with no perfect pitch, the experience of G. Reich voice sounding like a tenor would be a frustrating one!","output":"The given review definitely provides some valuable information that could impact my decision to buy the product. Here, I will analyze the review comprehensively to determine whether it would decrease or increase the chances of purchasing the product. The review title, \\"Beware!\\" immediately serves as a warning to potential buyers. It suggests that there may be a problem with the product that the reviewer feels others should know about before deciding to purchase it. Therefore, initially, the title would contribute to a decrease in the likelihood of buying the product. Moving on to the product review itself, it focuses on a specific issue: the DVD edition of a movie being pitched almost a 4th above of the original opera pitch. For those who value the authentic experience and original opera pitch, this presents a valid concern that could negatively affect their viewing experience. This issue could be particularly significant for those who have perfect pitch or are well-versed in the opera world. As a result, the presence of this problem would decrease the chances of buying the product for such individuals. However, it is essential to consider the target audience and personal preferences in this scenario. For those who do not possess perfect pitch or might not be bothered by the difference in pitch, this issue might not influence their decision as heavily. The reviewer does mention that \\"even for listeners with no perfect pitch, the experience of G. Reich voice sounding like a tenor would be a frustrating one,\\" but it is essential to recognize that this opinion may not apply to everyone. Additionally, the review does not touch upon other aspects of the DVD edition, such as video quality, additional features, or overall production value. For some individuals, these factors might carry more weight in their decision-making process. If these other aspects receive positive reviews or are known to be of high quality, it could serve to increase the chances of purchasing the product despite the mentioned issue. In conclusion, the given review would predominantly decrease the chances of buying the product due to the highlighted pitch problem that could potentially affect the overall experience, especially for those who value the original opera pitch or have perfect pitch. However, the impact of this review on the purchasing decision may vary based on personal preferences, the importance of the mentioned issue, and other factors related to the DVD edition's quality and features not covered in the review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan and Barrie's own novelization of it, Peter and Wendy. The music is mostly by Mark \\"Moose\\" Charlap, with additional music by Jule Styne, and most of the lyrics were written by Carolyn Leigh, with additional lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The original 1954 Broadway production, starring Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard as Captain Hook, earned Tony Awards for both stars. It was followed by NBC telecasts of it in 1955, 1956, and 1960 with the same stars, plus several rebroadcasts of the 1960 telecast. The Jolly Roger  Hook revels in his success (\\"Hook's Waltz\\"). As the plank is prepared, Hook hears the tick-tock of the crocodile and panics. It is actually Peter with a clock, and while Hook cowers Peter and the Boys help the Indians, the animals and Liza onto the ship and hide. Peter hides in a closet and kills two pirates Hook sends in. A third pirate, Starkey, refuses to obey Hook's order to go in and jumps overboard. The pirates then carry the Boys in, and the Boys pretend to be afraid as they are carried in. Peter disguises himself as a pirate, and the pirates think the \\"doodle-doo\\" (named so because Peter still crows after killing the pirates) killed all the Boys. Hook believes the ship is now cursed, and everyone thinks Wendy is the source. The pirates push Wendy to the plank. Peter ditches his disguise and the Indians and animals attack, as well as the Boys who are alive and armed. The pirates are all defeated, and Peter challenges Hook to a duel and defeats him. Hook threatens to blow up the ship with a bomb, but runs into the real crocodile (whom Peter also brought on the ship). Peter catches the dropped bomb and tosses it in the sea after Hook slides down the plank (which is shaped like a slide) with the crocodile chasing behind him. As Peter puts his fingers in his ears, the bomb explodes and Hook is either blown to smithereens or is eaten by the crocodile. Everyone sings Peter's praises (\\"I've Gotta Crow\\" [reprise]). Before the Darling children and the Lost Boys go to London, Liza asks Peter to teach her to crow (\\"I Gotta Crow\\" [2nd reprise]).  Back home, the Darlings sit by the nursery window night after night, hoping for the return of their children. The children silently reappear and sing to their mother (\\"Tender Shepherd\\" [reprise]). The Darlings happily agree to adopt the Lost Boys (\\"We Will Grow Up\\"). Wendy promises to wait for Peter, hoping that one day he will return for her.  Years pass, and Peter returns to the nursery, surprising a much older Wendy, who no longer expected him. He has come to take her to Neverland for Spring cleaning, but she declines as she is now grown up; married with a daughter of her own, Jane. Peter starts to cry, and Wendy leaves the room at the sound of her husband's offstage voice. Jane awakes and, like her mother before her, asks, \\"Boy, why are you crying?\\" Peter introduces himself, but Jane knows all about him from her mother's stories. She has been waiting for him to come take her to Neverland and to learn to fly. Peter, now happy again, throws fairy dust on her, but as they are about to leave, Wendy tries to stop them, saying, \\"Oh, if only I could go with you!\\" In the most poignant moment of the show, Peter answers with a sad but understanding smile, \\"You can't. You see, Wendy ... you're too grown up\\". And so Wendy reluctantly lets Jane go, \\"just for Spring cleaning.\\" Her daughter and the \\"boy who wouldn't grow up\\" fly off into the night as Wendy watches from the window.

Elena never seemed to care about others' feelings, only focusing on what she wanted at the moment.  Step 1: Understand the story so far - The story talks about Elena and Tanya with regard to a cake. - It specifically points out that Elena always took more cake than Tanya. - Elena's greediness is highlighted in the story. Step 2: Develop the story further - Introduce how Elena's greediness affects her relationship with Tanya. - Bring in other characters and situations to show the consequences of Elena's greediness. - Try to create a situation where Elena might learn a lesson or realize the consequences of her actions. Continuing the story: Tanya, on the other hand, was much more considerate and tried to make sure everyone got a fair share. This led to many disputes between the two friends whenever dessert was involved. Tanya often found herself wondering why Elena was so incredibly selfish when it came to treats. One day, during a birthday party, Elena's greediness reached a boiling point. The birthday boy, Tim, was about to cut the cake when Elena pushed her way to the front and grabbed the biggest slice for herself. The shocked and disappointed expressions on the faces of Tim and the other guests were unmistakable. But Elena, as usual, was rather oblivious to the effect her actions had on others. Tanya had enough. She pulled Elena aside and confronted her about her behavior. Elena, feeling attacked, tried to brush it off, but Tanya remained firm. She explained that if Elena continued to act this way, people would not want to spend time with her, and she risked losing friends, including Tanya herself. For the first time, Elena began to see the consequences of her greedy behavior. It wasn't just about getting a bigger piece of cake; it was about respect, empathy, and the long-term effects her actions had on friendships. As a result, Elena made a conscious effort to change and become a more considerate person, not just for Tanya, but for all the people in her life. The road to change was not easy, but with Tanya's support and the lessons she had learned, Elena was determined to be a better friend and person."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Look for salt made for horses at your local pet store or feed store and buy it in bulk. Check that the salt is not a mineral salt blend, such as red salt, or salt that is meant for de-icing roads.","output":"When you have the appropriate salt, decide on the type of salt lick you would like to create, whether it be a block, loose salt, or a hanging option, and gather necessary materials to construct the salt lick. If you've chosen to make a block, you can use a mold or create one by cutting the top off of a milk carton or similar container and rinsing it thoroughly. Mix the salt with a small amount of water, just enough to form a slushy consistency, and pour this mixture into the mold. Allow the mixture to set for several hours, or until it hardens completely, and then carefully remove the hardened salt lick from its mold. If you prefer a loose salt option, place the salt in a shallow, weather-proof container, such as a plastic tray or bowl, and position it securely in your horse's paddock or stall to prevent it from being knocked over. Alternatively, for a hanging salt lick, drill a hole through the center of a hardened salt block and thread a sturdy rope or chain through the hole. Secure the salt lick to a fence or post within reach of your horse, making sure it is hanging at an appropriate height for easy access.

No; \\"Happy afterwards\\" would not be a valid answer to the question \\"How would Bailey feel afterwards?\\" when considering the situation in which Bailey eventually realizes that he had forgotten her birthday. It is unlikely that Bailey would feel happy upon realizing that he forgot something as significant as a loved one's birthday.  In general, when people forget important events or milestones for someone they care for, it often leads to negative emotions such as guilt, remorse, or embarrassment. Forgetting a birthday might make Bailey feel guilty for not remembering an important day and potentially disappointing or hurting the other person. It could also trigger embarrassment as others might view it as a sign of negligence or lack of attentiveness. Furthermore, Bailey might feel the need to make it up to the person whose birthday was forgotten, which could involve apologizing, explaining the situation, and trying to find a way to celebrate the missed occasion. This desire to mend the relationship and make amends could result in feelings of stress or anxiety if Bailey struggles to come up with an appropriate way to rectify the situation. Thus, given the emotional implications of forgetting someone's birthday, \\"happy afterwards\\" would not be a sensible answer to the question of how Bailey would feel in this scenario.

In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts.

Alfonso died in Zamora, probably in 910. His former realm would be reunited when first García died childless and León passed to Ordoño.

Due to his refusal to wear the prison uniform, he is labeled \\"non-cooperative\\" and is sent to his cell naked, with only a blanket for warmth. His new roommate, Gerry (Liam McMahon), has smeared the cell with faeces from floor to ceiling and we witness their resistance to the prison regime. The two men get to know each other, as we see them living in the cell.During a visitor day, Gerry's girlfriend sneaks in a small radio by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina.Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, which are grown as part their protest. The prisoners resist with Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender) spitting in Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only this time missing, and punching the wall in the process, which causes his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard, then has his men throw Sands in the bath tub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again in the same brutal manner as before. Lohan is then seen washing his hands as his hands are bloodied, in a similar way similar to the first scene.Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards can be seen and heard snickering, as the clothes handed to the prisoners. Sands' initial action to this process is to tear up his clothes and wreck his cell, to which the rest of the prisoners mirror in their own cells. For the next interaction with the prisoners, a large number of riot officers are seen arriving at the prison on a truck. They line up and beat their batons against their shields and scream to scare the prisoners, who are hauled from their cells, then thrown in...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Who has performed in more bands, Paul Rodgers or Rob Beckley? Answer:","output":"To answer the question of who has performed in more bands, Paul Rodgers or Rob Beckley, we must first explore each musician's history of their respective bands and musical associations.  Paul Rodgers is a renowned English singer, songwriter, and musician. He has made a substantial contribution to the world of music through his powerful voice and songwriting prowess. His career took off during the late 1960s and he has remained active in the music scene ever since. Here is a breakdown of the prominent bands and projects Paul Rodgers has been a part of: 1. Free (1968-1973) - Forming the band Free allowed Rodgers to gain fame as a rock vocalist. Known for the hit song \\"All Right Now,\\" Free remained active until its disbandment in 1973. 2. Bad Company (1973-1982, 1998-2002, 2008-2010) – After Free's breakup, Rodgers formed Bad Company with Mott the Hoople's guitarist, Mick Ralphs. With major hits like \\"Feel Like Making Love\\" and \\"Can't Get Enough,\\" Bad Company enjoyed tremendous success and influence in the 1970s and early 1980s. Rodgers left the band in 1982 but later re-formed and played with them again between 1998-2002 and 2008-2010.  3. The Firm (1984-1986) – Rodgers teamed up with Led Zeppelin’s guitarist, Jimmy Page, to form The Firm, which lasted for two years and produced two albums.  4. The Law (1991-1992) – A collaboration with ex-Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones led to the formation of this brief rock duo who released just one album. 5. Rodgers recently embarked on a solo career and released several solo albums from the 1980s onwards.  6. Queen + Paul Rodgers (2004-2009) – In 2004, Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen invited Rodgers to be the band's frontman. This collaboration resulted in the project “Queen + Paul Rodgers”. The trio released an album, \\"The Cosmos Rocks,\\" and performed on a global tour.  Rob Beckley, on the other hand, is an American singer and guitarist known for his work in the Christian rock genre. His bands and projects include: 1. Pillar (1998-present) - Beckley is the lead vocalist and founding member of this Christian rock band formed in 1998. Pillar has released multiple albums to date, garnering positive reception in the Christian rock scene.  2. Beckley has also contributed to some side projects and collaborations within the Christian music community. If we compare the two musicians, it becomes evident that Paul Rodgers has performed in more bands than Rob Beckley. Paul Rodgers has been associated with at least six diverse musical projects, including Free, Bad Company, The Firm, The Law, his solo career, and Queen + Paul Rodgers. In contrast, Rob Beckley has mainly performed with Pillar alongside a few side projects. Therefore, Paul Rodgers has been a part of more bands and associations throughout his musical career compared to Rob Beckley."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Examine the premise The premise states that \\"He was of middle height, and squarely built to match his jaw.\\" This statement is clearly talking about the physical appearance of a person. Step 2: Identify the relevant part of the premise Since we are trying to analyze if the person has a jaw or not, the important part of the premise to focus on is \\"squarely built to match his jaw.\\" Step 3: Analyze the phrase The phrase \\"squarely built to match his jaw\\" indicates that the person's build is proportional to or resembles their jaw. This means that the person must have a jaw for the comparison to be made in the first place. Step 4: Connect the premise to the hypothesis Since the phrase \\"squarely built to match his jaw\\" establishes that the person has a jaw, we can confidently connect the premise to the hypothesis, which states, \\"He has a jaw.\\" Conclusion: If the premise is true, it is reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis, \\"He has a jaw,\\" is also true."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Michael Jackson's personal artist shared pop king's vision By Edna Gundersen, USA TODAY SANTA FE  Artist David Nordahl was at home painting in February 1988 when the phone rang at midnight. A voice said, \\"This is Yeah, riiiight, he thought. But he quickly realized the call was no prank. While visiting Steven Spielberg's office, Jackson had admired one of Nordahl's paintings of Army troops invading an Apache camp as a young corporal shielded two Indian children. Now the singer was reaching out to the painter. For art lessons. \\"He asked if I taught drawing and painting,\\" says Nordahl, whose realist oils of 19th-century Apaches are highly prized. \\"I told him I didn't, but that I'd think about it. I was really busy.\\" Their hour-long conversation sparked a close friendship and working partnership that led Nordahl to abandon renown in the art world for a cloistered vocation as Jackson's portraitist. From 1988 to 2005, Nordahl completed thousands of drawings and roughly a dozen epic commissions, seven of which were among 2,000 Jackson items in Julien's authorized auction, which the singer sued to stop last spring. Many canvases encapsulate Jackson's grandiose fantasies and fairy-tale worldview. In a massive triptych, he is crowned and knighted in royal robes. Along the sunlit path in Field of Dreams, he leads children of all nationalities (plus sister Janet, AIDS activist Ryan White and actor Macaulay Culkin). His firstborn son snoozes on an oversized golden throne in Prince, The Boy King. Nordahl, 68, became not only Jackson's favorite living artist (Michelangelo led the historic ranking) but a trusted adviser and confidant who designed Neverland carnival rides and joined family outings. He ducked the media for years, \\"because they wanted to talk about negative stuff, and I don't know anything bad about Michael,\\" the soft-spoken Nordahl says, sitting with artist/wife Lori Peterson and frisky cat Scooter in a living room crowded with paintings by the couple. He's speaking now in hopes of brightening a picture darkened since Jackson's death June 25. \\"I always thought of him as normal,\\" he says. \\"He's the most thoughtful, respectful person I've ever met. In 20 years, I never heard him raise his voice.\\" Nordahl's Jackson period began after the singer invited him to the Denver stop of the Bad tour in March 1988. \\"I didn't know what to expect,\\" Nordahl says. \\"He was sweet. We went to galleries, bookstores and a private showing of the King Tut exhibit. We sat around and laughed and talked and drew.\\" Jackson demonstrated talent but was stretched too thin to pursue visual arts. Instead, the two began hatching ideas for Nordahl to paint. The artist conceived the inaugural work, Playmates for a Lonely Child, a 41-inch-square oil of Jackson in a sylvan storybook scene. Next Nordahl embarked on a far bolder statement, Field of Dreams, a 36-by-104-inch oil study for an unfinished work that would have measured 12 by 38 feet. He labored non-stop: large portraits, mythical tableaux, 10-foot charcoal drawings, a plaque on the Neverland gate. Nordahl billed Jackson in line with his earlier gallery rates, up to 150,000 for large pieces, and says he was always paid. His duties expanded to amusement park design after Jackson began developing the ranch north of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Nordahl juggled several projects while adapting to Jackson's enchanted lifestyle. At Neverland, the two tested rides and tended the exotic menagerie. They took trips to Disneyland and spent time at billionaire Ron Burkle's La Jolla, Calif., estate, where Jackson's insomnia often meant Nordahl was enlisted for wee-hour practical jokes and beachside chats. (He also was a victim of Jackson's notorious tricks, once finding his briefcase stuffed with bubblegum.) He discovered the unglamorous Jackson, who in the late '80s often drove by himself in a Chevy Blazer (and relieved himself in a bucket because he couldn't risk being mobbed at gas stations) and lived in a two-bedroom Los Angeles condo. \\"I expected a penthouse with maids,\\" Nordahl says. \\"There was a grand piano pushed into the kitchen, a popcorn machine and a good sound system. The other furniture, you couldn't have gotten 50 bucks for it at a garage sale. Before the kids, Michael lived real simply.\\" \\"I grew up in a difficult home, and he did too,\\" says Nordahl, whom Jackson thanks in liner notes for 1991's Dangerous and 1995's HIStory. \\"We had no playtime growing up. We're both fanatical about work. Born in Albert Lea, Minn., Nordahl left home at 12 and supported himself through high school by working on farms, pinstriping cars and selling his art. \\"I can't remember not drawing,\\" he says. \\"I had an abusive, alcoholic father, and drawing is something that takes you out of the real world. I was always interested in cowboys and Indians. I sold drawings of the Lone Ranger to my classmates.\\" He began specializing in Apaches after moving to Steamboat Springs, Colo., in 1977, and his detailed, meticulously researched depictions soon lured collectors. \\"His work had a lot of integrity, and he was one of those rare artists who was humble but extremely talented,\\" says prominent Santa Fe art dealer Ray Dewey, who held lotteries to determine buyers of Nordahl's work because of high demand. \\"His technique took a long time, so he was not prolific. When he talked to me about leaving to paint for Michael Jackson, I had over 200 people on a waiting list for his work. It was an interesting decision on his part. \\"I think what Jackson saw in David was a complete artist,\\" Dewey says. \\"He was a perfectionist. He choreographed everything. Jackson also may have seen his commitment to family. David primarily painted the Apache people's culture and lifeways, but he painted a lot of children, not just warriors. And he painted animals beautifully, especially horses.\\" What Nordahl saw in Jackson was a wounded and misunderstood genius who felt spiritually obligated to help children. Though Jackson was acquitted in his 2005 child sexual abuse trial, it \\"broke his spirit,\\" Nordahl says. \\"Michael would never molest a child. He always felt so bad for kids who were mistreated or sick. He spent so much time with critically ill kids. If a mother called about a dying child somewhere, he'd jump on a plane. \\"People talked about Neverland being his private amusement park. It was always meant for kids. The last time I was at the ranch, they put up a big Sony JumboTron across from a condo building for sick children, so if kids woke up at night, cartoons would be on.\\" 'Michael was a real dad' Nordahl was bewildered that Jackson seemed to elicit more mockery than sympathy. \\"People accused him of trying to be white, which is ridiculous,\\" he says. \\"When I first met him, his vitiligo (a skin disorder that causes pigmentation loss) had gone to the right side of his face and down his neck. Most of his right hand was white. Stark white patches. He used makeup because he had to. Without it, he was speckled all over.\\" Nordahl never witnessed drug use by Jackson but was keenly aware of pain problems that lingered after the star's hair caught fire on a Pepsi ad soundstage. \\"When they were trying to repair that burned spot, he had a balloon under his scalp that was inflated,\\" Nordahl says. \\"He let me feel it. It was a huge mound. As the skin got stretched, they cut it out and stitched the scalp. He was in excruciating pain.\\" Jackson seemed an unlikely addict, Nordahl says, noting his avoidance of cigarettes, alcohol, soft drinks and sugar. \\"He was mostly a vegetarian,\\" he says. \\"When he was on tour, the cooks would make him eat fish and sometimes chicken. He loved little chicken wings. He always drank water. I shared wine with him only twice, once with (ex-wife) Lisa Marie (Presley) and once at Ron Burkle's house. Michael had one glass.\\" The clearest evidence of Jackson's responsible nature emerged in his parenting of Prince, Paris and Blanket. \\"Michael was a real dad, not a Hollywood dad,\\" he says. \\"He'd get up at night to feed them bottles. He'd change them, bathe them, everything a mother does. \\"All the time I spent with those kids, I never heard them beg for anything or throw a fit. I never heard them cry. They were so well-adjusted.\\" Jackson took pains not to spoil his children, says Nordahl, recalling a modest eighth birthday party in L.A. for Prince. (Jackson's mother, Katherine, and sister Rebbie came over but skipped the festivities because of their Jehovah's Witness beliefs, he says.) \\"I was curious to see what Prince was going to get,\\" Nordahl says. \\"I figured it would be pretty extravagant, but he didn't get one thing that cost over 2. He got Play-Doh, little action figures, things we'd call stocking stuffers. \\"The kids were not allowed to watch TV or DVDs or play video games\\" except through points earned by their schoolwork. \\"Nothing was given to them. Michael said, 'I want them to grow up as close to normal as possible.' Those kids were so respectful and courteous, just sweet.\\" Surprise visit to Santa Fe Nordahl grew close to all three. Typically, the artist spent time with the Jackson brood on the West Coast. But over Memorial Day weekend in 2004, the star and his tykes surprised Nordahl by visiting Santa Fe via Jackson's plush private bus (with a 60-inch plasma TV). Jackson suggested a movie outing. \\"I thought we were going to a screening room,\\" Nordahl says. \\"His driver pulled into DeVargas Mall. He was friends with (Roland Emmerich), the director of The Day After Tomorrow, and it was opening weekend. The mall was jammed, and there was no place to park. I took the kids, got the tickets and popcorn, and we went in. Michael came in after the lights went down. \\"The lights came up, and nobody noticed him. He had on a baseball cap and these Chinese silk pajamas. The kids had no masks on. Any of those rags would have paid 100,000 for that picture.\\" He last saw Jackson in 2005, when the singer moved to Bahrain and vowed never again to live on U.S. soil. Accustomed to lulls when Jackson was overseas or overextended, Nordahl resumed painting Apaches and presumed he'd be summoned once Jackson found a new home and showcase for his treasures. The fate of Nordahl's Jackson paintings is in limbo, though they may be part of a touring exhibition of the singer's memorabilia proposed by the estate administrators. \\"I would like to see them in a Michael Jackson museum,\\" Nordahl says. \\"That was always Michael's goal. He was very self-effacing, but he understood he was a music icon.\\" Nordahl, represented by Settlers West Galleries in Tucson and Sherwoods Spirit of America in Santa Fe, has returned to painting Apaches and other subjects. Whether his extended hiatus from the public eye damaged his authority or reputation \\"is difficult to gauge,\\" Dewey says. \\"I don't know if it furthered his career. An artist who does commissions for one patron often is just isolated unless the patron publishes or exhibits the work. David's always been independent, and he's never sought publicity.\\" And how many patrons are the King of Pop? \\"We got to be such good friends that I forgot who I was hanging out with,\\" Nordahl says. \\"Then he'd break into these dance moves, quick as lightning, and it would dawn on me: He's the best entertainer in the world.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Question: Who discovers the murder scene? Movie title: The Devil's Rejects Movie plot: On May 18, 1978, Texas Sheriff John Quincey Wydell and a large posse of State Troopers issue a Search and Destroy mission on the Firefly family for over 75 homicides and disappearances over the past several years. The family arm themselves and fire on the officers. Rufus is killed and Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) is taken into custody, while Otis and Baby escape. They steal a car, and after killing the driver, they go to Kahiki Palms, a run-down motel. While at the motel, Otis and Baby take a band called Banjo and Sullivan hostage in their room, and Otis shoots the roadie when he returns. Meanwhile, Baby's father, Captain Spaulding, decides to rendezvous with Baby and Otis. En route, his truck runs out of gas and he assaults a woman before stealing her car. Back at the motel, Otis sexually assaults Roy's wife Gloria and demands Adam and Roy come with him on an errand. Otis drives his two prisoners to a place where he buried weapons. While walking to the location, the two prisoners attack Otis, but he bludgeons Roy and cuts Adam's face off. Back at the motel, Adam's wife Wendy tries to escape out the bathroom window. When Gloria attempts to rebel, Baby kills her. Wendy runs out of the motel, but is caught by Captain Spaulding, who knocks her unconscious. Otis returns, and all three leave the motel together in the band's van. The motel maid comes to clean the room, and discovers the murder scene. The maid enters the bathroom, where she sees \\"The Devil's Rejects\\" written on the wall in blood, and is startled by Wendy, who is accidentally killed when she runs out to the highway to seek help. Wydell calls a pair of amoral bounty hunters â the \\"Unholy Two\\" â Rondo and Billy Ray, to help him find the Fireflys.

To find the answer he did two tests, test A and test B. In test A he warmed up the reactants, but in test B he cooled down the reactants. To see a practical example of these tests he conducted two more tests, test C and test D. In test C he kept a food item in the refrigerator, but in test D he kept the same food item on the table top.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would particles of reactants in test A have lower or higher energy than particles in test B? Answer:","output":"The particles of reactants in test A would have higher energy than the particles in test B. This is because, in test A, John warmed up the reactants, which means he increased their temperature. An increase in temperature leads to an increase in the average kinetic energy of the particles, as they gain energy and move more quickly. Consequently, the particles collide more frequently and with higher impact, thus increasing the rate of the chemical reaction. In contrast, in test B, John cooled down the reactants, causing their temperature to decrease. Lowering the temperature results in a decrease in the average kinetic energy of the particles, as they lose energy and move more slowly. As a result, the particles collide less frequently and with less force, causing the chemical reaction rate to slow down. The practical examples from tests C and D further support this concept, as the food item kept in the refrigerator (test C) would have a slower rate of decomposition – a chemical reaction – than the food item left on the table top (test D). This is because the lower temperature inside the refrigerator slows down the decomposition processes, while the higher temperature at room conditions speeds up the reaction rate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck. Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it. Williamson County population : 226,257 Wayne County population : 16,583 I ran a business with my father, graduated from a high school that was ranked 24/273 instead of one ranked of 223/273 in the state.

I picked this up in the 'Danger After Dark' box set, and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of Hyde and Gackt. I expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore-fest and with very bad dialogue. Which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in America. Instead I found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters, and the way that Sho (Gackt) develops through the movie as a person. The acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good, considering they aren't professional actors, and the director did a marvelous job with it all, setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards. On a side note, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other film I've seen him in is Battle Royale, where he plays Shogo Kawada, and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is bright, exuberant and hyper, serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics. Shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it. So, watch out for his performance, if you're familiar with Battle Royale, you'll be very surprised by him. But don't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box, because this isn't really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire in it. That Hyde's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the foreground, and you guys will love the last scene.

To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to  charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In which case the objects would be closer to each other, case A or case B?  Hint: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. A:","output":"In case A, the objects would be closer to each other. This is because case A involves charging by conduction, which requires the objects to be in direct contact with each other for electrons to migrate and even out the charge.

Надпечатка Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The term \\"Надпечатка\\" in Russian can be translated to \\"Overprint\\" in English.  Overprint refers to the process of printing additional layers of ink or toner onto a substrate that has already been printed, such as paper or any other material. This technique is widely used in the printing industry for various purposes, including the creation of special effects, enhanced security features, and the correction of errors. Below are some examples of how overprinting is used: 1. Security Features: Overprint can be used to add unique holographic images, watermarks, or microtext patterns to important documents such as banknotes, passports, or certificates. These added security features make it difficult for counterfeiters to produce forgeries. 2. Error Correction: If there is a mistake on a printed material that has already been printed, an overprint can be applied to correct the error without having to reprint the entire batch. This can save significant time and money for the printer. 3. Visual Effects: Overprinting different colors of ink can create unique visual effects that enhance the aesthetics of the printed material. For instance, when two transparent inks are overprinted, the overlaps may produce a third color. This is often used in the creation of high-quality artworks and posters. 4. Postage Stamps: Overprints are commonly used to update or modify postage stamps. For example, when a country changes its currency or when there's a temporary shortage of a particular stamp denomination, overprints may be applied to existing stamps to denote the new value or to mark them as valid for use. 5. Promotional Materials: Overprints can be used on promotional materials such as brochures, flyers, or business cards. By adding a special promotion, limited-time offer, or event information, these materials can be updated or customized without having to redesign and reprint the entire piece. Overall, overprinting is an important technique in the printing industry that offers practical solutions for correcting errors, enhancing security features, creating visually appealing effects, and updating printed materials efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kai's intention behind buying Remy ice cream was to cheer him up, which reflects an empathetic and caring attitude. Therefore, it is clear that Kai's motivation was not to be rude, but rather to offer comfort and support. Instead, a more appropriate response could be, \\"Kai did this to lift Remy's spirits and make him feel better.\\" This answer accurately captures Kai's motive and highlights the positive intentions behind his action. Kai's decision to buy ice cream for Remy is rooted in their relationship and an understanding of Remy's emotions.

Such gestures are aimed at making the receiver feel cared for and valued, which is quite the opposite of being rude or inconsiderate.

Trusting to his skill in reading faces, he waited impatiently for morning, resolving to say nothing to anyone but Mrs. Snowdon, and from her merely to inquire what the note contained.  Treherne usually was invisible till lunch, often till dinner; therefore, fearing to excite suspicion by unwonted activity, he did not appear till noon.

Vinyl record revival spins success for Czech producer GZ Media employee Petra Kottova checks the sound quality of a pressed vinyl record at the company's factory in Lodenice. Photograph: Petr Josek/Reuters When vinyl record sales hit bottom in the late 1980s, managers at Czech record producer GZ Media in a small town near Prague were wondering what to do with their idle record pressing machines. They decided not to get rid of them and put them in garages at the company's backyard. That proved to be a wise decision. As vinyl retro-mania started spreading around the world a decade later the firm dusted off the presses, and it is now spinning profits on records for the likes of the Rolling Stones, U2, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. With 7m records made in 2012 and 10m expected to be produced this year, GZ Media says it is the world's biggest vinyl record producer, making records for Universal Music Group and Sony Music, and is beginning to co-operate with Warner Music. \\"Vinyl is an inscrutable animal,\\" Jiri Hasek, the company's commercial director told Reuters. \\"Everybody is waiting for when the growth will slow, but instead it keeps accelerating.\\" Vinyl record production accounts for about 30% of GZ Media's sales, which reached 1.8bn crowns (93m) last year. The company also makes sophisticated packaging for expensive consumer goods such as mobile phones, electronics and whisky. Founded in 1948 as Gramofonove Zavody Lodenice, the central record producer in the then-communist bloc, GZ Media pressed its first record in 1951. During the 1980s demand for vinyl records began to ebb as CDs and DVDs emerged. Production bottomed out in the early 1990s when GZ Media was producing only about 200,000 records a year. In 1989 the communist regime collapsed and GZ Media was up for grabs as part of a nationwide privatisation programme. It ended up in the hands of US fund Winslow Partners, which later sold it to the firm's own management. Last Christmas it made a special Beatles recording gift box approved by Paul McCartney and is now working on a special gift packaging of The Who discography. According to the Official Charts Company, vinyl record sales in the UK, one of GZ Media's main markets, have reached 375,000 so far in 2013, which compares with 393,000 for the whole of 2012 and 227,000 in 2009. \\"For uber-fans of a particular band, getting the vinyl edition is a really important souvenir and mark of their commitment to the artist,\\" said Steve Redmond, a spokesman for the Entertainment Retailers Association in the UK. He said vinyl was \\"an inevitable reaction\\" to the rise of digital music, which offers little room for cover art and the kind of tangibility that people were used to. \\"It's never going to return to where it was, when it was the lead format for the industry,\\" Redmond said. \\"But I think it is a far bigger niche than people anticipated that it was going to be and, at the moment, is continuing to grow at a fairly dramatic pace.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Czech record producer GZ Media has seen significant success in recent years due to the vinyl record revival, as it has kept its record pressing machines from the 1980s and now produces vinyl records for major artists and labels such as the Rolling Stones, U2, Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music. With 7 million records produced in 2012 and 10 million expected for this year, GZ Media claims to be the world's largest vinyl record producer, attributing 30% of its sales to vinyl production, which amounted to 93 million in 2012."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Following the news that Rolling Stone will not punish any writers or editors over its debunked campus rape story, the general reaction from fellow journalists has been a mix of bafflement and indignation.      CNN’s resident media reporter Brian Stelter shared in that reaction, but also posed an interesting question for perspective: How does NBC News anchor Brian Williams feel about this news? The newsman is currently serving a six-month suspension for a (possibly career-ending) string of public embellishments about his own field reporting.      When asked on this morning’s New Day why publisher Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone brass would avoid punishing anyone when so much is on the line, Stelter suggested the move has a lot to do with “loyalty” and “second chances.”      “The writer of the article [Sabrina Erdely] is going to be invited back to Rolling Stone to write more in the future,” he noted. “I do wonder how Brian Williams feels reading about this.”      Rolling Stone chief Wenner referred to the source of the rape allegations as an “expert fabulist,” essentially shifting the blame off his own writers, editors, and fact-checkers. In NBC’s case, however, Williams was not defended in any such manner — instead being labeled a “fabulist” himself by the media.      Also interesting to note: Rolling Stone has fired writers in the past for much lesser offenses than this one.      Stelter concluded today’s recap: “It makes all journalists look bad when there’s a terrible journalistic sin like this one. It hurts the whole profession. And it’s kind of baffling we’re not seeing any disciplinary actions taken.”      Watch below, via CNN:      Please enable Javascript to watch.      [h/t Grabien]      [Image via CNN/screengrab]      — — ||||| LOOK AT YOURSELF      The Columbia Journalism School ripped apart the UVa rape story—but the magazine’s chief blames a fabulist, not his own editors who got played.      They don’t get it; they just don’t get it.      In the Columbia University Journalism School’s 13,000-word postmortem, filled with incriminating details about Rolling Stone’s now-retracted campus rape investigation, the most incriminating detail is that nobody at the magazine seems to believe that its reporting, editorial, and fact-checking practices are in need of serious reform.      “Rolling Stone’s senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story’s failure does not require them to change their editorial systems,” reports the highly anticipated, four-month study of how the magazine ended up publishing “A Rape on Campus,” an error-ridden account that focused on a supposedly savage (yet completely unverified) sexual assault at a University of Virginia frat house. The story, originally published Nov. 19, 2014, was recently deleted from the magazine’s website.      The blockbuster narrative, by Rolling Stone contributing editor Sabrina Rubin Erdely and based largely on the first-person account of a UVa junior and alleged rape victim identified only as “Jackie,” predictably provoked a firestorm of outrage when it was published last fall.      Erdely’s story, which suggested an attitude of indifference at best and cover-up at worst by the UVa administration, prompted a different sort of outrage when her reporting—about Jackie’s claims of a gruesome gang rape at Charlottesville’s Phi Kappa Psi House in September 2012—quickly unraveled under scrutiny from The Washington Post, CNN, and other media outlets.      The Columbia J-School study, which is 4,000 words longer than Rolling Stone’s retracted piece and presented in a tone of restrained neutrality, uncovered numerous instances of journalistic malpractice in the preparation of Erdely’s story: failure to contact and interview Jackie’s friends (to whom she claimed to have given contemporaneous accounts of the vicious assault); failure to verify the existence of the supposed fraternity member, allegedly a lifeguard at the same swimming pool where Jackie worked, who she claimed took her on a date to a Phi Kappa Psi frat party and witnessed and cheered on the gang rape; failure to provide fraternity officials with the specifics of Jackie’s account when asking for comment; and, worst of all, failure to verify the existence of and seek interviews with the alleged perpetrators of the felony.      Yet the Columbia J-School study quotes Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana as stoutly defending the magazine’s procedures: “It’s not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don’t think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things. We just have to do what we’ve always done and just make sure we don’t make this mistake again.”      Coco McPherson, the head of the magazine’s fact-checking department, which also comes under severe criticism in the study, likewise told the authors: “I one hundred percent do not think that the policies that we have in place failed. I think decisions were made around those because of the subject matter.”      And in a comment that is bound stir up further controversy for a magazine that has had a festering PR problem since the article was published, Rolling Stone publisher Jann S. Wenner appeared to absolve his staff and blame Jackie in an interview published Sunday by The New York Times.      Wenner “acknowledged the piece’s flaws but said that it represented an isolated and unusual episode and that Ms. Erdely would continue to write for the magazine,” the Times reported. “The problems with the article started with its source, Mr. Wenner said. He described her as ‘a really expert fabulist storyteller’ who managed to manipulate the magazine’s journalism process. When asked to clarify, he said that he was not trying to blame Jackie, ‘but obviously there is something here that is untruthful, and something sits at her doorstep.’”            Wenner’s attempt to assign responsibility for the bogus story to the alleged victim—rather than the journalists on his payroll—echoed Dana’s initial reaction when the story began to collapse.      “In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie’s account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced,” Dana wrote in an editor’s note—written “very quickly” and “under a lot of pressure,” according to Dana, and posted on Rolling Stone’s website as the journalistic catastrophe unfolded.      The J-school study reports: “That language deflected blame from the magazine to its subject and it attracted yet more criticism. Dana said he rued his initial wording. ‘I was pretty freaked out,’ he said. ‘I regretted using that phrase pretty quickly.’ Early that evening, he changed course in a series of tweets. ‘That failure is on us—not on her,’ he wrote. A revised editor’s note, using similar language, appeared the next day.”      The study reports that “the most consequential decision Rolling Stone made was to accept that Erdely had not contacted the three friends who spoke with Jackie on the night she said she was raped. That was the reporting path, if taken, that would have almost certainly led the magazine’s editors to change plans.” When they were interviewed by the Post and other outlets, Jackie’s friends contradicted major elements of her account.      The study continues: “Erdely said that as she was preparing to write her first draft, she talked with [her editor Sean] Woods about the three friends. ‘Sean advised me that for now we should just put this aside,’ she said. ‘He actually suggested that I change their names for now.’ Woods said that he intended this decision to be temporary, pending further reporting and review.”      Erdely “relied solely on Jackie’s information and wrote vividly about how the three friends had reacted after finding Jackie shaken and weeping in the first hours of Sept. 29,” the authors write.      Erdely told them: “In retrospect, I wish somebody had pushed me harder” about reaching out to the three for their versions. “I guess maybe I was surprised that nobody said, ‘Why haven’t you called them?’ But nobody did, and I wasn’t going to press that issue.”      The study concludes: “Of course, just because an editor does not ask a reporter to check derogatory information with a subject, that does not absolve the reporter of responsibility.”      Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason      Remaining a mystery in the J-School study—whose authors enjoyed unfettered access to Rolling Stone’s editors, fact checkers, and reporter along with article drafts, notes, and audio recordings of interviews—is how, why, and whether Rolling Stone’s in-house and outside lawyers approved Erdely’s rape story for publication.      The attorneys, whose job is to limit the magazine’s legal exposure by ensuring that stories are solidly reported and factually supported, refused to talk to Coll et al, arguing attorney-client privilege. Editorial staffers likewise refused to discuss the legal advice they were given. The magazine now possibly faces a defamation lawsuit from Phi Kappa Psi, which has announced that it’s exploring its legal options.      The Columbia J-School study concludes that Rolling Stone’s malfeasance amounts to “a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable.” The study continues: “The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that, if pursued, would likely have led the magazine’s editors to reconsider publishing Jackie’s narrative so prominently, if at all. The published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine’s reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from.”      In a statement timed to the study’s release, Erdely offered her “deepest apologies” to her Rolling Stone readers and colleagues, the UVa community, and “any victims of sexual assault who may feel fearful as a result of my article.” She added: “Reading the Columbia account of the mistakes and misjudgments in my reporting was a brutal and humbling experience.”      With Erdely’s position at the magazine seemingly secure, managing editor Dana, fact checking chief McPherson, and Sean Woods, the article’s principal editor, apparently won’t face any disciplinary action, either. Wenner “has decided not to fire anyone on staff,” CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter reported on Sunday night.      “He believes the missteps were unintentional, not purposefully deceitful.” |||||       The Rolling Stone story in question.      Rolling Stone magazine just plain got it wrong.      That's the conclusion of the massive (and massively long) piece penned by three officials at Columbia University journalism school, a report that details the fact that the story of a gang rape of a woman named \\"Jackie\\" at the University of Virginia was, in fact, simply not right.      So, that's bad enough. What's worse is that the errors made by Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the article's author, and the rest of the Rolling Stone editorial chain were entirely avoidable and encompassed the sort of basic reporting that every student in journalism school should know. Here's the Columbia trio on what happened:      Rolling Stone's repudiation of the main narrative in \\"A Rape on Campus\\" is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable. The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that, if pursued, would likely have led the magazine's editors to reconsider publishing Jackie's narrative so prominently, if at all. The published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine's reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from.      Pretty damning stuff, right? Yes. And yet, Rolling Stone has apparently decided that this whole episode was just a blip on the radar and not at all the sort of thing that Erdely, her editor or anyone else should lose their job(s) for. \\"Sabrina’s done great work for us over the years and we expect that to continue,” Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana told The Washington Post via e-mail.      Um, WHAT?      I am not one to call for other reporters' heads when mistakes are made, as I have made mistakes before and had my head called for. But there are mistakes and then there are MISTAKES. A poorly chosen tweet or, in my case, a poorly conceived and unfunny parody, is one thing. Totally misreporting allegations of a gang rape in a hugely high-profile magazine story is another. One is poor judgement, often in the world of Twitter expressed (and regretted) in a millisecond. What Erdely did is journalistic malpractice, failing to do the basic blocking and tackling of reporting because, frankly, the story she had was just too good to check.      Credibility and its less-often-mentioned-but-no-less-important cousin accountability are all that any journalist has in this business. The practice of journalism broadly imagined is based on lots and lots of individual reporters' credibility that eventually adds up to a reason why we should be trusted to tell you what you want and, more important, need to know.      That's why what Erdely did -- and the stunning lack of accountability from Rolling Stone -- is so problematic for all of us who have dedicated our lives to journalism. Getting the story wrong -- and in such a major way -- obviously erodes our collective credibility. Failing to hold Erdely -- or ANYONE -- accountable for doing their jobs very poorly is even worse. It suggests that not only did journalism swing and miss but we are acting like we are still at the plate and nothing has happened.      Is it any wonder that trust in journalism is down there near Congress levels?      I've always been an ardent defender of journalism from those who insist that we've blown our chance at once again being the authoritative and objective force in society we once were. My argument has always been that, yes, there are a few bad apples, but most people are trying to do their jobs the best way they know how -- honestly and fairly. I still believe that. But, failures like this one by Erdely and Rolling Stone make it much harder for me to make that case even to myself.      Society needs a Fourth Estate that it may not always agree with but that it believes is committed to getting it right and, when it doesn't, taking appropriate action. Rolling Stone did neither of those things with this story. And that's a shame for the rest of us. ||||| With an odd sense of fanfare, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism last night produced a 13,000-word report on Rolling Stone's profoundly flawed account of a gang rape at the University of Virginia, \\"A Rape on Campus,\\" that was published last November. Their conclusion? Rolling Stone fucked up a lot.      Missing from Columbia's intense vivisection of the article, however, was a sense of responsibility: Whose fault was this crime against journalism, exactly? According to Rolling Stone Publisher Jann Wenner, no one's, really. No one at the magazine, a baby-boomer favorite, will be dismissed for journalistic malpractice, even though Wenner loves to fire people for seemingly innocuous transgressions. Will Dana and Sean Woods, who edited the story, tried to resign in December, but were refused. Sabrina Rubin Erdely, who wrote the article, will continue to write for the magazine. Wenner, quoted in the New York Times today, is blaming the victim.      The problems with the article started with its source, Mr. Wenner said. He described her as “a really expert fabulist storyteller” who managed to manipulate the magazine’s journalism process. When asked to clarify, he said that he was not trying to blame Jackie, “but obviously there is something here that is untruthful, and something sits at her doorstep.”      This is an incredible statement coming from a magazine publisher with 40-odd years of experience and three titles under his belt (Us Weekly produces some great journalism) who is known for his mercurial temper and preference for workplace fastidiousness (apparently he values clean desks over clean journalism). Sure, there have been instances of publications getting hosed by young, manipulative employees (Jayson Blair, Stephen Glass), but blaming a source because you did not investigate her thoroughly enough is astonishingly idiotic.      Here's what happened at Rolling Stone: pathological conflict-avoidance. Every workaround deployed in this story, from not securing the alleged rapist's name before publication to not interviewing the rape victim's friends, was put in place in order to avoid a difficult, uncomfortable situation. Underlying it all is sense of grand interpersonal failures. I'm not going to delve into writing Rolling Stone editorial fanfic, but it's fairly clear that something was awry between the personalities at play here. Whether it was regular workaday pressures—\\"Ahh, who has time to scrap the main gang-rape anecdote before deadline and get another?\\"—or something more insidious, whatever culture that bred this story is poisonous. And for Wenner, a rich, powerful 69-year-old man, to place culpability for his magazine's lapse on a twentysomething pseudonymous woman, well, that tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it?      Later in the same Times article, Wenner goes from blaming the article's source to blaming the article's author. A step in the right direction, maybe, but notice here how Wenner paints Erdely as a reckless woman on a mission to bring down the story's editor with her:      Ms. Erdely, Mr. Wenner said, “was willing to go too far in her effort to try and protect a victim of apparently a horrible crime. She dropped her journalistic training, scruples and rules and convinced Sean to do the same. There is this series of falling dominoes.”      \\"Convinced\\" is an interesting word choice here. Who was in charge of this story? Certainly not Erdely. Was Woods's editorial judgment neutered by her passion for rape victims, as Wenner indicates? Considering Erdely's side of the story, as depicted in Columbia's report, Woods was neither a careful, rigorous, thoughtful nor attentive editor. The domino fall should have stopped with him, but it did not, because of his failings—whether he did not stand up to Erdely, did not push her enough, or was inexperienced with the subject matter. Instead, he chose to work around the problem at hand, defusing a potential conflict with Erdely and severely damaging the credibility of her story.      Woods's lack of sensitivity and journalistic finesse is apparent in his boneheaded \\"apology:\\" \\"Ultimately, we were too deferential to our rape victim; we honored too many of her requests in our reporting,\\" Woods said in the Columbia report. \\"We should have been much tougher, and in not doing that, we maybe did her a disservice.\\" Maybe!      In another article in the Times today (today is honorary Rolling Stone Fucked Up day in medialand), Jonathan Mahler, a media reporter, hints that gender might have had something to do with the nuclear fallout of the article.      So what happened with “A Rape on Campus”? It is hard not to wonder if gender was a contributing factor. The magazine’s publisher and managing editor, and the editor of the article, were all men. Did that make them wary, consciously or not, of pushing back against a female writer’s account of a young woman’s rape?      I'll go one step further than Mahler. Yes! Gender definitely had to do with how fucked up this article was. Consider Rolling Stone. A fine magazine, if you're into the Black Crowes, war, and Matt Taibbi. Will Dana and Sean Woods have edited some wonderful dispatches from Baghdad. But as the Columbia report starkly shows, they were clearly entirely out of their wheelhouse when it came to Erdely's report, and instead of, maybe, I don't know, consulting with women, asking women for help, or trying to understand what was at stake, they just barreled on forward like they were still on General McChrystal's plane (it's worth noting that both the head of fact-checking at Rolling Stone and the fact-checker on the story were women, but any higher-level editorial decisions did not fall to them). It brings to mind Grantland's Dr. V disaster—this is what happens when people who think they know everything get too swept up in a story and lose sight of reality. It's very bad.      Rolling Stone's claim that it doesn't need to change anything institutionally is hilariously self-defeating. The ultimate fault of \\"A Rape on Campus\\" does not lie with a bad source, a bad journalist or a couple of bad editors. It falls on the empire's leader, Wenner, who should take full responsibility for the article, fire everyone involved, and then fire himself for being a dumb, sexist idiot.

Here is a news article: She praised the human resource managers gathered for their conference. “You know what it takes to provide workers the flexibility and benefits that they need to care for their children,” she said.      At a time when almost everything Mrs. Clinton publicly says feeds presidential speculation, she has also used the speeches to address issues like the Arab Spring, the conflict in Syria and the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden.      Mrs. Clinton does not make her speechmaking schedule public, but the trade groups typically publicize the events. A spokesman for the former first lady declined to comment.      But her political rivals have already started to keep tabs on her speaking schedule, looking for any hint of a conflict of interest. (So far, Mrs. Clinton’s staff appears to have carefully chosen where she has given speeches, avoiding paid talks to potentially controversial groups.)      “We’re starting immediately to monitor both Hillary and the other Democratic rising stars and collect, tag and characterize their speeches so we can hold them accountable when the campaign begins in earnest,” said Tim Miller, the executive director of America Rising, a conservative political action committee.      Mr. Miller said that it was too early to send operatives to covertly buy tickets to Mrs. Clinton’s speeches, but that the group was watching from a distance “to monitor whether she’s hobnobbing with investment bankers in New York City that might seem like favoritism down the line.”      Since Mrs. Clinton stepped down as secretary of state, she has divided her time between writing a memoir and juggling a growing schedule of engagements, paid and unpaid. The unpaid appearances are typically focused on her advocacy work for women and girls as part of the Clinton Foundation, the charitable organization founded by her husband. (She is not completely avoiding politics, and will campaign for Terry McAuliffe, a family friend who is running for governor of Virginia.) ||||| Hillary Clinton is leading both Chris Christie and Rand Paul in a potential 2016 presidential race, a new poll finds.

Biden was trailing Christie 35 percent to 46 percent and was in a dead heat with Paul at 42 percent.      Part of the explanation may be in the favorability numbers: 55 percent of those surveyed said they viewed Clinton favorably, compared with 38 percent who viewed her unfavorably. Biden, however, was underwater, with 44 percent viewing him unfavorably and 38 percent viewing him favorably.      (PHOTOS: Who’s talking about Hillary 2016?)

(Nicki Demarco/NowThisNews)      Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped down as secretary of state earlier this year, but there has been no shortage of Clinton on the national stage in the past two decades. (Nicki Demarco/NowThisNews)      Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled to Chicago last month to give a major speech in a cavernous convention hall. Her audience was 15,000 human resources professionals, and her remarks were tailored specifically to how immigration reform and President Obama’s health-care overhaul might affect their industry.      In the six months since stepping down as secretary of state, Clinton has addressed apartment-complex developers in Dallas, private-equity managers in Los Angeles and business executives in Grand Rapids, Mich. Still to come are travel agents, real estate brokers, clinical pathologists and car dealers — collecting more than 200,000 per appearance, according to one executive who arranges speaking tours.      This is how Clinton is cashing in on her star power as she weighs whether to run for the White House. The would-be Democratic front-runner is barnstorming the country, delivering speeches and answering questions at events sponsored by industry groups eager to gain access to someone who may be the next president.      Clinton is the only leading 2016 contender giving paid speeches, with at least 14 delivered or scheduled so far, in part because ethics rules prohibit sitting lawmakers from doing so. Past presidential contenders, such as Republicans Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty, gave relatively few such addresses, and for much lower five-figure fees.      A hectic speaking schedule is more common for those who have left electoral politics for good, including her husband, former president Bill Clinton — who has racked up tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees since leaving office — and other former secretaries of state, such as Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright.      1 of 51 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Hillary Rodham Clinton: A political life View Photos Looking back at the career of the secretary of state and former senator and first lady.

Most of the trade groups Clinton has addressed actively lobby Congress on issues both substantial and mundane. The American Society of Travel Agents, which Clinton will address in September, wants airlines to provide data to travel agencies about baggage and boarding fees. The National Multi Housing Council, which Clinton addressed in April, advocates, among other things, low-interest loans for those who deal with bedbug infestations.      When she spoke to the Society for Human Resource Management in June, association chief executive Hank Jackson said, “We were very pleased that most of her speech was tailored towards HR issues.”      “She didn’t realize how intimately involved we are in providing feedback to Congress on how immigration from a practical perspective — not from a political perspective — is affecting businesses’ ability to manage talent,” Jackson said. “Giving her that insight was something that she could take away from the meeting.”      Other audiences have many millions of dollars at stake in federal tax policies. In June, Clinton addressed an investor meeting in Los Angeles of KKR, the private-equity giant, and fielded questions from firm co-founder Henry Kravis. Her appearance, first reported by Politico, was confirmed by a KKR spokeswoman.      Clinton’s spokesman declined to talk publicly about her speaking schedule.      One person familiar with Clinton’s private speeches said she is not being lobbied at the appearances. “She’s talking about her experiences at State, and people have questions that are as you’d expect, but no one’s getting up and lobbying her,” said the person, who discussed the events on the condition of anonymity.      Ron Kaufman, a Republican lobbyist and top adviser to former president George H.W. Bush, said such events allow groups to promote their agendas. “Whether they’re listened to is a different ballgame,” he said. “I think she’s not the kind of person who will be influenced by it, but they can establish pre-communications.”      Clinton’s office does not publicly release her schedule, and most of her paid engagements are closed to the news media. The paid appearances are arranged through the Harry Walker Agency, which also represents her husband.      The agency does not reveal her speaking fee. But one top executive at a rival speakers bureau, who requested anonymity to share internal industry details, said it is more than 200,000.      Former president George W. Bush, by contrast, commands 100,000 to 150,000 per speech, as do former Bush administration officials such as Rice and Powell, the executive said. Only Clinton’s husband is on a par with her in speaking fees among political figures, the executive said.      Many organizations that hire Clinton to speak heavily promote the booking, using her name and portrait to gin up registrations and sales for their conventions.      “These speeches are what an ex-secretary of state, ex-senator, ex-first lady, someone who’s an international star, ought to be making,” said Mickey Kantor, a longtime Clinton family loyalist. “I don’t see anything unusual about it.”      Not much time off      When Clinton left office after traveling to 112 countries in four years, she described herself as exhausted and said she was looking forward to catching up with family and friends, watching home design shows (her favorite is HGTV’s “Love It or List It”), and writing her next book. She also had a blood-clot scare in January that landed her in the hospital for several days.      “I just want to sleep and exercise and travel for fun,” she said in a New York Times interview late last year. “And relax. It sounds so ordinary, but I haven’t done it for 20 years. I would like to see whether I can get untired.”      But Clinton, 65, has not taken much time off since. In addition to her paid appearances, she has given more than a dozen pro bono speeches — in some cases to accept awards, such as the American Bar Association’s ABA Medal, which she will receive in San Francisco next month.      “I am pleased to see that she is not slowing down as Citizen Clinton,” former congresswoman Jane Harman (D-Calif.) said in introducing Clinton at a Bryn Mawr College event Tuesday.      This fall, Clinton’s schedule picks up considerably. In November, Clinton will bounce from Orlando (the Learning 2013 education conference) to San Francisco (the National Association of Realtors) and back to Orlando (Press Ganey Associates, a health-care firm). Her 2014 calendar is starting to fill up, too, with a January booking before the National Automobile Dealers Association.      Both Democratic and Republican operatives said the strategy is smart for Clinton, so long as she avoids controversial groups and focuses on nonpolitical and often business-friendly audiences.      Clinton has addressed events aimed at both Democrats and Republicans, according to event organizers. When she was the keynote speaker a June gala for the Economic Club of Grand Rapids, one of the evening’s honorees was Amway President Doug DeVos, a prominent Republican whose family has given tens of millions of dollars to conservative causes.      In May, Clinton was introduced by former Nixon secretary of state Henry Kissinger at an Atlantic Council black-tie gala in Washington. Council President Frederick Kempe said Kissinger “brought down the house when he alluded to her future presidential possibilities.”      Former congresswoman Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Calif.), a Clinton friend and Atlantic Council leader, said: “It was a huge, blowout event. . . . There were so many people inside the Ritz-Carlton that you couldn’t move.”      Clinton’s speaking schedule illustrates her deep network of contacts across industries. She agreed to give a paid speech to the American Society for Clinical Pathology in Chicago this September in part, organizers said, because of the group’s work with the Clinton Global Initiative, her family’s charitable organization.      Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), a former aide to her husband, will introduce Clinton, and E. Blair Holladay, the group’s executive vice president, will ask her questions from the stage. Holladay said Clinton’s fee, which he would not disclose, will be covered by event sponsors, including some pharmaceutical companies.      Holladay noted that when Bill Clinton addressed the group’s convention in 2011, he requested a spread of vegan food backstage. “I haven’t gotten any specific requests from Hillary,” he said.      Presidential assumptions      One of the first groups to book Clinton was the relatively low-profile Pacific Council on International Policy, which awarded her its inaugural Warren Christopher Public Service Award. The council’s co-chairman is Kantor, who served along with Christopher in Bill Clinton’s Cabinet.      “I called her and there was not much hesitation whatsoever in accepting,” Kantor said, adding that she “took no fee at all.”      The former first lady’s staff picked the date, May 8, and gave organizers about six weeks to plan the gala at the luxurious Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif.      “We sold out relatively early,” Pacific Council President Jerrold D. Green said. “What we all assume is that she is running for president.”      Many of Clinton’s audiences assume the same.      In April, when Clinton appeared in front of the National Multi Housing Council, a trade group of apartment complex developers, she did not deliver a speech. Instead, organizers asked her to pose for pictures with the group’s executive council and answer questions on stage from the group’s chairman, Thomas S. Bozzuto, a Maryland developer.      “Naturally,” Bozzuto said, “she ducked my question when I asked her if she was going to run for president.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Sure, let me break it down for you. This story is about a woman named Mrs. Clinton. You might also know her as Hillary Clinton. She used to be the Secretary of State, which means she did a lot of important work helping to look after our country, especially in dealing with other countries around the world. Now, she's not doing that job anymore, but she's still really busy.  Mrs. Clinton travels all around the country giving speeches to different groups of people. These people are usually doing special jobs like managing companies or developing houses. They all love to hear her talk because she's very smart and has lots of experience. Some people think she gets paid a lot of money for these speeches. At the same time, there are people keeping an eye on where Mrs. Clinton is going and what she's saying. They're interested because they think she might want to be the President of our country in the future. This is a really big job and a lot of people want to know if she's planning to do it. There are also polls, which are like little quizzes where lots of people tell you what they think about something. These polls say that many people like Mrs. Clinton and would like her to be our president. But there are other people that might also want to be president, like Mr. Christie, Mr. Paul, and Mr. Biden. The polls are trying to figure out who people might choose. For the most part, Mrs. Clinton spends her time delivering speeches, writing a book about her experiences, and helping out at the organization that her husband started, which is called the Clinton Foundation.

It usually wouldn't bother him on ordinary days, but today was different. He had a critical presentation due in the morning, and he needed absolute concentration and peace for that. Not to mention, this wasn't the first time the squeaky bed frame invaded his ears and attempted to disrupt his peace of mind. On multiple occasions in the past, he tried to overlook and ignore it, but tonight, the situation was more pressing.  With a sigh of annoyance, he tried to bear it for a few more minutes, hoping against all hope that the noise would subside on its own accord or Joel would realize it without any prompt. His hopes fell flat, and it spurred a sense of desperation and resentment in him. He knew he had to intervene and decided it was high time to address this issue.  Shaking off the irritation, he drew in a deep breath, readying himself for the upcoming confrontation. Aware of the consequences that his reaction might result in, he made sure to compose himself and choose his words carefully. Clenching his fists, he rose from his chair, determination etching prominent lines on his forehead. His feet dragged across the floor, carrying him close to the shared wall. Frustration merged with his desperation to sleep peacefully as he raised his voice just loud enough for Joel to listen, trying to penetrate the thin wall with his resonant voice.  This was uncharted territory for him, as he usually prefered to avoid conflicts but the circumstances called out for direct action, pushing him out of his comfort zone.

Step 1: Understand the infield fly rule The infield fly rule is a rule in baseball and softball that is designed to prevent the defense from deliberately taking advantage of the baserunners, particularly when there is a potential for a double play. When the rule comes into effect, the batter is automatically out, regardless of whether the fielder catches the ball or not. Step 2: List the conditions required for the infield fly rule to come into effect The infield fly rule comes into effect when all of the following conditions are met: 1. There are fewer than two outs in the inning. 2. There are runners on first and second base, or bases loaded (runners on first, second, and third base). 3. The batter hits a fair ball that can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort, meaning it is neither a line drive nor a bunt. Step 3: Summarize the answer The infield fly rule comes into effect when there are fewer than two outs, runners on at least first and second base, and the batter hits a fair ball that can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On November 30, 1928, whilst on tour in Cleveland, Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms \\"a severe nervous crisis\\" and Sudhalter and Evans suggest \\"was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens\\", presumably triggered by Beiderbecke's attempt to curb his alcohol intake. \\"He cracked up, that's all\\", trombonist Bill Rank said. \\"Just went to pieces; broke up a roomful of furniture in the hotel.\\"In February 1929, Beiderbecke returned home to Davenport to convalesce and was hailed by the local press as \\"the world's hottest cornetist\\". He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto...

Which do you think the average person would know more/less about: Iranian cinema or Iranian football? Interestingly, the two come to the forefront of controversial Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's latest film entitled 'Offside', a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one's right to do something or go somewhere and an individual's right to extend that courtesy if and when they'd like to. The odd thing is, you don't come away from Offside having learnt about Iranian football or too much about Iranian cinema (unless it's an education in Panahi's controversial style), but you do come away feeling enlightened, that at least someone from Iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like Iran, and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it. I can remember the 2006 World Cup, I'm sure many people can. It was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year, a summer of World Cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic. Needless to say, I saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in Spain '82 when it was thought West Germany and Austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of Algeria. Anyone in Britain that was watching the BBC's broadcast of the Iran  Mexico game, both nations' first of the tournament, may remember that at the top of the show, the BBC's football anchorman Gary Lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match. It went something like: 'We've seen giants Germany, England, Argentina and Holland play but now we get to see.........Mexico and Iran battle it out'. The emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore. It's a shame because there are people, and films like Offside present them, who are really willing to see Iran play to the point where they risk their well-being to achieve it and it's sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem 'inferior' when there are others who'd do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage. When immediately thinking of the words 'Iran', 'football' and 'World Cup', my mind flies back to the France '98 game between said nation and America. Here is a film about a World Cup game of sorts involving Iran but where some or indeed most Iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around Iran's famous victory over The United States and what that meant to them, director Panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude. You can imagine a heavy handed film detailing Iran's 'victory' as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they 'defeat' a Western power or 'enemy' at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in. A couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 Indian film 'Lagaan', in which the Indian peasants defeat the ruling British at cricket. Similalry, 2005's 'The Game of Their Lives' sees the Americans defeat the English at a football match only this time in the 1950 World Cup. The differences between these films and Offside are immense; Offside is looking at a situation behind a state's mentality and dares to explore an essence of Feminism as the girls, trying to see their beloved Iran defeat Bahrain and qualify for the World Cup, are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game. The reasoning is to do with the foul language the men 'may', not will, but 'may' use during the game. The film presents Iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man's right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman's right to see the game all together  it is no wonder Panahi's film was itself banned in Iran. But Panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones, two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body/mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match. Panahi pays special attention to the title of his film 'Offside' which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an 'attacker' is 'caught' trying to gain an advantage in the field of play. The parallels run with the womens' position in the film as these advancing (supposedly without right) individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team; that being the state itself. I think Offside is one of the better films to come out of the Middle East and surrounding Gulf area that I've seen. It's a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the IMDb and thus, the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo-realist aura to it all. The immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong-doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful. I also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons I've mentioned shows a distinct level of callous, either that or you work in the Iranian government. Choose your answer.

We used to talk about stuffs as a part of casual conversation and somewhat he seemed like a good person. But lately all he can talk about is sex. Yes! he playfully asks sometimes why I am single for which I clearly don't know the answer. But it got worst. All he can talk about when we see each other is about his sex life and how I am missing out all the fun. Whenever he talks about this stuff as a virgin IDK anything else to talk about it. I just add a comment to it. So basically I started ignoring him. He always checks out girls passing by and comments on them in a sexual manner. One day he will find out that I am avoiding him.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. An owl hunts mice that live in a farmer's field. After the farmer gathers the crops, the mice have fewer places to hide. Which is most likely to happen after the crops are gathered? Pick the answer from these options","output":"Unfortunately, the options to choose from are not provided in your question. Nonetheless, I can still provide you with a detailed answer about the scenario you've presented. After the farmer gathers the crops, the mice will have fewer places to hide. This change in the environment affects both the mice and the owl that rely on the field for survival. In situations like this, several outcomes are possible: 1. The owl's hunting efficiency increases: As the mice lose their hiding spots, it becomes easier for the owl to spot, catch, and eat them. This leads to the owl being more effective as a predator and potentially catching more mice than it did before the crops were harvested. 2. The mice population may initially decrease: As the owl's hunting efficiency increases, the mice population could initially decline. Fewer hiding places make it difficult for the mice to escape predators, and as a result, their numbers might diminish. 3. Adaptation in the mice behavior and habitat: Over time, the mice may learn to adapt to the new environment. They could change their behavior – for example, becoming more nocturnal – or move to other nearby areas offering better hiding spots and resources. This can help them avoid predation and maintain their population. 4. The owl might change its hunting strategy or behavior: If the owl's primary food source becomes scarce due to a decline in the mice population or a shift in the mice's habits or habitat, the owl may need to find other food sources or change its hunting strategy. Owls are adaptable predators, and they might also start hunting in different locations or move their territory in search of more abundant prey. 5. Balance in the ecosystem: Over time, the ecosystem may reach a new balance. As the organisms involved (the owl and mice in this case) adapt to the changes in the environment, they may find a new equilibrium that allows both populations to coexist. If the mice were overpopulating the field before the crops were gathered, the increased hunting efficiency of the owl might help to maintain a healthier balance between predators and prey. In conclusion, after the farmer gathers the crops, and the mice have fewer places to hide, the most likely outcome is that the owl's hunting efficiency will increase, leading to a potential initial decrease in the mice population. However, various adaptations and adjustments in both the owl's and the mice's behavior could help maintain a balanced ecosystem in the long term."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this equation: 760 * y + 1664 = 696 * y Imagine you have 760 jellybeans times some number y and 1664 candies on one side. On the other side, you have 696 jellybeans times the same number y. To find out how many jellybeans are in y, we need to move all the jellybeans to one side.  So, let's take away 696 jellybeans multiplied by y from both sides. This will help us know how many more jellybeans we have. 760y - 696y + 1664 = 696y - 696y When you take away 696 jellybeans times y from both sides, you will have: 64y + 1664 = 0 Now, it looks like this: you have 64 jellybeans times y plus 1664 candies equals zero. Let's find out how many jellybeans are in y. To do that, we need to move the candies to the other side. So, we take away 1664 candies from both sides: 64y = -1664 Now we only have 64 jellybeans times y on one side equals negative 1664 candies. We're close!  Last step is to find out what y is by dividing both sides by 64: y = -1664 ÷ 64 Now, after doing this division, we find out: y = -26 So, our special number y is -26, which means minus 26.

He flies the world in a blood-red private jet, has an access-all-areas Formula 1 pass worth a cool £1 million and is fresh from the red carpet at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards, resplendent in a solid gold chain worthy of a superstar rapper. And like most A-listers, this particular star is not without a few unpleasant habits. Support staff at the BBC awards can attest as much, having been tasked with picking up after him. Welcome to the world of Roscoe Hamilton, a two-year-old bulldog who lives a life of absurd luxury. Scroll down for video. Roscoe (centre) lounges about while on holiday with Lewis Hamilton and his other dog, bulldog bitch Coco. As the adored pet of Lewis Hamilton, reigning Formula 1 world champion, his is an existence of five-star pampering. Home is a £10 million apartment in Monaco, which he shares with Hamilton, his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger and a bulldog bitch called Coco. Yet there is no question who rules the roost. Since padding into Lewis’s life in February 2013, Roscoe has taken centre stage. Take the family’s sleeping arrangements. Hamilton may be dating one of the most desired women on the planet in Nicole, but when the day ends, it is Roscoe who snuggles between the Egyptian cotton sheets alongside his master. (Ms Scherzinger is based for much of the year in America.) And as the racing driver jets between the U.S. and Europe in that gleaming £20 million Bombardier CL-600, he does so with Roscoe sitting beside him on his personal cream leather seat. Double act: The pair together at last night's BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. Indeed, Roscoe has his own passport as well as that pass to the Formula 1 paddock, which was given to him by Bernie Ecclestone, the billionaire overlord of the sport. Sponsors pay upwards of £1 million for these passes, yet Roscoe’s, which features a photograph of the bulldog in a pair of expensive Beats headphones, was a gift. While many people were nonplussed to see a celebrity turning up to the televised awards with his pet, to those who know Hamilton well it was no surprise to see the pooch waddling along the red carpet on Sunday night, complete with gold chain. Hamilton was wearing this jewellery at some of his public appearances towards the end of the Formula 1 season, and is happy to share his substantial worldly goods with his dog. This is a fastidious professional who obsesses over the tiniest detail to give him a racing advantage. Yet he allows Roscoe to play with his race helmet as if it was a toy ball. And this is no ordinary piece of kit. It takes three days to make one and they cost £3,300 apiece. That said, they are designed to withstand 800c flames and huge impacts, so an encounter with an enthusiastic bulldog is unlikely to cause too much of a problem. The helmet is adorned with an image of Hamilton with Nicole and — you guessed it — Roscoe. The extent of the driver’s canine infatuation has ruffled feathers, however, with questions raised about whether it is appropriate to allow a dog into the racing paddock. Legendary commentator Murray Walker did not mince his words: ‘I have the utmost respect and admiration for Lewis, but the F1 paddock is no place for a dog. Think of the safety reasons. Think, too, of how a dog’s hearing system is infinitely more sensitive than a human’s — and my hearing has been destroyed by F1 cars. I am utterly amazed he’s allowed to take the dog in. I can’t imagine what the hell they are thinking about. It’s madness.’ All of which presented a dilemma for Hamilton’s racing team, Mercedes. By that point, Roscoe had his own bespoke canine racing suit, while Lewis spent £220,000 on hiring a luxury motor home for the European season — because the hotels frequented by the Formula 1 hierarchy do not allow dogs. Some race tracks, seduced by the glamour of the driver and his designer dog, use them as an advertising tool. For the Silverstone Grand Prix, the organisers provided Roscoe with a bespoke timber kennel, with his name over the door and a personalised cap. Roscoe, however, does not sleep in a kennel. And when his master is otherwise disposed, only the very best treatment will do. The X Factor: A friendly nuzzle for Lewis's girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. The singer spends half the year in America - leaving a space in the couple's bed for Roscoe to slip between the Egyptian cotton sheets. High flyers: UK-bound with Roscoe (left), Coco (centre) and Lewis Hamilton on board a private jet. Marie-Pierre Hansom, senior ‘host’ at Mercedes-Benz World in Surrey — the carmaker’s flagship centre — was left in no doubt about this earlier this year. Accustomed to dealing with the biggest star names, she was taken aback by what happened when the driver arrived to film a commercial. With Lewis fed, watered, made up and safely installed on set, she was settling down for a cup of coffee when the phone rang. ‘It was our reception desk advising me that two of his guests had arrived on site,’ she says. ‘Most of the entourage were here by then, so I thought: “Who could it be?” What's up, dawg: In Beats headphones. The two-year-old bulldog even has his own pass to the Formula 1 paddock. ‘I went to introduce myself and I’m faced with two little bulldogs. Panic inside, we don’t allow dogs in the building, what am I going to do? I need to move them pretty quickly. ‘I make it to the suite, get them set up very quickly. They need water, they need food, they need cushions. They had to be taken for various things such as comfort breaks. We even had to call the cleaning team for help at one point, because I don’t deal with things like that. I started the day expecting one celebrity. I finished it with three. ‘I hope I made them happy, and by the snores coming out of Roscoe I think they all had a good time.’ Since arriving in Hamilton’s life, Roscoe has become a social media star. There is footage of him in Lewis’s bed, on aircraft and even on a trip to a bowling alley. Hamilton, who doesn’t have children, is fond of dressing up his beloved dog in designer hats, headphones and jewellery. He also brings along Roscoe to interviews (on one occasion having to apologise when the mutt’s loud snoring drowned out his answers). Yet it’s plain Roscoe has fulfilled an important role in his master’s life. Raised in the rarefied atmosphere of motor racing, anointed as the chosen one since his teens, it is hardly surprising Hamilton is not the most worldly of individuals. Blessed — or cursed — with a prickliness particular to the uber-competitive, he clearly takes great comfort from the unquestioning adoration of his dogs. Roscoe was joined last year by the bulldog bitch Coco, yet she has been comparatively anonymous, due in part to health problems. She has had to undergo two tricky operations to treat a problem with her tongue, so by and large Roscoe has travelled with Lewis while she stayed at home. Lewis grew up with pet labradors, though, so why a bulldog? The answer may lie in his controversial relationship with his nationality. Playtime: Making friends with Lewis's nephew, Kalden, when Hamilton spent a day with his mother and sister. Roscoe  has his own passport and for the Silverstone Grand Prix, the organisers provided Roscoe with a bespoke timber kennel, with his name over the door and a personalised cap. In his acceptance speech after winning Sports Personality of the Year on Sunday night, much was made of his pride in his British heritage. Yet this is a man who, the moment the big bucks started rolling in, decamped to Switzerland and then Monaco as a tax exile. Twitter immediately lit up with outraged comments about the BBC’s sporting champion not even paying a licence fee. He may believe that by having a British bulldog by his side, the public will subconsciously associate him with all things patriotic. But perhaps not when the dog is Roscoe Hamilton, surely the most pampered ‘non-dom’ in the canine world.

Jason Leonard  (born 14 August 1968) is an English former rugby union player, and has been the president of the Rugby Football Union since 2015. Nicknamed The Fun Bus, Leonard was a prop forward who won 114 caps for England and five for the British and Irish Lions. His total of 119 was a world record until 2006, when it was surpassed by George Gregan. Leonard played in England teams which won four Grand Slams (1991, 1992, 1995 and 2003) and the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and was part of the British and Irish Lions squad that won the test series during their 1997 tour of South Africa. With Dick Best no longer England head coach, the RFU appointed well-known and highly successful Bath coach Jack Rowell as his replacement. There was much speculation amongst many established England players as to what changes the new coach would bring to the England setup, particularly one with such close ties to a successful Bath Rugby Club. Rowell claimed he would rid England of the cautious, forward-dominated 10-man game which had done so well for them earlier in the decade, and play running rugby more similar to Bath's. Leonard kept his place in the England team, which now included several new players such as Mike Catt, Ben Clarke, Victor Ubogu, Steve Ojomoh (all Bath players) and Tim Rodber. In the 1995 Five Nations, Leonard won a record (for a prop) 38th cap for England, playing against Scotland, and the victory meant his third Grand Slam.  England held high hopes for the upcoming Rugby World Cup in South Africa. At the World Cup, England were drawn in Pool B, generally regarded as one of the easier groups in the competition. However, England experienced setbacks, gaining only narrow victories over Argentina (24-18) and Italy (27-20). In England's final pool match against Western Samoa, Leonard was rested and his record of 40 consecutive England caps ended. England won that match 44-22 and also won the subsequent quarter-final against Australia 25-22, before losing the semi-final to New Zealand 29-45 and finishing the tournament in fourth place.  In November 1996, Leonard skippered England for the first time, against Argentina at Twickenham. The game was very close, with Argentina taking a narrow lead close to full-time. From a rolling maul, Leonard scored a try to level the scores, and a Mike Catt penalty won the game 20-18. The try remains Leonard's only score for England.  In the 1996-1997 season, Leonard began to play for England at tighthead prop (number 3) to make room for Leicester Tigers loosehead prop (number 1), Graham Rowntree, and in 1997, Leonard was selected for his second British and Irish Lions tour, this time to South Africa.  In September 1997, the RFU appointed Clive Woodward as head coach. The Autumn internationals saw England playing Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Against Australia, Leonard found himself selected at loosehead prop again, with Wasps' Will Green winning his first cap at tighthead. For the remaining two tests, Leonard was moved back to tighthead. The ability to scrummage effectively on either side of the scrum proved to be one of Leonard's great assets. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Why did they hold high hopes?","output":"England held high hopes for the upcoming Rugby World Cup in South Africa because they had won their third Grand Slam in the 1995 Five Nations tournament, which showed that they had a strong and successful team."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Nurmi was born in Turku, Finland, to carpenter Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. Nurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that \\"this is absolutely my last season on the track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it.\\" However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15 km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin. Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945. In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn. He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile. Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925, and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him. In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20 km. In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles. He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes. Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he \\"won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event.\\"  In April 1932, the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation. The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing, but agreed to launch an investigation. It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch, and the Associated Press wrote that \\"there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question.\\" A week later, the Finnish Athletics Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi, finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism. Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games.  On 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials. Not drinking a drop of liquid, he ran the old-style 'short marathon' of 40.2 km (25 miles) in 2:22:03.8 -- on the pace to finish in about 2:29:00, just under Albert Michelsen's marathon world record of 2:29:01.8. At the time, he led Armas Toivonen, the eventual Olympic bronze medalist, by six minutes. Nurmi's time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon. Confident that he had done enough, Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon. The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10,000 m and the marathon. The Guardian reported that \\"some of his trial times were almost unbelievable,\\" and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury. Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War. Did he win this marathon?","output":"The article does not explicitly mention if Paavo Nurmi won the marathon at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. However, it does provide some information about his preparations and intentions for the marathon. Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... Question: What is probably true about Kwon Hyuk-Chul? Options: - He has spent a lot of time around nuclear warheads.   - He has spent a lot of time with Donald Trump.   - not enough information   - He has spent a lot of time doing research. === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"He has spent a lot of time doing research. Kwon Hyuk-Chul is a professor of security strategy at Kookmin University. The fact that he conducted a study to estimate the cost of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID) for North Korea, as mentioned in the passage, suggests that he has spent a significant amount of time doing research in the field of nuclear disarmament and security strategy. There is no indication in the passage that he has spent much time around nuclear warheads or with Donald Trump."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,... Why is there most likely support for Pres. Trump's tariffs? - Steel plants will prosper - not enough information - Other businesses will prosper - It will keep American jobs The answer to this question is:","output":"There is most likely support for President Trump's tariffs because: 1. Steel plants will prosper: The tariffs aim to protect the domestic steel and aluminum industries, which have been struggling in recent years. Higher tariffs on imported steel and aluminum can make American-made products more competitive, potentially leading to increased production and profitability for U.S. steel plants. 2. It will keep American jobs: Supporters of the tariffs argue that protecting the domestic steel and aluminum industries can help preserve and even create jobs in these sectors. Some politicians, particularly Democrats from states with a strong manufacturing presence, believe that taking action against foreign competition is essential to protect American workers and preserve the long-term health of the U.S. manufacturing sector. 3. Concerns about foreign trade practices: Advocates for the tariffs also argue that other countries, particularly China, have been unfairly subsidizing their steel and aluminum industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. The tariffs are seen as a way to level the playing field and address these trade imbalances. Although there is support for the tariffs, there is also significant criticism and concerns about potential negative consequences, such as triggering a trade war and hurting U.S. businesses in other industries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Conacher was born in Toronto, Ontario on May 24, 1900. His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British troops were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters. Conacher scored the first goal in Pirates history on American Thanksgiving Day Thursday November 26, 1925, against the Boston Bruins. He scored nine goals in 33 games in 1925-26, then returned to Toronto to play professional baseball with the Toronto Maple Leafs. An outfielder on the team, Conacher and the Maple Leafs won the International League championship then defeated the Louisville Colonels to win the Little World Series.  He returned to Pittsburgh for the 1926-27 NHL season, but was dealt early in the year to the New York Americans in exchange for Charlie Langlois and 2,000. The trade nearly proved disastrous for Conacher. He scored 8 goals in 1926-27 and improved to 11 in 1927-28, but playing for a team owned by notorious bootlegger Bill Dwyer resulted in his becoming a heavy drinker. Conacher served as player-coach in 1929-30, but his play and health had deteriorated. Two events in that off-season saved Conacher: he swore off alcohol completely upon the birth of his first child, and his playing rights were sold to the Montreal Maroons.  Conacher periodically struggled with Montreal, and at one point was placed on waivers with no other team willing to take over his contract. Nonetheless, his overall play and point totals increased for three consecutive seasons with the Maroons, peaking at 28 points in 1932-33. He was named to the Second All-Star Team that season, but was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in exchange for Teddy Graham. Conacher was a key figure in the club's first-ever Stanley Cup victory that season. He finished second to the Canadiens' Aurel Joliat in the voting for the Hart Trophy and earned a spot on the NHL's First All-Star Team.  On Wednesday October 3, 1934, Conacher was involved in one of the largest transactions in league history. He was dealt to the Montreal Canadiens, along with Leroy Goldsworthy and Roger Jenkins in exchange for Montreal superstar Howie Morenz, Lorne Chabot and Marty Burke. The deal was only part of a series of trades involving four teams that represented one of the biggest deals in NHL history. Immediately following the Chicago trade, Conacher was sent back to the Maroons, along with Herb Cain, in exchange for the rights to Nelson Crutchfield. Conacher spent his last three NHL seasons with the Maroons and won his second Stanley Cup in 1935. He ended his hockey career after the team was eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Rangers on April 23, 1937. That final year he was runner-up to Babe Siebert in the 1937 Hart Trophy voting and was placed on the NHL Second All-Star Team. Did he win any championships?","output":"Yes, Lionel Conacher won multiple championships throughout his career. As a professional baseball player, he won the International League championship and the Little World Series with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In his hockey career, Conacher won two Stanley Cup titles: one with the Chicago Black Hawks in the 1933-34 season and another with the Montreal Maroons in 1935. Additionally, he earned several individual accolades, such as being named to the NHL First and Second All-Star Teams and being a runner-up for the Hart Trophy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Problem:In this darkly humorous thriller, James Caan portrays Romantic novelist Paul Sheldon, famously renowned for his trademark character, the film's namesake 'Misery' Chastaine. shortly after finishing his latest book, he drives of back to New York from the Silver Creek lodge. After a while, his car swerves off the icy road in a blizzard. In the car, he has a flashback in which he is talking to his agent (portrayed by Lauren Bacall) about his last Misery book. He is rescued by nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) who takes him back to her house for two days and reveales that she is his number one fan, hence the infamous quote \\"I'm your number one fan\\". When Annie asks if she can read his new book (in manuscript form) she proves to be more than a little eccentric when she lashes out in a fit of rage over the swearing in his book. When she leaves the room he seems fraked out and looks like he wants to leave quickly. The next day, Annie brings home a copy of the final Misery book and over the days reveals how many pages she has read. During which, she introuces him to her pet sow, Misery.The following night, she nearly kills him over the fact that he has killed Misery in his final book, tells him that she never called the local hospital (which she said she had) and threatens to kill him if anything happens to her. He immediately tries to escape but fails. The next day, Annie seems happy and tries to persuade him to burn the manuscript to which he seems reluctant. Later, she reveals she wants him to write a new book in which Misery comes back to life. When he sees a hairpin on the floor, he has an idea to buy time, he asks Annie to buy some different paper because his current paper smudges, to which she responds with another fit of rage. Whilst she is out shopping, Paul uses the hairpin to unlock his bedroom door and escape. However, he soon finds out that the front door is locked as well. He makes a visit to her living room and medicine closet. In the living room he accidentally knocks a small ceramic penguin off the table and puts it back the wrong way (this will become important later). He also realises that Annie's phone is a fake one, cancelling his chances of contacting the outside world. In the medicine closet, he takes some of the pills the Annie had been giving him for his fracture. He also tries to escape through her back door in the kitchen but cannot open it (I forgot to mention that he was bedridden for a few days and currently in a wheelchair). Soon, he hears Annie returning and immediately races back to his room. Fortunately, he gets back to his room in time just when she opens the door. She gets him back into bed and gives him a notepad and his pills (which he pretends to swallow).The following night, he saves up a lot of powder from the pills. In the morning, an argument starts between Paul and Annie about the book, which escalates into a humorous fit of rage about her growing up in Bakersfield watching chapter plays. Meanwhile, the local authorities find Sheldon's '65 Mustang buried in the snow. When Annie reads some of Paul's new manuscript she responds happily. Paul requsts that Annie have dinner with him to celebrate Misery's return. At the dinner, Paul makes a toast to Misery's return but asks if she has any candles. Whilst Annie is looking for them, Paul puts the powder in her wine. When she returns she almost makes the toast but drops her drink in the process, ruining Paul's plan.The next scene shows a line of clips of Paul writing the book. In the last clip, Annie gives him his pills and talks about committing suicide. When she leaves the house, he goes out of his room again and reads her scrapbook. It includes many newspaper clippings, revealing that she killed her father, her college roommate and many patients in hospitals. He grabs a knife from the kitchen and wheels himself to his room. Later, he awakens to the sight of Annie as she forcibly sedates him. In the morning, she ties him to the bed and reveals that she knows that he has been out of his room (the scrapbook, the ceramic penguin, the hairpin). Then, she 'hobbles' him (puts a block of wood betwen his feet and hits them with a sledgehammer)In the next scene, 'Buster' the local sheriff sees an emotional outburst in the town and researches her history. Later, he pays a visit to her house to look around. When he leaves, he hears a noise and goes back inside to find Paul in the basement and is shot by Annie. When she says she wants to kill him then herself, he requests finishing the book first. later, he is writing the book and requests 3 things: a cigarette, matches, and Dom Perignon champagne. When Annie returns, he also requests two glasses. whilst she is out of the room, he pours flammable liquid onto the manuscript and burns it, which escalates into a brawl resulting in Annie's death.18 months later, Paul is seen in a restaurant with his agent, refusing to write a book about his experiences.

These so-called green schools use less energy, cost less to run and are good for students. The newly renovated   Sidwell Friends Middle School in the District has been awarded the highest rating by the U.S. Green Building Council for having a positive impact on the environment-a rare honor. Soon the school will treat and re-use its wastewater, saving hundreds of thousands of gallons of water per year. The recycled water from sinks and toilets, which can't be used for drinking, will be color1ed blue, \\"so we know it's recycled, just in case it gets into the water fountains  -not that it would,\\" joked Emily Bernstein, 14, a Sidwell student and building tour guide. Water fountains will still use fresh city water. Sidwell students are studying the building itself in science classes to help them learn first-hand the positive impact of green buildings. It's affecting how they view the world around them. \\"If you see a [building] being torn down, you think, 'They're going to fill up a whole landfill   with that,'\\" said Matthew Malone, 13.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Whether or not a given isotope is radioactive is a characteristic of that particular isotope. Some isotopes are stable indefinitely, while others are radioactive and decay through a characteristic form of emission. As time passes, less and less of the radioactive isotope will be present, and the level of radioactivity decreases. An interesting and useful aspect of radioactive decay is half-life, which is the amount of time it takes for one-half of a radioactive isotope to decay. The half-life of a specific radioactive isotope is constant; it is unaffected by conditions and is independent of the initial amount of that isotope. Consider the following example. Suppose we have 100.0 g of tritium (a radioactive isotope of hydrogen). It has a half-life of 12.3 y. After 12.3 y, half of the sample will have decayed from hydrogen-3 to helium-3 by emitting a beta particle, so that only 50.0 g of the original tritium remains. After another 12.3 y— making a total of 24.6 y—another half of the remaining tritium will have decayed, leaving 25.0 g of tritium. After another 12.3 y—now a total of 36.9 y—another half of the remaining tritium will have decayed, leaving 12.5 g. This sequence of events is illustrated in Figure 15.1 \\"Radioactive Decay\\".

Question: Combine facts and answer this: Which country was a British-born aviator for whom a movie starring Trevor Eve was based on fly as one of the first bush pilots in? Answer:","output":"The country we are talking about is Australia. The British-born aviator referred to is Sidney Cotton. Sidney Cotton was a renowned figure in the aviation world for a number of reasons. Born in 1894 in Sussex, United Kingdom, he was not only a pioneer aviator but also an inventor, particularly gaining fame in the realm of aerial photography. The interesting thing about Sidney Cotton is that while he was British by birth, he spent a significant portion of his life in Australia. He initially moved there in 1911, involved in the early development of the Australian cotton industry. Eventually, he developed a keen interest in aviation and would go on to join the Royal Naval Air Service and British Royal Air Force during World War I. However, where his Australian adventures considerably stand out are his experiences as one of the first bush pilots in the country. Australian Bush flying refers to aircraft operations carried out in the bush. Bush flying involves operations in rough terrains where there are often no prepared landing strips or runways, frequently necessitating that bush planes are equipped with abnormally large tires, floats or skis. Cotton spent a significant period of his life flying over the outback of Australia, which significantly added to his fame and led him to be categorized as an integral figure in early Australian aviation. This exciting life of Sidney Cotton, his adventures, and contributions were not just limited to documentation and history books, but like many compelling narratives, they also found their way in the domain of cinema. A TV-movie named \\"Shooting The Past\\" was released in 1999 where Trevor Eve, a known British actor, played the role of Sidney Cotton. The plot of the movie is loosely based on his life as a spy and his innovations in the area of aerial reconnaissance photography. Therefore, to answer the query, the country in which the British-born aviator, for whom a movie starring Trevor Eve was based on, flew as one of the first bush pilots is Australia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rafael Edward Cruz (; born December 22, 1970) is an American politician and attorney serving as the junior United States Senator from Texas since 2013. He was a candidate for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election. Cruz was raised in Houston, Texas. After high school, he attended and graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. Cruz's victory in the Republican primary was described by the Washington Post as \\"the biggest upset of 2012 ... a true grassroots victory against very long odds\\". On January 19, 2011, after U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said she would not seek re-election, Cruz announced his candidacy via a blogger conference call. In the Republican senatorial primary, Cruz ran against sitting Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Cruz was endorsed first by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and then by the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative political action committee; Erick Erickson, former editor of prominent conservative blog RedState; the FreedomWorks for America super PAC; nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin; Tea Party Express; Young Conservatives of Texas; and U.S. Senators Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint, Mike Lee, Rand Paul and Pat Toomey. He was also endorsed by former Texas Congressman Ron Paul, George P. Bush, and former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum. Former Attorney General Edwin Meese served as national chairman of Cruz's campaign.  Cruz won the runoff for the Republican nomination with a 14-point margin over Dewhurst. Cruz defeated Dewhurst despite being outspent by Dewhurst who held a statewide elected office. Dewhurst spent 19 million and Cruz spent only 7 million. Dewhurst raised over 30 million and outspent Cruz at a ratio of nearly 3-to-1.  In the November 6 general election, Cruz faced Democratic candidate Paul Sadler, an attorney and a former state representative from Henderson, in east Texas. Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote. According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of the Hispanic vote, vs. 60% for Sadler, outperforming Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney with the Hispanic vote in Texas.  After Time magazine reported on a potential violation of ethics rules by failing to publicly disclose his financial relationship with Caribbean Equity Partners Investment Holdings during the 2012 campaign, Cruz called his failure to disclose these connections an inadvertent omission.  In January 2016, The New York Times reported that Cruz and his wife had taken out low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs (where she worked) and Citibank, and failed to report the nearly 1 million in loans on Federal Election Commission disclosure statements as required by law. Cruz disclosed the loans on his Senate financial disclosure forms in July 2012, but not on the Federal Election Commission form. There is no indication that Cruz's wife had any role in providing any of the loans, or that the banks did anything wrong. The loans were largely repaid by later campaign fundraising. A spokesperson for Cruz said his failure to report the loans to the FEC was \\"inadvertent\\" and said he would be filing supplementary paperwork. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What are some notable aspects of the 2012 election?","output":"Some notable aspects of the 2012 election, particularly in relation to Rafael Edward Cruz's victory in the Republican primary, include: 1.

The digestive system is the body system that digests food. It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What does the digestive system do regarding waste?\\" is \\"It absorbs them\\"? Pick from:  a). no.  b). yes.","output":"a). no. The digestive system does not absorb waste.

How is \\"That concludes the explanations of vote.\\" said in Romanian?","output":"In Romanian, the phrase \\"That concludes the explanations of vote.\\" can be translated as \\"Aceasta încheie explicațiile votului.\\" To provide more context and understanding, here's a brief overview of the Romanian language and some details about the translation: Romanian is a Romance language, belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is spoken by approximately 24 million people as a native language, mainly in Romania and Moldova, and by another 4 million people as a second language. Regarding the translation: 1. \\"Aceasta\\" (This) - This word is a demonstrative pronoun that refers to something specific or previously mentioned within the context. In this case, it is used to indicate that whatever has been previously discussed or analyzed is now coming to an end. 2. \\"încheie\\" (concludes) - This verb is derived from the Romanian verb \\"a încheia,\\" which means \\"to conclude\\" or \\"to bring to an end.\\" In our translation, it is used in the third person singular form, showing that \\"Aceasta\\" (this) acts as the subject of the sentence. 3. \\"explicațiile\\" (the explanations) - This word originates from the verb \\"a explica\\" which means \\"to explain.\\" In this context, \\"explicațiile\\" is a plural noun that refers to the explanations that have been given before the statement is made. 4. \\"votului\\" (of vote) - The word \\"vot\\" means \\"vote\\" in English. In this context, it translates to \\"votului\\" as the noun is in the genitive case, indicating possession or a close relationship between the vote and its explanations. The \\"-ului\\" is a common genitive ending in Romanian for masculine nouns. So, when you put all these words together, you have \\"Aceasta încheie explicațiile votului,\\" which translates to \\"That concludes the explanations of vote\\" in English.

Based on the premise \\"For example, one point that is sometimes overlooked is that low personal saving has consequences for U.S. reliance on foreign borrowing, long-term economic growth, and standards of living for future generations.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"That low personal saving has no consequences for U.S\\" is true?","output":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"That low personal saving has no consequences for the U.S.,\\" let's break down the statement and consider the available evidence: Step 1: Understanding the premise The given premise states that low personal saving has consequences for the U.S. in terms of reliance on foreign borrowing, long-term economic growth, and standards of living for future generations. This implies that there are tangible effects of low personal saving on the U.S. economy and society. Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis The hypothesis claims that low personal saving has no consequences for the U.S., which contradicts the provided premise. To determine the validity of this hypothesis, we need to examine whether there's supporting evidence for the premise's claim. Step 3: Evaluating evidence for the premise There is considerable evidence which supports the claim made in the premise: - Low personal savings can lead to greater reliance on foreign borrowing as the country needs to finance its consumption and investments. This, in turn, can increase the national debt and potentially expose the U.S. to financial risks, such as currency fluctuations and high interest rates. - Long-term economic growth can be affected negatively by low personal savings, as it reduces the capital available for investment in businesses, infrastructure, and other essential areas of the economy. This can result in slower economic growth over time. - Finally, standards of living for future generations can suffer if there is a lack of personal savings. This is because low savings leave fewer resources available for investments in education, healthcare, and other essential aspects of social wellbeing. This can undermine the quality of life for future generations. Step 4: Revisiting the hypothesis The evidence outlined above contradicts the hypothesis stating that low personal saving has no consequences for the U.S. The premise provides a clear link between low personal saving and effects on foreign borrowing, long-term economic growth, and standards of living for future generations. Conclusion: Based on the examination of the evidence and the contradiction with the given premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"That low personal saving has no consequences for the U.S.\\" is not true."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Rivers are one of our most important natural resources . Many of the world's great cities are located on rivers, and almost every country has at least one river running through it that plays an important part in the lives of its people. Since the beginning of history, people have used rivers for transportation. The longest one in the United States is the Mississippi. The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile. To the people of India, the Ganges is great, but it is also important for transportation; ships can travel along it for a thousand miles. Other great rivers are the Congo in Africa and the Mekong in southeastern Asia. The greatest of all for navigation , however, is the Amazon in Brazil . It is so wide and so deep that large ships can go about two thousand miles up it. Besides transportation, rivers give food to eat, water to drink, water for crops, and chances for fun. In order to increase the supply  of water for crops, engineers sometimes build a dam  across a river and let a lake form behind the dam. Then people can use the water not only to irrigate  their fields but also to make electricity for their homes and industries. However, large cities and industries that are located on rivers often cause problems. As the cities grow in size and industries increase in number, the water in the rivers becomes polluted with chemicals and other materials. People are learning the importance, however, of doing more to keep their rivers clean if they want to enjoy the benefits of these natural resources.

Context: President Donald Trump is shifting his focus back to domestic issues after returning late Tuesday from a 12-day trip to Asia. This week, Trump will resume pressing congressional Republicans to pass a tax reform measure to follow through on one of his key campaign promises. Trump appears to be working closely with Republican congressional leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. \\"We ran in 2016 on doing this tax reform,\\" Ryan told reporters at the Capitol. \\"The president ran on doing this tax cut and tax reform. So this is about fulfilling our promises to the American people.\\"  However, since the president was last in the country, he and his Republican allies in Congress face a new political landscape in the wake of last week's gubernatorial election victories by Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey. In Virginia, exit polls showed that many voters were motivated primarily by their opposition to the president. \\"The fact that the president is so polarizing and so unpopular with approval ratings generally under about 40 percent, and Democrats are going to be extra-motivated to come out,\\" said University of Virginia political analyst Kyle Kondik. Kondik said the strong Democratic showing in statewide races in Virginia last week was the best non-presidential election showing for the party since 2006, the last time Democrats nationally won control of the House of Representatives. Many Democrats believe a focus on Trump could help them retake control of the House next year. \\"You can sort of smell when a wave is beginning, no guarantee it continues, but it is likely to,\\" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \\"And that smell that was in the air in 2005 is in the air now.\\" Trump's approval ratings remain historically low for a first-year president — with several recent polls showing him below 40 percent — which could be a warning sign for Republicans ahead of next year's elections.  \\"If the president is where he is today, I think that is going to be very difficult for the party to even hold the House of...

Dashcam video captures toddler running down Oregon highway Footage released by a US sheriff’s office has shown the terrifying moment a toddler appeared on a busy highway, running directly into oncoming traffic. The dashcam video, posted to Oregon’s Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page today and narrated by Lieutenant Curtis Landers, has already received more than 26,000 views, 350 likes and 520 shares. Rendered in night vision black-and-white, the video shows the ghostly figure of a two-year-old child racing down a highway identified as US Route 101. Upon sighting the child, the driver – a local deputy – immediately pulls up, emerging from the cabin and bending to scoop the oblivious child up before they can come to harm. The toddler had reportedly escaped from a nearby community centre while their family was preoccupied cleaning up, following a gathering. The incident was deemed by police to be accidental and no criminal charges brought against any of those involved. The video caption states the purpose behind sharing the video was to raise awareness about “the dangers of distracted driving”.

Humanism Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory and B. F. Skinner's Behaviorism. The approach emphasizes an individual's inherent drive towards self-actualization and creativity. Psychologists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow introduced a positive, humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s. Other sources include the philosophies of existentialism and phenomenology.

Carrie Fisher to haters: Youth and beauty are not accomplishments The first “Star Wars” installment in a decade has largely been met with jubilation, not least because Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher have reprised their classic roles as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess — ahem, General — Leia. Yet some longtime fans were stuck on a detail that shouldn’t have come as a surprise to anyone: Or, to zone in on the preoccupation, Fisher has aged — and allegedly “not well.” What this means is anyone’s guess. When the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds appeared on the big screen in “Return of the Jedi” wearing nothing more than a gold bikini, she instantly became the star of many a teenager’s fantasies. But that was more than three decades ago, and Fisher is now 59 years old. Not to mention, the latest iteration of Princess Leia is ostensibly no less formidable than the character that fans remember. She commands an entire resistance movement, after all, and manages to do so while remaining devoted to her family. Yet, discussion of Fisher’s weight has abated little since “The Force Awakens” premiered earlier this month. The actress, known these days for her wry repartee and Instagram-famous dog, shot back at her critics on Tuesday. Please stop debating about whetherOR not👁aged well.unfortunately it hurts all3 of my feelings.My BODY hasnt aged as well as I have.Blow us👌🏼 — Carrie Fisher (@carrieffisher) December 29, 2015 Youth&BeautyR/NOT ACCOMPLISHMENTS,theyre theTEMPORARY happy/BiProducts/of Time&/or DNA/Dont Hold yourBreath4either/ifUmust holdAir/takeGarys — Carrie Fisher (@carrieffisher) December 30, 2015 She also retweeted comments from supporters, including one who said, “Men don’t age better than women, they’re just allowed to age.” Another posted an image mimicking the “Star Wars” marquee opening that reads: “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away….Someone else might have given a f—k.” Fisher let a couple of her dissenters have their say on her feed, too. She retweeted one “TomRoberts983a” who said, “So you want the money & adulation that comes with being a famous actor but not the criticism. Whoever told you life was fair?” This is the latest in a string of comments Fisher has recently made about being an older woman in Hollywood. In the first week of December, she lamented both that she had to lose weight for “The Force Awakens” and that it’s difficult for actress over 40 to find work. “They don’t want to hire all of me – only about three-quarters!” Fisher told Good Housekeeping, which reported that the actress was “pressured” to lose 35 pounds. “Nothing changes, it’s an appearance-driven thing. I’m in a business where the only thing that matters is weight and appearance. That is so messed up. They might as well say get younger, because that’s how easy it is.” Her co-star Hamill, 64, told Rolling Stone that he also had to diet for his role. [Carrie Fisher ‘was pressured’ to lose 35 lbs. for new ‘Star Wars’ movie] A few days later, Fisher told Good Morning America’s Amy Robach that there was no question of whether she would return to “Star Wars.” “I’m a female in Hollywood over the age of, let’s say, 40. We could also say 50,” she said. “You don’t have to ask if you want to work at that age.” With the exception of Meryl Streep, 66, and Halle Berry, 49, middle-aged women and older are underrepresented in entertainment. According to The Washington Post’s Danielle Paquette, the 100 top-grossing films of 2014 starred no women over 45. A University of Southern California analysis found that actresses of all ages were “dramatically outnumbered” by men in movies — a state of affairs likely reinforced by Hollywood’s predominantly male writers, directors and casting directors.

When Brant returned to his hotel there was an augmented respect in the voice of the clerk as he handed him a note with the remark that it had been left by Senator Boompointer's coachman.

But then it was Susy's very triviality--so expressive of her characteristic irresponsibility--which had always affected him at such moments. Again, as at Robles, he felt it react against his own ethics. Was she not right in her delightful materialism?

If They are a tremendously able group of Americans., can we conclude that \\"They are very competent at their jobs.\\"?","output":"To determine if we can conclude that \\"They are very competent at their jobs\\" from the statement \\"They are a tremendously able group of Americans,\\" it is essential to examine both statements closely and assess the context in which they are being presented. Additionally, it is important to consider any additional information, characteristics, or qualities that are associated with this particular group of Americans, as well as any potential ambiguities in the given statement. Firstly, the statement \\"They are a tremendously able group of Americans\\" suggests that the individuals in question possess exceptional skills, abilities, or talents that set them apart from others. This could imply that they are outstanding in various areas, such as academics, arts, sports, leadership, creativity, or problem-solving, among others. In this context, the term \\"able\\" denotes that they are highly capable and successful in their respective fields. In contrast, the statement \\"They are very competent at their jobs\\" specifically addresses their job performance, focusing on their ability to execute their assigned tasks and responsibilities effectively and efficiently. Competence at work often implies having the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience to perform one's duties up to the expected standards and excelling in achieving desired results. Given the context provided in the original statement and the analysis of each statement, it is reasonable to deduce that being a tremendously able group of Americans might be relevant to their job competence. The individuals in this group are portrayed as possessing exceptional abilities, which could be applicable in their professional lives. However, it is crucial to consider that \\"able\\" is a broad term and could refer to skills or talents unrelated to their jobs. Furthermore, it is important to analyze the context in which these statements are presented. If the conversation or discussion is centered around professional achievements, workplace excellence, or job performance, then it is more likely that the statement about being tremendously able can be linked to their job competence. Conversely, if the conversation is about general talents or unrelated domains, there might not be a direct correlation between the two statements. Having considered both statements and the context in which they might be presented, it cannot be definitively concluded that \\"They are very competent at their jobs\\" just based on the statement \\"They are a tremendously able group of Americans.\\" While it is common for exceptionally able individuals to perform well in their professions, we need additional information to establish a definite link between their abilities and their job competence. Additional context or clarification about their skills and how they relate to their job performance would be necessary to make a conclusive judgement."},{"instruction":"Q:-  Some of the rock in the ground is made of limestone - Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone - And cause a acidic reaction - The limestone will slowly disintegrate - A large gap with be where the limestone was  What might be the last step of the process?

It's a transition into a new environment, with new responsibilities, new people, and new challenges that can evoke a range of emotions.  One potential emotion a person might experience when starting a new job is panic. This would usually be due to feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. Resting would not be an emotion but rather a state of being or activity, therefore can be eliminated from the choice.  Stress is another valid possibility because the pressures associated with a new job, such as learning new tasks, fitting into a new team, and meeting expectations, can indeed be stressful.  However, in this situation, the most appropriate answer would be \\"excitement.\\" Getting one's first job, in most cases, comes with a sense of achievement and anticipation. It is a milestone often greeted with eagerness as it usher an individual into a new stage of life, offering the prospect of personal growth and economic independence. The first job is also a platform to apply the knowledge and skills one has learned. Hence, these feelings of anticipation, eagerness, achievement, and novelty can all be associated with the emotion of excitement. Working, like resting, is also not an emotion but a state or activity one engages in. Therefore, it doesn't describe what the individual is feeling but rather what he is doing.  Hence, in conclusion, while starting a new job may come with feelings of panic and stress caused by the unfamiliarity and pressures of the new role, the emotion that stands out as the most significant and initiating state is excitement due to the positive emotions linked to this distinct stage of personal and professional development.

Élaboration d'un guide législatif sur les opérations garanties Which language is this?","output":"The language of the given phrase, \\"Élaboration d'un guide législatif sur les opérations garanties\\", is French.  This sentence can be translated into English as \\"Development of a legislative guide on guaranteed operations\\". Developing a legislative guide on guaranteed operations would involve heavy research, deep understanding of the current legislation, and detailed knowledge on the topic of “guaranteed operations”. 1. Understanding Guaranteed Operations: First and foremost, one should understand what is meant by \\"guaranteed operations\\". This likely refers to financial operations that have some kind of guarantee attached, such as a government guarantee. These guarantees often come into play in situations of loans or investments, ensuring that even if the borrower defaults or the investment fails, the lender/investor will be repaid up to a certain amount by the party providing the guarantee. Understanding the mechanics of how these operations work is crucial in developing the legislative guide.  2. Survey of Existing Legislation: Once the concept of guaranteed operations is clear, extensive research on existing legislation needs to be conducted. This will involve understanding different statutory regulations, case laws, and obligations attached with the guaranteed operations.  3. Stakeholder Analysis: Understanding the demographics of your audience is crucial when developing a legislative guide. Knowing who this guide will be used by, for example- financial institutions, government agencies, potential lenders, or investors, will shape the language, detail level, and complexity of the guide.  4. Structure of the Guide: A well-structured guide will comprise an introduction (explaining the purpose and aim of the guide), main body (explaining the detailed legislation and any points of consideration), possible scenarios or case studies, FAQ section (with questions likely to be asked by the stakeholder it is designed for), and a conclusion summarizing the overarching theme. 5. Regular Updates: Lastly, the guide should be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure it reflects the latest legislative changes. Remember, the objective of the legislative guide should be to simplify the understanding of legislations around guaranteed operations, providing a clear and unambiguous pathway, assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Division of Mayo is an Australian electoral division, the division is named after which female Australian medical doctor, and medical educator, social activist and the first woman elected to an Australian University Council? A:","output":"A: The Division of Mayo is an Australian electoral division named after Dr. Helen Mayo, a renowned female Australian medical doctor, medical educator, and social activist. Helen Mayo was born on October 1, 1878, in Adelaide, South Australia, and played a significant role in the advancement of women's rights and child welfare in Australia throughout her career.  Dr. Mayo completed her medical studies at the University of Adelaide and became one of the first women to graduate with a Bachelor of Medicine in 1902. She later furthered her education in England, gaining valuable experience in pediatrics and undertaking research in bacteriology and pathology. Upon her return to Adelaide, Dr. Mayo dedicated herself to improving the health and welfare of women and children. In 1909, alongside Dr. Harriet Stirling, Dr. Mayo founded the School for Mothers (which later became the Mothers and Babies Health Association), a pioneering initiative offering consultations and educational materials on childcare and hygiene to mothers around South Australia. This organization played a vital role in reducing infant mortality rates and improving the health of women and children in the region. In addition to her work in women's and children's health, Dr. Mayo was a tireless advocate for education and opportunities for women. She was the first woman elected to the University Council at the University of Adelaide in 1914 and was crucial in establishing the Women's Union at the university. Dr. Mayo's significant contributions to public health, education, and social reform made her a leading figure in South Australia during her lifetime. The Division of Mayo is named in her honor to recognize her remarkable achievements and the enduring impact of her work on the lives of countless Australian women and children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Outside the White House Friday, a media frenzy. And at the center of it all, President Donald Trump. “Can we do one question at a time? Wait! One question at a time,\\" the president scolded reporters. Trump launched a new attack on the Russia probe in the wake of a critical report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Justice. “I did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.  During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization. Nobody wants to report that. I got along with him great. We have a great chemistry together. That is a good thing, not a bad thing.\\" Trump also lashed out at opposition Democrats and tried to blame them for recent administration actions to separate family members caught trying to come across the U.S. border. “The Democrats forced that law upon our nation. I hate it. I hate to see separation of parents and children,\\" Trump said. According to the above context, answer the following question. When did the media frenzy occur?

Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\"? Answer:","output":"Question: How do incubating birds transfer warmth to their eggs, and what factors can influence the incubation period of different bird species? This question requires the students to understand the role of brood patches in transferring warmth from parents to the eggs, as well as recognizing that the incubation period varies among bird species due to factors like their specific biological and environmental needs."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: Each player attempts to get the football to their opponent's side. You decide how many attempts each player is allowed. Pushing the football across can be considered cheating, so it depends on how you and your opponent would like to play.  To get the ball across, place the football on your side of the field so that one corner is slightly off the edge of the surface. Then “flick” the corner of the ball hanging off the side with your index finger. When the football is down the field and you are allowed another attempt, you can lightly tap it forward with your index and middle fingers. Flip a coin to decide who starts first. Once you get the football to your opponent's side in the allotted attempts, you are in touchdown territory. In order to score a touchdown, one part of the football must hang off the opponent's edge.  A touchdown is worth 6 points, if you want to follow actual football guidelines. Yet, if you want to keep the game simple, make each touchdown 1 point.  To double check if the football did in fact hang over the edge to score a touchdown, bend down so that you can look upwards at the bottom of the surface edge and the football. This angle will make it easier to determine if a piece of the football is past the edge. Once you score a touchdown, you can kick a field goal to get extra points. Have your opponent do finger goal posts, or place down the goal post you made, at their side of the field. If you can kick the football between the goalposts, you get 3 points if following football guidelines or 1 point if keeping the game simple. To kick a field goal, place the football vertically, pressing one point with your index finger onto the surface. Hold it there to keep it steady, and when you are ready, flick the football with your free index finger towards the goal posts. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article describes a tabletop football game played by flicking a small football across a surface with the aim of getting it to the opponent's side.

He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would fork B's wave have more or less energy than fork A's wave?  Hint: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.)

Please write a short summary for the following article: UK man pleads guilty for failed Donald Trump assassination attempt A British man has pleaded guilty to charges that could get him about two years in a US prison and deported for trying to grab a police officer's gun to shoot Donald Trump at a June campaign rally in Las Vegas. Michael Steven Sandford entered the pleas to being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official function. \\"I tried to take a gun from a policeman to shoot someone with, and I'm pleading guilty,\\" Sandford told the judge. Sandford could have faced up to 20 years in a US prison if he had been convicted at trial of both charges. Sandford, 20, was arrested on June 18 after trying to grab the gun in a 1500-seat venue at Treasure Island hotel-casino. Sandford didn't get the gun, and no shots were fired before he was arrested. Sanford entered his pleas after his mother, Lynne Sandford, and a lawyer arrived from London and met with him in custody last week. Family lawyer Saimo Chahal said a psychiatrist she enlisted to review the case determined that Sandford was delusional at the time of the attempted attack. Sandford also suffers seizures, obsession-compulsion, anxiety and autism spectrum disorders, Chahal said. \\"Michael was not in control at the time of the events and needs help,'' the lawyer said in an email before the plea in US District Court in Las Vegas. \\"He is desperate to return to the UK to be near his family as he has no ties with the USA.\\" Court documents say Sandford acknowledged asking the police officer at the event if he could get Trump's autograph then reaching with both hands for the officer's 9mm handgun. Sandford later told a federal agent that he drove from California to Las Vegas with a plan to kill Trump, and that he rented a 9mm pistol and fired 20 shots at a paper target at a Las Vegas gun range the day before Trump's appearance, according to court documents. He also said he expected he would be killed during the assassination attempt, but that if he wasn't, he would make another attempt on Trump's life at a rally in Phoenix, court documents state. As a result of his plea, \\"It is almost certain that he will be permanently removed ... and will not be able to return to the United States at any time in the future,'' the document said. Summary:","output":"A man from the UK tried to take a police officer's gun to shoot Donald Trump at an event in Las Vegas. The man, named Michael Steven Sandford, said he was guilty and could spend around two years in a US prison before being sent back to the UK. Michael didn't get the gun and no one was hurt. His lawyer said Michael wasn't thinking clearly at the time and needs help.

This may feel strange at first. Try to adjust your foot position whenever you can remember. Schedule some time at home to walk around barefoot. This can increase foot dexterity and stretch the muscles. Sit with your legs strait and your feet flat against the wall. Place a pillow underneath your buttocks. Lean forward with your back straight. Hold for 10 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds and repeat 3 times. This stretch is especially important for people who wear high heels. Lie on your back with your buttocks a few inches from the wall. Place your legs in a \\"V\\" and straighten them. You should feel a stretch in your inner thighs and your arches. Lying with your feet elevated above your chest can also help to reduce swelling. There are a few easy moves that can help stretch your toes and provide relief. Try curling your toes around a pencil so that they can hold it up. Hold this pose for a few seconds before releasing the pencil. You can repeat this 2-3 times. You can also try picking up small objects like marbles or markers. Sit down and put your right foot over the top of your left thigh. Place the fingers of your left hand between the toes on your right foot. This helps to widen your toes and stretch them. Do this stretch for 1 to 5 minutes, and then repeat it on the opposite side. Rub sore feet with a topical gel that contains an anti-inflammatory aid. The act of rubbing feet may also relieve muscle tension. Treat foot soreness with the Rest, Immobilization, Cold, and Elevation (RICE) method if your foot pain is acute. Rest your feet when they start to hurt. Place an ice pack or a bag of ice wrapped in a towel on the most painful parts of your feet and wrap them with a bandage or towel. Elevate your feet so that they are above your heart in order to reduce inflammation.  You can also try the Movement, Elevation, Traction, and Heat (METH) method. While RICE helps reduce swelling and pain, METH can increase blood flow and promote healing.","output":"The text provides a comprehensive guide on how to care for, stretch, and strengthen your feet through exercise, proper positioning, and other methods. It's crucial for maintaining foot health, especially for those who wear high heels.  Starting with foot positioning, your feet should face forward and you can use a straight surface, such as a rug, wall, or yoga mat, to ensure the correct alignment. This might feel unfamiliar at first, but with time, the foot adjustment will become more natural. Walking barefoot at home is also advisable to enhance foot dexterity and stretch muscles. Certain stretches are also beneficial for foot health. Sitting with legs straight, feet flat against the wall, and a pillow underneath your buttocks and leaning forward with a straight back is one such stretch. You should perform this stretch three times, holding it for 10-seconds each and resting in between. This stretch can be particularly helpful for high heel wearers. Lying on your back, with your buttocks close to the wall and legs in a \\"V\\" position, is another useful stretch. It targets inner thighs and foot arches. Having your feet elevated above your chest while lying can also help in reducing swelling. Next is toe exercises. To stretch your toes, try holding a pencil by curling your toes around it and hold the position for a few seconds, then repeat it 2-3 times. Picking up small objects, like markers or marbles, can also be tried. Another toe stretching exercise includes sitting down and placing your foot over your other thigh and inserting the fingers of your non-stretched leg's hand between the toes of your stretched leg for 1 to 5 minutes. This should be repeated for the other side too. For sore feet, use a topical gel with an anti-inflammatory aid. This, in combination with the act of rubbing the feet, could alleviate muscle tension. Acute foot pain can be eased with the RICE (Rest, Immobilization, Cold, and Elevation) method. Rest when feet start to hurt, apply an ice pack or a bag of ice wrapped in a towel to the painful areas and bandage them, and then elevate your feet to a level above your heart to lessen inflammation. Alternatively, increasing blood flow and promoting healing can be achieved with the METH (Movement, Elevation, Traction, and Heat) method.

Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler (; Spanish pronunciation: [en'rike mi'gel i'glesjas 'preizler]; born 8 May 1975) is a Spanish singer, songwriter, actor and record producer. He is widely regarded as the King of Latin Pop. In 2002, Iglesias decided to release a fourth Spanish-language album titled Quizas (Perhaps). A more polished musical production than his previous Spanish albums and containing more introspective songs, the album's title track is a song about the strained relationship Iglesias has with his famous father.  The album debuted at number twelve on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the highest placement of a Spanish language album on the chart at that period. Quizas sold a million copies in a week, making it the fastest-selling album in Spanish in five years. The three singles released from the album all ended up topping the Latin chart, giving Iglesias a total of sixteen number ones on the chart. He currently holds the record for the most number one singles on Billboard's Latin Chart. His last single from the album, \\"Para Que La Vida\\", reached a million spins on U.S. radio, the only Spanish language song to do so.  The video to the song \\"Quizas\\" was the first Spanish language music video to be added to the selection on one of MTV's popular shows, Total Request Live. Iglesias performed the song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, becoming the first to sing a Spanish song on the show, and opening doors for other artists such as Ricky Martin, Juanes and Jorge Drexler to perform their Spanish material. Iglesias included songs from Quizas in his \\"Don't Turn Off the Lights Tour\\", and the album went on to win the Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.  By 2003 Iglesias released his seventh album, which he called 7, the second to be co-written by Iglesias. Among its more 1980s-inspired material, it features the song \\"Roamer\\", which he wrote with his friend and longtime guitarist, Tony Bruno. The CD also contained the song \\"Be Yourself\\", a song about independence (the chorus talks about how Iglesias' own parents did not believe he'd ever succeed in his singing career). The first single was the song \\"Addicted\\", and was followed closely by a remix of the song \\"Not in Love\\", featuring Kelis.  With this album, Iglesias went on his biggest world tour to date. The highly publicised tour started with twelve shows in the United States ending with Iglesias playing at Houston Rodeo and continued on to several countries, most of which he'd never previously visited playing to sold-out arenas and stadiums in Australia, India, Egypt and Singapore before ending his tour in South Africa.

Dogen shoots it down and finds one of Syn's crystals on the pilot's body. Carved into the crystal is a symbol of a dead tree. Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn fails to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong. Dogen awakes, but Dhyana is suddenly teleported away. A summoned monster appears in her place and fires electric bolts at him. Dhyana simultaneously faces Syn in his lair. Dogen shorts-out the creature, and it vanishes. Dogen arrives in Zhor and finds Rhodes, a washed-up soldier, in a bar. Rhodes denies the lost city's existence and refuses to get involved. Dogen leaves and comes upon a group of miners beating a captured nomad soldier. Dogen assists him, and the miners turn hostile.

In the coastal redwood forests of central California, scientists trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the reproductive problems of dozens of endangered condors think they have uncovered the culprit: the long-banned pesticide DDT. The soaring scavengers with wingspans wider than NBA players are tall were reintroduced to the rugged coast of Big Sur in 1997 after a century-long absence. Upon arrival, the birds found plenty to eat, with dead California sea lions and other marine mammals littering the craggy shoreline. While a good food source, sea lion blubber often has high levels of DDT, a pesticide banned in 1972 that has proven to be a persistent pollutant because it accumulates in bodies of creatures throughout the food chain when animals eat one another. Endangered: Condors on California's central coast are having reproductive problems because of DDT. Once used widely in agriculture, DDT was banned because it is a human toxin considered a possible carcinogen by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kelly Sorenson, executive director of Ventana Wildlife Society and a co-author of a new study on condors, said researchers who spent six years studying their reproductive problems have 'established a strong link' to DDT in the birds' food source. The peer-reviewed paper written by 10 condor experts, including biologists from the Los Angeles and Santa Barbara zoos and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is being published this month in the University of California journal 'The Condor.' 'In science, rarely is anything definitive but we've established a strong link between ... DDT and eggshell thinning in California condors,' said Mr Sorenson. Dinner time: Condors feed on the remains of a marine mammal on a beach in Big Sur. The eggshell mystery began in 2006, when a biologist inspecting a condor nest in the cavity of a redwood tree on the central California coast found the first thin shell. Over the next six years, the scientists observed condors feeding on dozens of sea lions, and found that the Big Sur condor population had a low hatching success — just 20-40 percent — for 16 nesting pairs. In contrast, 70-80 percent of southern California condors in the Tejon area had hatched successfully over the same time. The southern California condors are inland, and sea lions are not a food source. Biologists familiar with the ravages of DDT in bird populations immediately suspected the widely used pesticide as a factor. Tests since the 1970s have found high levels of DDT in sea lions; and studies have linked DDT's metabolized version, DDE, to egg shell thinning in birds, including brown pelicans and bald eagles. Majestic: Condors wingspans are wider than NBA players are tall. The condor study attributed at least eight of 16 egg failures to thinning from DDT. One shell found crushed in a nest was 54-percent thinner than normal. Thinning can also allow bacteria to more easily enter the eggs. But why did the sea lions have such high DDT levels in the first place? The scientists theorize that the sea mammals were exposed when they migrated to the central coast from southern California, where the Montrose Chemical Corp. dumped DDT with impunity for decades until the 1970s. The Montrose plant and the ocean off Palos Verdes where it dumped DDT are now listed as Environmental Protection Agency 'Superfund' sites. Less hatching: California condor eggs hatch less than half as much on the central coast than they do to the south. 'A vast majority of California sea lions have spent at least a portion of their lives in the waters of southern California, which is the most DDT-contaminated coastal environment in the world,' Mr Sorenson said. 'Northward movements of sea lions provide a pathway of DDT to condors in central California.' The study's authors and other experts agree that lead ammunition, not DDT, is the main threat to the survivability of condors. But Jesse Grantham, a former condor program coordinator for Fish and Wildlife who did not participate in the study, called the paper's findings helpful scientific evidence that will add to the overall picture of threats facing condor recovery. Another former condor program manager, Noel Snyder, was critical of the DDT study, however. He said it only looks closely at one potential cause of reproductive problems — DDT — and fails to properly evaluate the potential effects of other contaminants and factors that may be involved and more important. 'DDT is not the only thing that causes. eggshell thinning, and the authors of the paper don't present a. significant correlation of DDT with the thinning found, and thus do not. do a convincing job of linking DDT with the happenings in Big Sur.' Big Sur: Though beautiful, Big Sur is contaminated with DDT. Study author and Ventana wildlife biologist Joe Burnett defended the team's work, saying all data pointed to the pesticide as the problem. 'We collected data on many different environmental toxins but none, other than DDE, were even in the ballpark known to cause reproductive failure in birds,' Mr Burnett said. In the final analysis, the study's authors say the DDT problem will fade over time. 'Like bald eagles and other bird species previously affected by DDT, the thickness of condor eggshells should recover as contamination declines in the coastal environment,' said co-author Robert Risebrough, an expert on the effects of DDT on birds.

His friend Ryan Shoos is dismissive of the play, and comes up with the idea to vandalize the set. Reese is reluctant to take part, but agrees when Ryan promises that he'll be able to console Pfeifer afterwards, giving them a chance to kiss. Later that night, Reese, Ryan, and Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy Spilker sneak into the school, only to run into Pfeifer, who saw Reese's car. Knowing they cannot vandalize the sets with Pfeifer there, the group tries to leave, but finds that they have been locked inside, and there is no cell phone reception.

Q: Context: Recent psychopharmacological studies lend support to the notion of partially dissociable neuronal systems dedicated to processing specific emotions. For example, GABA-ergic enhancement after an acute dose of the benzodiazepine, diazepam, produces specific impairments in anger and fear recognition. However, it is unclear if these impairments are a general property of benzodiazepines and other drugs that produce a similar profile of neurocognitive impairment to benzodiazepines, such as the anticholinergic, scopolamine.', 'We investigated the effects of scopolamine and the benzodiazepine, lorazepam, on emotion-recognition accuracy.', 'A double-blind independent group design was used with 48 healthy volunteers to compare the effects of scopolamine and lorazepam with an inactive placebo on a commonly used emotion-recognition task. Control measures included an episodic memory task and subjective mood ratings.', 'Anger and disgust recognition accuracy was impaired after scopolamine. In contrast, lorazepam produced no impairment in emotion-recognition despite producing similar levels of sedation and anterograde amnesia to scopolamine. Answer: Scopolamine-induced cholinergic hypofunction selectively impaired the recognition accuracy of disgust and anger facial expressions. The effects of scopolamine on emotion-recognition are similar to those found in Huntington's disease patients. Furthermore, the impairments in anger and fear recognition previously observed with diazepam do not appear to be a general property of benzodiazepines. This suggests that alterations in emotional processing involving changes in the ability to recognize threat-related emotions (particularly, fear and anger) may not be a principal mechanism underlying anxiolysis or paradoxical aggression seen with benzodiazepines.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others... How persuasive does the North Korea leader likely think his claim that he had missiles that could reach the US was, following the summit conclusion? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. probably not believable at all  B. not enough information  C. likely very convincing  D. not too persuasive A:","output":"C. likely very convincing Given the context of North Korea's missile tests and the increased tension between the country and the United States, it is probable that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un believed his claim regarding the missile capability was quite convincing. The claim likely contributed to prompting diplomatic negotiations and the U.S.-North Korean summit, significantly changing the tone of the dialogue between the two nations. Pyongyang's shift to diplomacy, coupled with the show of force by successfully test-firing missiles it claimed could reach the United States, provided the world with a glimpse of North Korea's arsenals and potential capabilities. The fact that an unprecedented summit took place between the U.S. President and the North Korean leader suggests that both sides felt the pressing need to discuss and address the security threat. Furthermore, North Korea's past behavior of not adhering to agreements, as mentioned by Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife from Seoul, might also suggest that Kim Jong Un felt confident in his claims. In the recent years, North Korea has been focused on developing and showcasing its missile technology, which has alarmed the international community. In conclusion, while the North Korean leader might be over-estimating the credibility of his claims, based on the events leading up to and following the summit, it can be asserted that Kim Jong Un likely perceived his claims of missile capabilities reaching the U.S. as very convincing (option C). However, it should be noted that this analysis is based on an assumption about Kim Jong Un's beliefs and not an absolute fact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Interpol has issued an international wanted notice for conservationist and “Whale Wars” TV star Paul Watson, days after he skipped bail in Germany as Costa Rica tried to have him extradited.      Watson was arrested at Germany’s Frankfurt airport on May 13 on an arrest warrant issued by Costa Rica, which accuses him of endangering a fishing vessel off the coast of Guatemala in 2002.      He posted roughly 302,000 bail and was ordered to remain in Germany as it considered Costa Rica’s extradition request, but he stopped reporting to authorities on July 22, a German court said. Watson left Germany and forfeited his bail, according to his Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which isn’t revealing his location.      “Following confirmation from German authorities that Paul Watson had failed to satisfy the bail conditions established by the German courts and had fled the country, Costa Rican authorities renewed their request” for Interpol to issue an international wanted notice for Watson, which Interpol did Tuesday, Interpol said.      Costa Rican authorities allege that Watson – whose attempts to disrupt Japanese whalers at sea gained him fame on Animal Planet’s “Whale Wars” TV show – and his crew aboard Sea Shepherd’s Ocean Warrior ship endangered a Costa Rican fishing vessel during a confrontation off Guatemala’s coast.      The U.S.-based Sea Shepherd denies the allegations, arguing that the charges have less to do with law than with Watson’s anti-conservationist enemies.      In the 2002 incident, according to Sea Shepherd ship operations officer Peter Hammarstedt, the Ocean Warrior found a Costa Rican crew killing sharks for their fins in Guatemalan waters. The Ocean Warrior initially had permission from Guatemalan authorities to stop it and tow the vessel into port, he said.      The Ocean Warrior used water cannons on the fishing vessel, but “there were no injuries and no physical damage to any ship,” Hammarstedt said in May.      The Ocean Warrior did stop the ship, but Guatemalan authorities eventually asked Watson to release it, Hammarstedt said.      The confrontation is detailed in part of a 2007 documentary, “Sharkwater,” Hammarstedt said.      Shark finning is the practice of cutting the fins off sharks and throwing the sharks back into the sea, where they die. The fins are used for expensive soup, mostly in China.      The current charge, according to Interpol, is “causing a danger of drowning or of an air disaster.”      Sea Shepherd says that “anyone who’s viewed the documentary can clearly see the charges are bogus.”      “The water cannon Captain Watson allegedly used to stop the illegal shark finners never reached the wheelhouse, thereby having no possibility of interfering with their safe navigation, nor were there any aircraft overhead at the time so as to potentially cause an ‘air disaster,’” Sea Shepherd said in a statement issued Wednesday.      Interpol’s wanted notices, called red notices, are sent to police agencies across the world, but they are not arrest warrants.      “Each of Interpol’s 190 member countries must apply their national laws and standards in determining whether it may detain or arrest the wanted person,” Interpol says.

They both agreed this region has run out of fresh water and are using sea water or treated wastewater in their district cooling and refrigeration. Water scarcity continues to be a pressing issue, affecting not only human beings and their livelihoods but also various industries and ecosystems around the world. Nowhere is this scarcity more evident than in the Middle East, a region that has faced chronic water shortages for decades. Experts and analysts have been raising alarms about the urgency of this situation for years, calling for immediate and long-term solutions to address this critical challenge. The Middle East, predominantly composed of arid and semi-arid regions, experiences high temperatures throughout much of the year, which have only worsened due to climate change. This has led to an ever-increasing demand for water resources to meet the needs of its growing population and support its thriving agriculture and industrial sectors. The rapid growth of cities in the region, along with rising industrialization, has only served to exacerbate the problem. In a recent discussion between two experts, they both agreed that the Middle East has run out of fresh water resources, particularly due to significant over-extraction of groundwater, recurrent droughts, and the limited number of renewable water sources. This has forced many countries in the region to look for alternatives to meet their water needs. One such solution being adopted by several Middle Eastern nations is the utilization of sea water or treated wastewater in district cooling and refrigeration systems. These systems work by redistributing cooled or heated water to reduce the need for individual air conditioning units or heating systems, thus conserving energy and alleviating pressure on dwindling water resources. By incorporating treated wastewater or seawater, district cooling and refrigeration systems are designed to minimize the use of fresh water and efficiently manage water resources. The use of seawater for cooling and refrigeration systems is a relatively straightforward process, with the water being pumped, filtered, and treated before being used in the systems. On the other hand, the reuse of wastewater in these systems involves a more complex set of technologies to remove pollutants and contaminants from the water to ensure it is safe for use. Despite the innovative initiatives and investments being made in the water sector, there is still a long way to go in addressing the water scarcity crisis in the Middle East. Developing sophisticated technologies and infrastructure to improve water management, promoting water conservation measures, and encouraging regional cooperation in sharing water resources are just some of the strategies that need to be pursued in order to prevent this issue from escalating further. In conclusion, the Middle East is grappling with an immense water scarcity challenge that has driven the region to adopt alternative sources of water, such as seawater and treated wastewater, for use in district cooling and refrigeration systems. This measure aims to mitigate the demand for fresh water resources and help countries in the region deal with the constraints imposed by their arid environment. It is clear that further actions, initiatives, and sustainable solutions are needed to address this complex problem and ensure water security in the region for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Superstorm Sandy's march of destruction claimed at least 43 lives and left more than eight million people without electricity by late Tuesday, in one of the largest storms ever to strike the East Coast. Less violent but still dangerous, the storm swept across Pennsylvania on Tuesday and the northeastern US began its slow process of recovery. As dawn broke Tuesday on the storm's trail of destruction, it began exposing stories of heroism and tragedy, bad decisions and lucky breaks. In Broad Channel in New York City, a 29-year-old mother was forced to dive and swim out of her house's front window with her 8-year-old daughter. And in Freeport, N.Y., Nicole Smith returned home --- to find a boat on her lawn. She asked passers-by for 5 to take a snapshot. A 13-year-old girl was found dead, in her pajamas, a block from her washed-out Staten Island home. On Monday night, Sandy's waves ripped out the entire deck of Jeffrey Ratner's home, along with the back wall. Still, Mr. Ratner said, he remains optimistic about the future. \\"We are going to rebuild it,\\" he said. The official warnings to evacuate were clear, a couple said.

Chasteberry may help relieve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, although scientific evidence is currently limited. However, it has not been proven to reduce menopausal symptoms, increase lactation, or increase fertility.  Chasteberry has been shown to influence estrogen levels. However, the exact nature and level of the effect has not been widely established.  Avoid taking chasteberry if you are using: birth control pills, antipsychotic drugs, medications used to treat Parkinson's disease, or Metoclopramide, a dopamine-affecting drug. Phytoestrogens act like an estrogen substitute in the body and occur naturally in several plants and herbs. Consider using phytoestrogens if you're trying to alleviate symptoms of low estrogen levels, or menopause. Take phytoestrogens in moderation. You may actually want to avoid phytoestrogens if you're trying to conceive. Phytoestrogens have been linked to infertility and developmental problems, although you would need to consume massive quantities of these foods to ingest clinically significant levels of phytoestrogens. Foods and herbs that contain phytoestrogens include:  legumes: soybeans, peas, pinto and lima beans fruits: cranberries, prunes, apricots herbs: oregano, sage, licorice whole grains flaxseed vegetables: broccoli and cauliflower Several herbal teas or tisanes may increase your estrogen levels or provide relief for symptoms of menopause or premenstrual syndrome without affecting your estrogen levels. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for five minutes.  Black and green tea. Black and green teas contain phytoestrogens.  Dong quai (Angelica sinensis). Used in Chinese traditional medicine, this herb may reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Do not use it if you use blood-thinning drugs like warfarin. Red clover. Red clover contains isoflavones, which may help reduce symptoms of menopause or premenstrual syndrome. Flax seeds have one of the highest concentrations of phytoestrogens. Eat up to 1/2 cup of ground flax seeds to get the most effect. They're also high in omega-3 fatty acids, which may reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. Adding flax seed to your breakfast cereal or in healthy smoothies is a good way to easily eat the seed.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Joséphine-Éléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn (1825–1860) married Albert de Broglie on 18 June 1845, and they had five sons together. Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis. After her death, Albert published three volumes of her essays on religious history.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Q: All the atoms of a given element have the same number of what in their nucleus, though they may have different numbers of neutrons?   A: The answer is:","output":"All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus, though they may have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms are the building blocks of all matter, and they consist of a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons, which are surrounded by a cloud of electrons. Elements are defined by the number of protons they contain, which is referred to as the atomic number. This atomic number is unique for each element, meaning that no two elements can have the same number of protons. Protons are positively charged subatomic particles found in the nucleus of an atom. They are an essential aspect of determining the properties of an element, as their charge directly influences the behavior and interactions of the atom. For instance, the number of protons in an atom determines the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus, thereby impacting the element's chemical reactivity, atomic size, and the formation of chemical bonds with other atoms. While neutrons are also present in the nucleus, they do not have any charge, and their number can vary among atoms of the same element. This variation results in the formation of isotopes, which are essentially different forms of the same element with differing numbers of neutrons. Isotopes display the same chemical properties as their corresponding element, owing to the fact that their proton count remains the same. However, isotopic differences can contribute to changes in atomic mass and stability, with some isotopes exhibiting radioactive properties. In summary, all the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus, which defines the characteristics and properties of that element. While the number of neutrons present in an atom of the same element may vary, their difference does not alter the fundamental chemical behavior of the element due to the proton count remaining constant."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Was the decision by the Indian Government to demonetize 500 and 1000 notes right or is it a big scam?","output":"While the two questions are related and both concern the Indian government's decision to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes, they are not the same question. They are different in their intent and the type of response they solicit. 1. The first question, \\"What do you think of the decision by the Indian government to demonetize 500 and 1000 rupee notes?\\" asks for a general opinion about the event and an overall analysis of its implications. This question seeks an evaluation of the action taken by the government, its context, the factors that led to the decision, and the potential positive and negative results it brought about. In response to the first question, one might detail the background leading up to the demonetization, which took place on November 8, 2016, and involved the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, declaring that all 500 and 1000-rupee banknotes would be invalid. The objective was to combat corruption, black money, and counterfeit currency while promoting a cashless economy and increased tax compliance. This decision had significant implications for the Indian economy and its citizens, with both supporters and critics. Some positive consequences of demonetization include a push towards digital transactions, tax compliance improvements, and greater transparency. On the other hand, the negative consequences include a slowdown in economic growth, long lines at banks, cash shortages, and the burden on low-income groups and rural citizens who had limited access to banking facilities. 2. The second question, \\"Was the decision by the Indian Government to demonetize 500 and 1000 notes right or is it a big scam?\\" poses a more direct and binary inquiry. In this case, the respondent is asked to take a definitive stance on the matter – either the decision was right or a scam. It assumes a potential conflict, suggesting that the demonetization could be considered fraudulent or inappropriate. This question is more likely to elicit a response that delves into the motivations behind the decision, the political environment at the time, and the possible consequences of considering it a scam. Answering the second question, it is essential to consider the factors that led to demonetization, the transparency and communication around the decision, and its impact on various stakeholders. Some critics argue that demonetization was a political move designed to hurt the opposition, while others claim that the benefits outweigh any short-term drawbacks. It is crucial to analyze the available data, reports, and studies on the issue, as well as the goals of the government and the overall context in which the decision was made, to take a definitive stance on this matter. In conclusion, while both questions focus on the Indian government's decision to demonetize 500 and 1000-rupee notes, they are not the same. The first question seeks a general understanding and assessment of the issue, while the second question calls for a more binary and definitive stance on the matter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is important for you to get some knowledge about first aid in your daily life. If a person has an accident, he / she needs medical care before a doctor can be found. When you give first aid, you must know three things: First, when a person stops breathing  , open his / her mouth to see if there is food in his / her mouth. Second, if a person cannot breathe, try to start his / her breathing at once, using a mouth-to-mouth way. Third, if a person is hurt badly, try to stop the bleeding   at once. And then take him / her to a doctor, because if a person loses one third of his / her blood, he / she may be in great danger. Many accidents may happen at home, and everyone should know some first aid to deal with common injuries. When a person _ by an animal, wash the wound with cold running water before he / she is taken to see a doctor. When a person is burnt, wash and cool the area of the skin under the cold tap for a while, then put a piece of dry clean cloth over the burn. If a person is badly burnt, take him / her to the doctor.

Sentence 2: There is no doubt that Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's break down the information in each sentence step by step. Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1 content Sentence 1 states that \\"from the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife as sure as I stand here.\\" This implies that the speaker believes Mr. Inglethorp to be guilty of murder based on the evidence presented. Additionally, the speaker expresses confidence and says they'd laugh at anyone who suggested otherwise. Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2 content Sentence 2 simply states that \\"there is no doubt that Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife.\\" This means that the speaker seems to believe without any uncertainty that Mr. Inglethorp is guilty of murder. Step 3: Compare the content of Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 Both sentences express the same main idea: that Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife. However, Sentence 1 provides more context by referring to the evidence at the inquest, and the speaker's confidence in their belief. Sentence 2 is more straightforward and does not include this additional context. Step 4: Determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1 Considering the content of both sentences, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence.

So I was still traveling through a forest in a sleigh  when the sun went down. It was a long way from my friend's house when about twenty wolves began to follow my sleigh. It was very dark in the forest. There was thick snow on the ground. It was cold, and there were no houses for miles and miles. First I heard the wolves. The noise was terrible! The horses heard them, too. They were frightened and began running faster. Then I saw long, gray forms among the trees, and soon the wolves were near us. They were running very fast, and they didn't seem to get tired like the horses.\\" \\"What did you do?\\" one of Jack's friends asked. \\"When the wolves got very near,\\" Jack answered, \\"I put up my gun and shot the first wolf. The sleigh was moving about, but I hit the animal and killed it. Then all the other wolves stopped and ate it, so our sleigh got away from them for a few minutes.\\" \\"Then they finished their meal, and I heard them coming again. The moon was shining brightly on the snow now, and after a few minutes I saw them running among the trees once more. They came nearer again, and then I shot another of them, and the others stopped once more to eat it.\\" \\"The same thing happened again and again, and my horses became more and more tired and ran slower and slower until, after about two hours, only one wolf was still alive and following us.\\" \\"Wasn't it too fat to run?\\" one of his friends asked.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Palmyra (; Palmyrene:  Tadmor; Arabic: تَدْمُر‎ Tadmur) is an ancient Semitic city in present-day Homs Governorate, Syria. Archaeological finds date back to the Neolithic period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the Roman Empire in the first century AD. The city grew wealthy from trade caravans; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the Great Colonnade, the Temple of Bel, and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of Amorites, Arameans, and Arabs. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke Palmyrene (a dialect of Aramaic), while using Greek for commercial and diplomatic purposes. Greco-Roman culture influenced the culture of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic deities, Mesopotamian and Arab gods. By the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by regent Queen Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian destroyed the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic. Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries AD.
