Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Sondra Crench kicked a roach out of her way as she walked into her tiny apartment and sat down at her old laptop. It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games. Sounded pretty cool for kids. She wished there had been such a place when she was growing up there. But what really caught her eye was the note about auditions for a house band. It would play two hours a night, and earn 2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by. And besides, her band could do other gigs during the week to supplement it. Question: How old is Sondra? Answer: A:","output":"(i). 30. (ii). not enough information. (iii). 45. (iv). 25.

Sondra is looking for a secretarial job, which indicates that she is of an age where she is in the workforce. 3. Sondra is a working musician and feels she has more in common with actresses than secretaries, implying that she might be of a younger age with an artistic lifestyle. 4. She occasionally sees her old classmates in wedding announcements, which may suggest that she is at an age where her peers are settling down and starting families. 5. The context reveals that Sondra is considering working at a venue that caters to ages 12-20, which might be too young for Sondra since she wishes such a place existed when she \\"was growing up.\\" 6. Sondra is thinking of moving back with her mother for a while, implying that she is not yet at an age where moving back with a parent is a completely unviable option.

Write some highlights for the following article: ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Four people in two states have been arrested as part of an investigation into the Final Exit Network, an organization that police believe helped a Georgia man end his life in June, authorities said Thursday. Claire Blehr, 76, of Georgia, and Thomas E. Goodwin, 63, of Florida and Georgia, were two of the four arrested. John Celmer, 58, lived in Cumming, north of Atlanta. Cumming police, the Forsyth County coroner and the man's relatives all had suspicions that his death was an assisted suicide, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation  launched an investigation, the agency said in a news release. The GBI on Wednesday set up a sting operation at a residence in adjoining Dawson County, using an undercover agent who had posed as a terminally ill man seeking assistance with his suicide, the statement said. Claire Blehr, 76, of Atlanta, Georgia, and Thomas E. Goodwin, 63, of both Punta Gorda, Florida, and Kennesaw, Georgia, were arrested, the GBI said. Meanwhile, authorities in Baltimore, Maryland, arrested Dr. Lawrence D. Egbert, 81, of Baltimore in connection with the investigation. A second person, Nicholas Alec Sheridan, 60, also of Baltimore, was arrested Wednesday night, GBI spokesman John Bankhead said Thursday. All four face charges of assisted suicide, tampering with evidence and violation of the Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the GBI said. The Final Exit Network, based in the north Atlanta suburb of Marietta, identifies itself on its Web site as \\"an all-volunteer organization dedicated to serving people who are suffering from an intolerable condition. Network volunteers offer you counseling, support and even guidance to self-deliverance at a time and place of your choosing, but you always do the choosing. We will never encourage you to hasten your death.\\" Celmer suffered from \\"very, very severe mouth and throat cancer,\\" his 85-year-old mother, Betty Celmer, said from her home in the Buffalo, New York, suburb of East Amherst. \\"They were rebuilding the whole mouth,\\" she said. \\"He was suffering terribly, that I know.\\" She said her son had undergone numerous surgeries and \\"sounded depressed.\\" When he died, she said she had no idea his death might have been a suicide. In a statement released by the GBI, Celmer's widow, Susan, said that she and her family \\"are gratified that the GBI and other law enforcement agencies have pursued this matter vigorously and that their investigation has led to the arrests reported today.\\" She said she will not comment further and requested privacy, referring future questions to her attorneys. An e-mail to Jerry Dincin, a man listed as Final Exit Network's vice president and treasurer on its Web site, was not answered Thursday. A call to Final Exit was answered by a recording. The method used in the suicide was helium inhalation, according to the GBI statement. People pay 50 to join the Final Exit Network, according to the GBI, and complete an application process. They are then visited by an \\"exit guide\\" assigned to the case. \\"During the visitations, the member is instructed to purchase two helium tanks of a specific size and brand and a specific type of hood known as an 'exit bag,' \\" according to the GBI statement. \\"On the day of the event, the member is visited by the 'exit guide' and a 'senior exit guide.' The senior exit guide instructs the member through the process.\\" Goodwin and Blehr were told the GBI agent suffered from pancreatic cancer, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. At the Dawson County residence on Wednesday, Goodwin allegedly walked the undercover agent through the steps and demonstrated how he would hold the agent's hands to stop him from removing the exit bag, Bankhead said. The GBI said that after the death occurs, \\"all evidence is removed from the scene by the 'guides' and discarded, as evidence indicated happened in the Cumming case.\\" Goodwin's former neighbors in Kennesaw told CNN he moved to Florida a few years ago but still owns his large home there and returns to check on it occasionally. Kay Makarenko, 69, who lives behind Goodwin's home, said she was shocked to hear of his arrest. \\"I said, 'It can't be the same Ted Goodwin.' \\" After the arrests Wednesday, authorities in Georgia, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Colorado and Montana began executing search warrants and conducting interviews as part of the probe into the Final Exit Network, the GBI said, adding that GBI agents were in each state except Colorado to assist. In Phoenix, Arizona, police have linked the 2007 death of a 58-year-old woman to the Final Exit Network, Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas said Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate KPHO-TV in Phoenix. Thomas said the woman, Jana Van Voorhis, was not terminally ill but suffered from mental illness and depression. He said a police investigation turned up records of visits from Final Exit guides to Voorhis, according to KPHO. No arrests have been made, but Thomas said he expects his office to wrap up its investigation and decide if charges are warranted within 60 days. CNN affiliate WDIV-TV in Detroit, Michigan, reported that search warrants were executed regarding two Michigan residents who sit on Final Exit's board of directors. The Final Exit Network Web site features a \\"Wall of Fame\\" with photos of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, among others. Kevorkian was released on parole in June 2007 after serving more than eight years of a 10- to 25-year sentence in the 1998 death of a man suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. \\"We believe the needs of those who are suffering are paramount,\\" the organization says. \\"We applaud the work of organizations that seek legislative action to strengthen our right to die a peaceful and painless death at the time and place of our choosing. However, we feel that legislative change will not come soon enough for the many people who need help now and in the interim.\\" Betty Celmer, meanwhile, declined to share her thoughts on assisted suicide or the Final Exit Network's alleged involvement in her son's death, saying she lacks specifics. \\"He's in a far better place,\\" she said. \\"That's the only comment I'm going to make.\\" CNN's Ashley Broughton and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.

A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - Holland is a region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. The name \\"Holland\\" is also frequently used to informally refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. This usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and not entirely uncommon among the Dutch themselves, though some in the Netherlands and particularly in other regions of the country may find it undesirable, misleading or insulting.  - Adriaan van Wijngaarden ( 2 November 1916 -- 7 February 1987 ) was a Dutch mathematician and computer scientist , who is considered by many to have been the founding father of informatica ( computer science ) in the Netherlands . Even though he was trained as an engineer , van Wijngaarden would emphasize and promote the mathematical aspects of computing , first in numerical analysis , then in programming languages and finally in design principles of programming languages .  - The Hague (or \\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s-Gravenhage\\" ) is a city located in the western coast of the Netherlands, and the capital city of the province of South Holland.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.

Its history goes back to 1270 when a dam was constructed in the Rotte river by people settled around it for safety. In 1340 Rotterdam was granted city rights by the Count of Holland and slowly grew into a major logistic and economic centre. Nowadays it is home to Europe's largest port and has a population of 633,471 (city proper), ranking second in the Netherlands. The Greater Rijnmond area is home to approximately 1.4 million people and the Rotterdam The Hague Metropolitan Area makes for the 168th most populous urban area in the world. Rotterdam is part of the yet larger Randstad conurbation with a total population of 7,100,000.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world.

Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries).  - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.  - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.  - Amsterdam is the capital and most populous municipality of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br> It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox.  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices.

On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help.

Not only did the British quintet pioneer the digital-rush-release strategy that’s been adopted by artists from Beyoncé to Kanye West, their ever-starker view of the world around them—which started off in a pretty dark place to begin with, as evidenced by their initial breakout single “Creep”—is matched by music that trembles with anxiety and fear beneath even its most beautiful facades. A Moon-Shaped Pool, Radiohead’s ninth record, doesn’t just speak to these tensions; it serenades them. On the surface, the album—which came out on Sunday, capping a whirlwind promotional cycle that began with the erasure of the band’s social media profiles—is a beautiful work, with textures that can cascade over a listener like water. The band balances the demands of art-rock—unbridled grandiosity, big and possibly unanswerable questions, lengthy songs—with precision approaches to their craft, as Thom Yorke’s unparalleled wail steers the ship. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood, who has written scores for epics like The Master and Inherent Vice, worked with the new-music ensemble the London Contemporary Orchestra on rounding out the record’s sound, giving the band’s offerings an even more potent wallop. The central questions that have lurked underneath Radiohead’s music over the past two-plus decades—which essentially boil down to, “How can you be a feeling and thinking human in a fairly (and seemingly increasingly) uncaring world?”—are on full display here, with lyrics that concisely, and sometimes bluntly, depict precarity and the possibility of anything good being an illusion. The music matches. Sounds dip in and out of the mix, compelling this listener to rewind and make sure that she’d heard correctly, echoing the menacingly surrealistic portraits of nature offered up by the gently glowering “Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief.” (While the album sounds glorious turned up on a stereo, headphone listeners haven’t been forgotten.) “This is a low flying panic attack,” frontman Thom Yorke moans on the album opener “Burn the Witch”; that he’s doing so over lush strings only adds to the tension, underscoring the song’s message about inchoate anger boiling over into more sinister campaigns. The swooping background vocals that float around the gently picked guitars of “Present Tense” sound descended from heaven, contrasting sharply with Yorke’s singing about feeling unmoored by love (“As my world comes crashing down/ I’m dancing/ Freaking out, deaf, dumb and blind”) and only adding to the pervasive gloom. A Moon-Shaped Pool comes into sharpest relief when it’s at its most lush; “Ful Stop” opens with Yorke intoning, over and over, “You really messed up everything,” then somehow grows more harrowing from there, with careening strings and Yorke’s haunted moan besieging the insistently thrumming guitars that propel the song. The orchestrations on the brooding “Daydreaming” lurk in the background, only coming to the fore when Yorke’s backmasked vocal—a groaned, repeated “Half of my life” that sounds lifted from the subconscious—is brought into the mix. “True Love Waits,” a song that’s been kicking around the band’s catalog for the better part of two decades, closes the album. Pianos twinkle around Yorke’s voice, which sounds haunted as he enumerates fanciful manifestations of love (“true love lives on lollipops and crisps”); when he sighs, “Just don’t leave,” it feels like a hopeless plea, one drawn in stark contrast to the celestial atmosphere brought forth by the music. It’s jarring enough to call into question the title’s central conceit—what is “true love,” in a world where falsehoods lurk around every corner?—and the way its form follows its central message is a sterling example of why Radiohead has captured the imagination of so many listeners. A Moon-Shaped Pool isn’t much of a departure for Radiohead, ultimately. They’re casting about in their gloom, exploring the anxieties that come not just with the rupturing of personal connections, but the slow sinking of the structures that serve as those links’ support. But the way in which the band widened its sonic scope to fit the cinematic vista implied by Greenwood’s orchestrations makes it one of those surprise releases that will continue to sink in long after its trending-topic status has faded into the background. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"\\"A Moon-Shaped Pool\\" is a music album by the band Radiohead. It has beautiful music with different sounds and instruments that will make you feel different emotions. The singers and musicians in the band are very good at using their voices and instruments to tell stories through their songs.

Add 66*v to both sides of the equation: (-65*v + 66*v) + 5 = -66*v + 66*v This simplifies to: 1*v + 5 = 0 Step 2: Now isolate v by moving the constant to the other side of the equation. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 1*v = -5 Step 3: Lastly, divide by the coefficient of v to find the value of v. v = -5 / 1 v = -5 So the solution to the given equation, -65*v + 5 = -66*v, is v = -5."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The scene portrays a small, modest living room, with posters of cricket legends adorning the walls. As the commentators passionately describe an intense and nail-biting moment in the match, the young boy is transfixed, his eyes glued to the screen, clearly inspired and captivated by the sport. The camera would zoom in on Ravi's face, showing the burning desire within him to pursue cricket. With the background music building up, the scene will transition into a montage of young Ravi practicing relentlessly at a local ground, guided by his father, who supports and nurtures his passion. The montage would signify the beginning of Ravi Shastri's journey as one of India's iconic cricketers, who would eventually go on to become a successful coach and commentator. If a Bollywood movie were made on the life and career of Lalita Shastri: The opening scene could begin in the early 1930s in a rural setting in Prayagraj, India. A young Lalita is shown sitting under the shade of a tree, carving her name on banana leaves with a wooden stick, as she dreams of receiving an education despite being a girl surrounded by numerous challenges and societal restrictions. The camera could pan out to reveal her being scolded by an elder for wasting time and neglecting her household responsibilities. As a determined Lalita invites criticism for daring to be ambitious, the scene could contrastingly showcase her internal strength and resilience. As the opening sequence unfolds, a montage of key moments in Lalita Shastri's life would begin: the challenges of marrying at the age of 12, her struggles to fight superstitions, the difficulties she faces as the wife of Lal Bahadur Shastri, the 2nd Prime Minister of India, and her determination in pursuing her education.

Due to the multiple varieties of Sweet William and the different methods of growing them, you may hear conflicting information on when your flowers will grow and how long they will last. Biennial varieties bloom in their second year, and then die. Perennial varieties are supposed to regrow flowers year after year, but Sweet William perennials usually take two years to bloom and often die before they bloom a second time. Correct care of Sweet William perennials increases the chance of reseeding, as described in the section on caring for Sweet William. If you want your Sweet William to flower reliably within a year, acquire seedlings or adult plants in fall or spring. Confirm with the previous owner that the plant will bloom this year before you take it home, since some seedlings may not flower until their second year. Seeds that claim to be annuals (flowering and dying within one year) may or may not live up to the promise, depending on the variety and how it reacts to your local climate. Sweet William seeds are tough enough to survive most winters, and can be planted in fall or late spring to bloom 12 to 18 months later. If the plants have already started growing, or if you are concerned about a harsh winter, you may keep the plants in indoor pots, then transplant them outdoors in early spring. Once the seedlings are six to eight weeks old, they will transplant easily, with low risk of causing damage. Sweet Williams grow fastest in full sun, but are best suited for cool climates. Ideally, they should receive four to five hours of direct sunlight a day, but planting them in light shade is a wise option if you live in a hot climate (USDA zone 8 and above). Sweet William prefers loose, rich soil that is well draining. Water should drain quickly through the soil, and never pool on top of compact, hard soil. Optionally, you may churn up the existing soil and supplement it with potting soil to provide more nutrients. While you do not need to test the pH of your soil to successfully grow Sweet William, you may adjust the pH to slightly alkaline (approximately 6.75) if you already have a pH garden kit. Garden soil pH kits are available at garden supply stores or online. Again, this is not a mandatory tool for growing Sweet William, which are fairly adaptable when it comes to soil pH. Plant Sweet William in winter (hot climates only), spring, or summer (cool climates only). Place them on the surface and lightly cover them with 1/8 inch (0.6 cm) of soil, or dig a trench to this depth and refill after planting the seeds. Space the seeds 6 inches (15 cm) apart in ideal circumstances to reduce the chance of rot and disease transmission. If you do not have room to give them this much space, you may bunch them closer together, but take special care not to overwater in this case. If you are transplanting seedlings, simply transfer the soil around the roots into a hole twice as wide as the soil ball, then refill. Take care not to bury any part of the seedling's stem; the plant should be buried to the same level it was before. Sweet William seeds and seedlings benefit from an immediate watering after transplanting, but take care not to soak them with more water than can drain from the soil. Transplanted seedlings should be kept in moist but not soggy soil for a few days. Once they are established and recover from any withering that may occur, care for them as described in the care section.","output":"This article discusses the various factors that affect Sweet William growth, including biennial and perennial varieties, proper care for increased reseeding, ideal planting conditions, and transplanting tips to ensure healthy blooms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. It's daybreak on Sara Creek, a sleepy backwater that sits near Yorktown, Virginia, and empties into the Chesapeake. The early morning fog slowly lifts to reveal the ripples of water, the boats swaying, and a picturesque harbor. Tommy Leggett works to reduce polluted waters in Chesapeake Bay by growing oysters. Local watermen have been fishing around this area for generations. It's beginning to rain, and Tommy Leggett, a very proud and reserved waterman, combs over his white beard with his rough hands and prepares his boat, \\"Chesapeake Gold,\\" for what looks like a day of fishing out in the bay. \\"I've been a waterman for over 20 years,\\" he says. The difference now is Leggett doesn't fish anymore. He's an eco-conscious farmer and advocate who works on his sustainable oyster farm in the James River. He uses the term \\"aquaculture\\" to describe what he's doing here. \\"It refers to the husbandry, or farming, of aquatic species.\\" Leggett sells the oysters he harvests to local restaurants, growing about 100,000 a year as a part-time business. He makes sure he always has a product to replace the ones that he sells. He shares his expertise with other watermen, educating them about oyster aquaculture and the importance of sustainability.  Watch Leggett's efforts to save the bay ». Leggett also sells his fresh products to the area market. \\"Customers want to know if the oysters they are buying are local, which means they're fresher and taste better.\\" Waterman: Many foods rely on oysters. The Chesapeake Bay, which is the United States' largest estuary, covering more than 64,000 square miles and spanning across several states, has seen its fish, crab and oyster stocks dwindle, in part, because of pollution over the past several decades. \\"It was once said that the oyster stock in the Chesapeake Bay could have filtered the entire volume of the bay, in a single day,\\" says Leggett, who has been farming shellfish in the watershed since 1995. \\"Most people don't think of oysters having come from farms, and historically they haven't. They've been harvested from the wild fishery, which is supplied by Mother Nature.\\" That wild fishery, which still exists today, has seen its share of setbacks. From disease to overharvesting, Leggett knows what's at stake, and he's trying to get the message out. \\"Oysters filter the water, and they provide habitat for other species. There are so many food webs that depend and rely on oysters.\\" Not only does Leggett farm, he also works for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) as the Virginia oyster and fishery scientist. He is trying to do his part to reverse the trends of depleting oyster stocks. \\"If we don't restore oysters, we're not going to restore the Bay,\\" he says. He wants to make sure people understand what just one single oyster can do. \\"One oyster out here in one of our bags can filter as much as 50 gallons of water a day.\\" By filtering the water, this important shellfish can take away deadly pollutants that eventually could deplete the crab and fish stocks, which in turn can leave fishermen without work. Millions of oyster 'moms and dads' The CBF helps to grow millions of oysters that will eventually make their way to sanctuary reefs and will not be harvested. The oysters will reproduce, and make a home for thousands of sea critters that will eventually become food for larger animals. \\"Its all a giant food chain,\\" Leggett explains. Leggett works alongside Jackie Harmon as the CBF's sole employees at a worksite near the Institute of Marine Science in Hayes, Virginia. iReport.com: Show us the environment near you. \\"Our goal is to replenish oyster stocks,\\" Harmon says, \\"and by doing so, the oysters cannot only help filter water, but also help with shoreline erosion.\\" \\"It's a sustainable way for watermen of the Chesapeake to continue their livelihood as fishermen, in a more eco-friendly way.\\" Harmon also maintains an oyster farm on the weekend and hopes to one day sell her oysters at local farmers' markets. Leggett puts it this way: \\"All we're doing here is making moms and dads to help jump-start reefs throughout the Chesapeake.\\" Leggett and Harmon are optimistic. They believe current federal and state administrations are doing great things for the environment. They believe the CBF's message is being heard. However, a lot more needs to be done, Harmon says. \\"People are becoming more aware and want to take care of their environment, and they want to make it a better place for future generations,\\" she says. So as the land-based movement makes it apparent that buying local is the healthy way to live, seafood should be known in that same light. Leggett believes the Chesapeake Bay can produce the amount of seafood needed for the entire region and he thinks with careful oversight, the watersheds can be an abundant source for that local seafood industry again, just like it was decades ago.

Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Q: Background Paragraph: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Story: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  Question: Which city experienced the release of energy that was stored in the rocks less often?

The only detail provided is that \\"A bride is walking down the aisle towards the groom.\\" However, this information does not address whether the groom is blindfolded, if a stunt is being pulled, or whether the bride (his new wife) is watching this stunt and reacting to it with amusement. To further evaluate the given premise, we need more context and details regarding the situation at hand. If additional information reveals that a stunt is indeed taking place while the bride walks down the aisle, and all other aspects of the premise align, then we could conclude the premise is true. Conversely, should the additional information conflict with the premise in any way, the premise would not hold true. For instance, if the context described that as the bride approaches the groom, the groom's friends entertain him with a friendly prank which the bride finds amusing as she walks down the aisle, then the premise would be indeed true. However, if the bride is simply walking down the aisle, and no pranks or blindfolds are in the scene, then the premise would be false.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The riser is the small pipe that connects the sprinkler to the water line. The sprinkler head sits on the riser, which helps to regulate its up-and-down movement, rather than directly on the water line itself. To remove the sprinkler head, twist it to the left, or counterclockwise.  If the riser comes off with the sprinkler head, simply unscrew the two pieces and reattach the riser to the water line, being careful not to damage the threading of either piece in the process.  Be careful not to let too much dirt or debris fall into the open water line. It may help to cover it with a small cloth or plastic bag while you're working. To ensure that you're getting the type of head you need, take the old part to the store with you and purchase the same brand and model. If for some reason that's not an option, confirm that the new head has the same overall length and diameter as the old one.  Sprinkler heads come in several different sizes and lengths. If you get one that's too long, it will stick up high out of the grass after you install it. If it's too short, it may not reach the surface of your lawn from its seat on the water line. Consider shopping around for a head that features a removable flush cap rather than a traditional nozzle. Flush caps make it easy to clear dirt from the head following installation or use. Wind the tape neatly around the riser threads so that it forms a thin, uniform layer. Applying thread seal tape (also known as “Teflon tape”) will fill excess space between the riser and the body of the sprinkler head, creating a snug connection and decreasing the chances of future leaks.  You can find thread seal tape in the plumbing aisle of any hardware store or home improvement center. It's not necessary to use thread seal tape on polyethylene risers, as the soft plastic will typically bend and expand enough to form a secure seal on its own. Position the female end of the sprinkler head over the male end of the riser and twist it to the right (clockwise) to install it. Continue tightening the head by hand until it's nice and secure. Jiggle your new sprinkler head a few times to make sure it isn't loose. Any extra movement could be a sign of a poor connection. Rotate the sprinkler head until it's pointing toward your lawn, shrubs, of flower beds. The last thing you want is for your newly-installed sprinkler to water your car instead of your plants! There should be no need to adjust a radial sprinkler head. These send out water in a full 360-degree radius, ensuring even distribution over the area they're situated in.

Armed with her unwavering determination and backed by the entire nation, Tiffany has taken it upon herself to testify at a Congressional field hearing, implying that the U.S. Government must take appropriate steps to seek the truth behind this appalling incident. It was a day like any other when the Hartleys, together, decided to take a scenic trip to Falcon Lake, situated at the border of Texas and Mexico. Their memorable adventure took a unforeseen turn when David Hartley fell victim to a violent attack on the Mexican side of the lake. With no concrete evidence or explanation for the murder, David's body was never found, leaving his family and the entire nation with a heartache that still lingers today. Desperate for answers and eager to find justice for her beloved spouse, Tiffany Hartley has taken proactive measures to seek crucial information about the events that led to her husband's death. She filed a lawsuit to exert pressure on the authorities to release the facts surrounding David's murder and provide a clear picture of the attack that claimed his life.

Her presence alone sent a clear message to the U.S. Government that they must take appropriate measures to leave no stone unturned in this case. This is not only essential for the Hartley family, but also critical for ensuring the safety of American citizens who may find themselves in a similar situation along the border. Tiffany's quest for the truth has garnered widespread support from across the nation, as the Hartley family's plight has touched the hearts of millions. Compassionate citizens, inspired by Tiffany's determination, have rallied behind her and congregate on multiple online forums to continue the call for justice.

However, creating and maintaining a budget doesn't have to be a painful process. \\"If you ... start thinking about [budgeting] as a way to concisely create a better environment for yourself using your resources, it will get that much easier,\\" says Leslie Beck, a certified financial planner at Compass Wealth Management in Maplewood, N.J. Aside from maintaining a positive mindset, here are eight guidelines to help you successfully build and manage a budget: . While a budget can be a great tool for managing finances, it can quickly become overwhelming if it's overly detailed or idealistic. \\"There are things that you will likely sacrifice when budgeting, but it's very important to be realistic and understand your own habits,\\" says Kristin Wong, a contributor to the financial blog Get Rich Slowly. \\"If I have a problem area within my budget, like eating out or shopping, instead of trying to focus on everything and being too hard on myself, I pick that one area. The hardest part of a budget is sticking to it, so the easier you can make it, the better.\\" . Establish your budget for a time period that's long enough for you to see results. Stephen Lovell, a certified financial planner with Lovell Wealth Legacy in Walnut Creek, Calif., suggests budgeting for one year at a time. Budgeting month-to-month can accommodate everyday living expenses and bills, but a yearly budget can help you also plan for larger and more infrequent expenses, like income taxes or holiday presents. \\"You don't want things to slip away,\\" Lovell says. \\"It's better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.\\" . An emergency fund should be an essential component of every budget. It can help you finance unexpected expenses like medical bills so you don't have to pull income from other areas. \\"For example, allocate just as much to your savings as your emergency fund,\\" Wong says. \\"Once you have that, it's a lot easier to maintain the budget if a big expense springs up.\\" . Just as there are many ways to create a budget, there are also many ways to keep track of it. Whether it's through an online budgeting program like Mint or Quicken or on paper, stick to whatever works best for you. \\"Make sure you approach it in a manner that you are comfortable with,\\" Beck says. . Whether your budget affects your spouse, partner or roommate, communication about the established financial plan is crucial. \\"If you have two people who have really disjointed approaches to money, that's really going to be a problem in the long run,\\" Lovell says. %VIRTUAL-article-sponsoredlinks%\\"You need to be aware of the other person's attitudes about money and realize that your own aren't universal. Everyone needs to be on the same page and after the same goals for the budget to be successful.\\" Being open with those around you about your budget can also help you create a support system while you work to get your finances on track. \\"Talking to friends really helped me,\\" Wong says. \\"For example, even talking about it helped me when I was shopping with my mom. If I hadn't told her that I was on a strict budget, I probably would have spent more. She was there to hold me accountable.\\" . If over time, your budget results don't match your expectations or financial needs, you may assume the plan is wrong. However, it's likely that you simply uncovered unknown problem areas. \\"The things that pop up will actually let you know what the real norm is, so pay attention to what it is telling you,\\" Lovell says. \\"If you think, for instance, that you spend 12 percent of the family income on discretionary items, and you find after tracking for two months it's more like 28 percent, then something is off there.\\" . Following a budget typically means making cuts in less essential areas or eliminating some costs completely. However, if reducing the amount of money going out isn't doing enough, look for ways to increase the money coming in. \\"Take a part-time job or sell something that is just sitting in your closet taking up space,\\" Beck says. \\"People tend to think about just the one side of the equation when working to keep their budget on track, but there's another side that you can influence too, whether it's for a temporary or permanent basis.\\" . Making sacrifices is part of managing expenses, but if you set restrictions too high and too soon, you will be less likely to follow your budget over the long term. \\"If you enjoy a latte every day, don't go from 0 to 60 in terms of cutting back. Do it gradually,\\" Wong says. \\"Nobody wants to stick to a budget that cuts out everything fun in their life. If you keep failing at your budget, you are going to be discouraged and you're not going to want to do it anymore.\\" 8 Steps to Creating a Personal Budget Mobile-network companies do everything they can to pull you in the door, with smartphone offerings that often come with no upfront cost. Even the most popular models are available at big discounts, with most providers offering large subsidies in order to lock you into two-year contracts. Once you're locked in, though, costs for monthly data, text and voice plans can run well over 100 a month. That's fine if you actually use everything you're paying for, but many people don't. One Illinois consumer advocacy group found that state residents wasted as much as 1.4 billion by signing up for more-inclusive plans than they actually needed. Threats of overage fees lure subscribers into paying for more than they use. But look at your actual usage and then see if a cheaper plan would serve you just as well. Speaking of phone service ... Cellphone use has become nearly universal in the U.S., with a Pew Internet study finding that 91 percent of American adults have a cell phone. With plans that include unlimited or large amounts of minutes for use either locally or for long-distance calls, cellphones increasingly serve all the telephone needs people have. In that light, paying for a landline is of limited use. The main advantage is that landline phone service often continues to work during power outages when cellphone use fails, but an average landline bill of around 30 a month is a fairly hefty price to pay for that security. Like cellphone providers, cable companies have pushed customers into larger packages than many people want. Without a-la-carte options to pick and choose channels, many customers have to buy expensive tiered packages to get the channels they actually want. With the rise of streaming alternatives like Netflix ( ) and Hulu, some former cable customers have successfully cut the cord, replacing monthly cable bills of 100 or more with much lower subscription payments. Also, look into cheaper package options that cable operators must provide. They're often not advertised, but they can be much less expensive than typical standard cable packages. As summer heats up, cooling costs are on the rise, but one solution that covers both heating bills in winter and air-conditioning in summer is a programmable thermostat. By letting you tailor your energy use to times when you're actually at home, you can cut your total bills by 10 percent a year or more, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Energy. One downside of programmable thermostats in the past was that they didn't handle unexpected changes in plans very well. But advances in technology make it even easier to use programmable thermostats, with some devices linked to the Internet and controllable using a smartphone. That way, if you're going to be home an hour early, you can reset your thermostat remotely in advance. Mortgage rates have been on the rise recently, but some homeowners might still benefit from refinancing their home loans. Even with 30-year mortgages having gone up by more than a full percentage point in just a couple of months, rates of around 4.5 percent are still well below historical average levels. Refinancing comes with upfront costs, so it's important not just to look at monthly savings but also at how long you plan to live in your home and whether you can avoid or reduce costs associated with refinancing. Given how big a part of your overall budget your mortgage payment is, though, even small percentage savings can add up to a nice boost for your finances. Monthly bills can put a big weight on your shoulders. But by taking these simple steps and looking at other ways to trim your budget, you can go a long way toward escaping the bonds of paycheck-to-paycheck living and declaring your own financial independence from your bills.

Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"The child leaps across to land on the frog statue.\\", is the sentence \\"a child is sleeping\\" a true sentence? Options: [i] yes [ii] it is not possible to tell [iii] no","output":"[iii] no The sentence \\"The child leaps across to land on the frog statue\\" provides information about the child's actions at that moment. It clearly states that the child is engaged in some form of physical activity, specifically leaping, in order to land on a frog statue. This demonstrates that the child is not only awake but also actively participating in a playful or adventurous activity. In contrast, the sentence \\"a child is sleeping\\" implies that the child is in a state of rest and not engaged in any activity. Sleeping is a passive state and is the complete opposite of leaping or engaging in any kind of physical action. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentence \\"a child is sleeping\\" is not true based on the information given in the original sentence. It is important to note that the context provided in the original sentence is limited, and we are only able to assess the child's activity in that particular moment. We do not have information about what the child was doing before, after, or at any other time not specified in the sentence. However, based on the data provided, the answer to the multi-choice problem is option [iii] no, as the child's actions in the given sentence contradict the idea of the child sleeping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the Party, which promoted several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music that were published in Pravda under his name?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who joined the Party, which promoted several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music that were published in Pravda under his name, is Shostakovich."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: A middle Saxon pendant dating from 601–700 AD was discovered in a field in Little Thetford in 1952. This 3-centimetre (1.18 in) diameter by 1-centimetre (0.39 in) thick pendant, made from rock-crystal, gold, garnet, and amethyst coloured-glass, has been worked in a lathe. The workmanship is not of a high standard. Æthelberht of Kent was said to have built a church at Cratendune around 600 AD, about a mile from what is now Ely Cathedral. In 673 AD, Æthelthryth considered restoring this church, thought to have been destroyed by Penda of Mercia, but instead made what is now Ely Cathedral the site of her monastery. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery, used at some point between 410–1065 AD, was uncovered around 1945 near Little Thetford (52.376N, 0.2375E), and was thought to be this lost village of Cratendune. A deserted Saxon settlement, 410–1065 AD, examined in 1999 in Ely, may also be a candidate for this lost site of worship. Little Thetford means little public or people's ford—Old English lȳtel Thiutforda (c. 972) and Liteltedford [sic] (1086)—compare with Thetford, Norfolk—Old English Thēodford (late 9th century) and Tedfort (1086). The online Domesday Book records the settlement under the name Liteltetford [sic]. The first written evidence that Ely Abbey had inherited the Little Thetford lands was in the 12th-century chronicle, Liber Eliensis. The will of Ælfwaru (d. 1007), an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman, granted estates in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to the Abbey, which included \\"... that land at Thetford and fisheries around those marshes\\". In 1110, Hervey le Breton, Bishop of Ely, granted the manor to William Brito, his Archdeacon and also his nephew. Chapel Hill in the village, near the river, commemorates the site of Harrimere Chapel, used since 1381. Some of the stone from this chapel, dismantled in 1571, was used in the building of St George's Church. By 1539, the Little Thetford manor and its estates contained arable land, pasture, gardens, and orchards.

It is found in South America, in humid subtropical and tropical savanna climates in most of the countries east of the Andes: Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. Living in open woodland and other open forest habitats, it is mostly sedentary, though some populations may be migratory. The species, which is closely related to becards and tityras, was thought to be either a tyrant-flycatcher or cotinga, before it was placed in Tityridae. The bird is 12.5 to 13 cm (4.9–5.1 in) in length, with whitish undersides, a black crown, and grey-brown upperparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the females have duller upperparts. It feeds on insects in the foliage of trees and bushes, and sometimes on the ground. Nesting occurs in a simple cup nest placed in the fork of a tree. Both parents incubate the eggs and help feed the chicks. When the chicks fledge, the parents may divide up the brood to continue helping. The species is not common and little is known about it, but it is not considered in danger of extinction, and has been classified as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

This allows the horse enough room to trot comfortably while also preventing feelings of being out in the open, which may lead to attempts at escaping. If a specific ring is unavailable, creating a circle using bales of hay is a viable alternative. Furthermore, proper handling of the lunge rein is essential for both safety and practicality. To achieve this, take your time folding the rein in accordion-style pleats, which assists in preventing tangles and facilitates an easier grip. However, it's crucial to avoid wrapping the line around your hand as this could result in serious injury if the horse bolts and the rein pulls tightly.

George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

In the review, phrases like \\"presented at a low level\\" and \\"use a generic biology textbook like Life\\" also suggest a negative tone. Step 3: Consider any positive or neutral statements The review mentions alternative textbook suggestions (Lodish or Alberts' Molecular Biology of the Cell) as a better option for certain topics, which may be seen as neutral or informative. Step 4: Weigh the overall tone of the review The overall tone of the review is negative, as it criticizes the book's content and presentation. The title also supports this conclusion.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Redskins scored first when quarterback Todd Collins completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Todd Yoder for the only score of the second quarter. In the third quarter, Washington's fullback Mike Sellers scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Bears would reply with kicker Robbie Gould making a 30-yard field goal, and later quarterback Brian Griese completed a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian. In the fourth quarter, the Redskins responded with kicker Shaun Suisham kicking a 23-yard field goal. Later, Chicago made it closer as Gould kicked a 22-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Redskins increased their lead with Collins completing a 16-yard touchdown pass to running back Ladell Betts.

Question: If I wanted to get some oxygen, what will I get it from?  Choices:  - the sky - air - earth - space shuttle - water  The rationale to choose \\"air\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"You should choose \\"air\\" as the answer because the air in the Earth's atmosphere is the most accessible and abundant source of oxygen to sustain life. Here is the rationale explained in further detail: 1. Air: The Earth's atmosphere comprises roughly 21% oxygen, making it the best choice for obtaining oxygen. It is an essential component for humans and many other organisms to breathe and survive. Air is readily available on the surface of the Earth, and it is the primary source of oxygen for combustion, respiration, and other essential processes. 2. The Sky: Although the sky is technically the visual representation of the atmosphere above us, it does not refer to a specific source of oxygen. Choosing the sky would be too vague and not directly designate the source. 3. Earth: The term \\"Earth\\" in this context refers to the planet as a whole, including its physical and chemical composition. It doesn't specify a source of oxygen; instead, it merely indicates the world we live on. 4. Space Shuttle: A space shuttle is a vehicle used for space exploration and travel. While the shuttle has an oxygen supply for astronauts inside, it is not a primary or accessible source of oxygen for people on Earth. The space shuttle's oxygen supply comes from Earth and serves a limited quantity for specific purposes. 5. Water: Water is a chemical compound consisting of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O). Though it contains oxygen, it is not an accessible source for humans to breathe directly. Instead, oxygen from the air dissolves into water, and aquatic creatures such as fish utilize this dissolved oxygen. To separate the oxygen from water, you would need to apply a process such as electrolysis, which isn't feasible for daily oxygen consumption. In summary, the best choice for obtaining oxygen is from the air due to its accessibility, abundance, and the fact that it directly provides the oxygen required by living organisms for respiration and other vital processes."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The unfancied Central Americans booked their place in the last 16 and condemned Roy Hodgson’s side to an early exit following their 1-0 victory over Italy. England had been beaten 2-1 by the Italians in their Group C opener having allowed midfield playmaker Pirlo to dictate the contest. Circle of life: Costa Rica celebrate their 1-0 victory over Italy which sends them through to the last 16. Joy: Costa Rica have booked their place in the knockout rounds with a game to spare. Grounded: Andrea Pirlo did not inspire Italy as he had done against England. But Costa Rica subdued the Juventus man as Bryan Ruiz’s first-half header gave them an unlikely but deserved win. Henry also believes Costa Rica were good value for their success and drew comparisons with England’s failure to deal with Pirlo. ‘Costa Rica went forward and were pressing Pirlo. He never had one chance to turn and pick a pass. If you let Pirlo play he will expose you,’ said the BBC pundit. ‘They did not show Pirlo any respect during the game.’ Out: England will be heading home after the group stage. Flying Bryan: Fulham flop Bryan Ruiz celebrates the goal which gave Costa Rica a first-half lead. Verdict: Thierry Henry was full of praise for Costa Rica and critical of England. The former France international added: ‘I’m sure you didn’t know one player from Costa Rica. But if you have a good team, sometimes you don’t need names. ‘Costa Rica showed us that without the quality that England, Italy and Uruguay have, if you are well organised and have an idea of what you need to do then you can win.’ Fellow pundit Clarence Seedorf echoed Henry’s sentiment. ‘I think Costa Rica are better tactically (than England) because the (Italy) midfield was completely blocked,’ said the former Holland midfielder. ‘I agree with Thierry, it’s about having a team.’ Rio Ferdinand, meanwhile, says that England did not deserve to remain in the competition on the evidence of their defeats to Italy and Uruguay. ‘You have to earn the right to stay in a tournament and England have not done that,’ he said. ‘They have been a bit naïve in situations. When they got back into it against Uruguay at 1-1 we had a chance to get a point and say “right, we’re ready for the last game” and they didn’t.’ And ITV pundit Patrick Vieira said: ‘You can't say that England have played badly over the 2 games.

Detectives James 'Sonny' Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx), along with their partners Trudy Joplin (Naomie Harris), Larry Zito (Justin Theroux), and Gina Calabrese (Elizabeth Rodriguez), are mingling in the club, obviously waiting for something to happen or someone to arrive. While waiting, Sonny orders a drink and flirts with the bartender. Outside, two white Escalades pull up to the club and out jumps a 15-person entourage of thuggish men and scantily clad women, led by Neptune (Isaach De Bankole). The entourage skips the line, enters the club, and once inside Neptune approaches undercover Detective Stan Switek (Dominick Lombardozzi). It seems Neptune is a pimp, and he offers his ladies' services to Switek. Switek notices one of the prostitutes looks shaken and upset, but Neptune explains that she is feeling a little sick. Switek takes two of the prostitutes to an elevator, while Neptune and the thugs take the other ladies, including the upset prostitute, in the other direction. Tubbs sees the upset prostitute being handled roughly, and begins to follow her with Sonny right behind. One of the thugs get in Tubbs way, but Tubbs quickly dispatches him. Some more thugs begin attacking Tubbs and Sonny, but the detectives easily beat them up. However, Neptune and the upset prostitute make it to an exit. Meanwhile, Zito and Calabrese are using a cellphone to watch a live video of Switek undressing with the prostitutes.Sonny's pursuit is then interrupted by a phone call. Sonny walks out to a balcony to hear the call better. It turns out to be Alonzo Stevens (John Hawkes), a former informant who worked with Sonny and Tubbs. Hawkes is frantic and driving very fast. He tells Sonny that a deal is about to go very bad, but he didn't give up Sonny's name, and he wants him to look out for Lucianna, who is apparently Steven's wife.

Dequina is already awake. Holding a flashlight and a bucket, he is walking in the pre-dawn darkness along the shore of Old Poblacion Beach in the town of Maitum, Sarangani, in the far south of the Philippines. A few minutes later, he spots a patch of sand that appears to have been disturbed by a turtle. Dequina studies the area carefully, figuring out where the eggs have been buried, and then starts digging slowly. After clearing away several centimeters of sand, he uncovers a large group of eggs, roughly the size of ping-pong balls. He picks them up and puts them in the bucket. Dequina carries the eggs to his hatchery  , some 50 meters away from the seashore. The hatchery is really just a sandy patch of land under the coconut trees enclosed by a black fence. It is here that he buries the turtle eggs he has collected. Today, Dequina scoops a hole, puts the eggs in it, and covers them with sand. After 45 to 70 days, the eggs will hatch. Dequina will then carry the hatchlings to the shore, and release them into the sea. He admits to feeling sorrow as he sets the hatchlings free -- most are hunted down by natural predators, and just one percent survive to adulthood. According to the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), eight species of sea turtles face extinction, including four that come to the shores of Sarangani to lay their eggs -- the Hawksbill, Olive Ridley, Loggerhead and Green Turtles. After learning about their plight  , Dequina attended a DENR training session on turtle conservation and decided to take action. He helped the local government to set up the Pawikan Nesting Sanctuary next to his house in 2003. The hatchery drew the attention of the locals. \\"They started to change their attitudes towards sea turtles,\\" 52-year-old Dequina says. \\"If they see turtle eggs, they will either bring them to me or inform me of the nesting places.\\" Over the past ten years, more than 3,000 hatchlings have been released to the ocean.

Well, there are three super fun and helpful things you can do to improve your boxing skills: holding dumbbells, jumping rope, and sparring with a defensive focus. Let's learn about each of these activities so you can start practicing and become an amazing boxer! First, let's talk about using dumbbells. Dumbbells are like small weights you can hold in each hand. You might be thinking, \\"How can holding weights help me become a better boxer?\\" Well, when you hold dumbbells while you practice your punches and other boxing moves, it actually helps you build stronger muscles. This is very important because stronger muscles allow you to punch harder and faster, just like your favorite superheroes! Second, we have jumping rope. You might have seen people jumping rope at a park or even played with a jump rope during your playtime. Jumping rope is not only a fun game but also a great way to get better at boxing. When you jump rope, it helps you improve your footwork, which is how you move your feet while boxing. Good footwork is important so you can be quick on your feet and move smoothly around the boxing ring like a dancing butterfly! Lastly, we'll talk about sparring with a defensive focus. Sparring is like practicing boxing with a friend or a partner. It's important to remember that you're not trying to hurt each other in sparring, but just learning and having fun together. Now, there are two main parts of boxing – attacking your opponent (throwing punches) and defending yourself (protecting your face and body from punches). When you spar, it's good to focus on your defense so you can learn how to protect yourself better and not get hurt by your opponent's punches. So, there you have it! To become a fantastic boxer, remember to hold dumbbells while you practice your moves, jump rope every day, and spar with a focus on defense rather than attack. By doing these three fun and helpful activities, you'll see your boxing skills improve in no time. Good luck, and have a great time becoming the amazing boxer you've always wanted to be!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus. Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed. When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they have often difficulties. Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents. Although the stress is applied prenatally, the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life. Does it matter how long someone is exposed to stress to have an impact on their memory? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Yes, the duration of exposure to stress plays a significant role in determining the impact on memory. Research has established that both short-term and long-term exposure to stress can affect memory function in different ways. It is important to understand the different ways in which stress duration affects memory, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved. Short-term exposure to stress can result in impairment of memory functions due to the immediate effect on the hippocampus, a critical brain region associated with learning and memory. During a stressful event, the body releases cortisol, also known as the \\"stress hormone.\\" When cortisol levels increase, it interferes with the normal functioning of the hippocampus, disrupting processes such as memory consolidation and retrieval. This may lead to difficulties in retaining or recalling information, even if the exposure to stress was brief.  Long-term exposure to stress has a more pronounced effect on memory. Prolonged stress exposure can lead to lasting changes in the brain, such as reduced volume and impaired functioning of the hippocampus. In addition, long-term exposure to high levels of cortisol may cause damage to neurons in the hippocampus, which may contribute to memory deficits. Chronic stress can also disrupt neuroplasticity, which is essential for the formation of new memories and adaptation to new environments. Moreover, the prolonged impact of stress hormones and other factors such as inflammation can contribute to the development of cognitive decline and increase the risk for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Prenatal stress is another factor that can affect memory and learning capabilities. Prenatal stress may hinder the development of the hippocampus and impair the establishment of long-term potentiation, a process that strengthens the connections between neurons and is crucial for learning and memory formation. Exposure to prenatal stress may cause offspring to show increased levels of glucocorticoids when confronted with stress later in life, predisposing them to memory problems and cognitive deficits. In summary, both short-term and long-term exposure to stress can have deleterious effects on an individual's memory. The impact of stress on memory is determined by various factors, including the duration of stress exposure, the type of stressor, and its timing in an individual's life. It is crucial to manage stress effectively and develop coping strategies to minimize its impact on cognitive functions, such as memory and learning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said. But a recent Brookings Institution survey found Americans are far more welcoming of refugees than the billionaire candidate. Of those surveyed, 59 percent support accepting refugees, while 41 percent oppose it. Those views are split right down party lines, with just 38 percent of Republicans supporting taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared to 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. The Obama administration has set a goal of admitting as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees to the United States by the fall.Respondents of the surveys also were sharply divided on whether they would be willing to accept refugees from Syria in particular, with 61 percent of Republicans saying the U.S. should not accept Syrian refugees, compared to 27 percent of Democrats.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: what method of cookery is used to cook cakes and scones?","output":"The method of cookery used to cook cakes and scones is called baking. Baking is a dry-heat cooking method that uses an oven to transform dough or batter into baked goods, such as cakes, scones, bread, cookies, and pastries. The baking process relies on the oven's heat to cook the food evenly from all sides and produce a pleasant crust on the outside while ensuring a soft and moist interior. Specific temperatures and cooking times are required to achieve the desired final product. Here's a detailed explanation of the baking process used for cakes and scones: 1. Preparation: Before starting the baking process, it's vital to gather all the ingredients and equipment needed, like measuring cups, spoons, mixing bowls, a whisk or mixer, baking pans or trays, and a working oven. The ingredients typically include flour, sugar, butter or other fats, eggs, milk, baking powder or soda, and flavorings or other additives. Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature for optimal mixing and results. Each recipe may need unique preparation steps such as sifting flour, greasing and flouring the baking pan, and preheating the oven to a specific temperature. 2. Mixing: For both cakes and scones, mixing the ingredients properly is essential for the ideal texture and volume. Cakes usually follow either the creaming method or the all-in-one method. The creaming method involves beating the sugar and butter together until light and fluffy, then adding the eggs one by one, followed by the dry ingredients alternately with any wet ingredients. On the other hand, the all-in-one method requires all ingredients to be added to the bowl and mixed simultaneously. Scones follow the rubbing-in or biscuit method, which starts by mixing the dry ingredients and then rubbing the butter into the flour mixture with fingertips or a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs. The liquid ingredients are then added to form a slightly sticky dough. 3. Portioning and shaping: Once the batter or dough is mixed, cakes and scones require portioning and shaping before baking. For cakes, the batter is poured into the prepared pans, smooth the top, and tap the pan lightly against the countertop to remove air bubbles. Scones are typically shaped by lightly kneading the dough on a floured surface, then patting it flat and cutting round or triangular shapes using a knife or a cookie cutter. The scones can be placed on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat, spaced evenly apart to allow for expansion during baking. 4. Baking: The oven should be preheated to the correct temperature, typically between 325°F to 425°F (160°C to 220°C) depending on the specific recipe. Place the cake pan or scone-laden baking sheet into the oven and bake as per the recipe's instructions. Cakes generally take longer to bake than scones, usually between 20 minutes to an hour, while scones take around 12 to 25 minutes. The baked goods should be golden brown and well-risen when done. You can use a skewer or a toothpick to test for doneness. If it comes out clean or with a few crumbs, the cake or scone is ready. If it's wet or sticky, continue baking and test again after a few minutes. 5. Cooling and finishing: Remove the cakes or scones from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes in the pan or on the baking sheet. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, cakes can be frosted or decorated as desired, while scones can be served with clotted cream, butter, and jam. In conclusion, baking is the method of cookery used to cook cakes and scones, transforming their dough or batter into deliciously soft and moist baked goods. By following the appropriate preparation, mixing, portioning, baking, and cooling steps, you can achieve perfectly cooked cakes and scones every time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Even if you're not living with your husband when you seek legal council, documents can accidentally get sent to the wrong address. Your husband may also gain access to sensitive information through your email or social media accounts.  Set up a P.O Box and request any legal documents be sent to this address alone. You should set up a private e-mail account and channel all e-mail communications with your attorney through this account. Use a public computer to access this account as a controlling husband may set up SpyWare or other software on laptops and computers to gain access to your information.  Establish a safe place to keep copies of all important paperwork. This can be a trusted friend's house, a bank vault, or a secure hiding place in your own home.  Change all passwords to your social media sites. You do not want your husband accessing your social media as he might try to use things like Facebook to get damaging information or even modify your account in ways to harm you legally in a divorce. You should hire an attorney as soon as possible in any divorce but especially one where abuse is involved. Seek out an experienced attorney who has experience with these sorts of situations.  You can check credentials online by reading reviews and contacting past clients. Look for an attorney who has experience in divorce cases involving domestic abuse. This way, you'll be working with someone who understands the gravity of the situation and can help protect you.  If money is an issue, some attorneys might offer you a discounted rate if you explain the situation. You can also seek out loans from family members and friends. Custody arrangements can be a brutal part of any divorce. If abuse is involved, it's important you seek full custody of any children.  How to file a petition for full custody varies state by state. Talk to your attorney about the best options for your situation. In many states, regardless of whether abuse is an issue, an ex-spouse is entitled to visitation rights if he pays child support. This can be very frustrating for people trying to leave an abusive situation.  Document all abuse that happened, especially abuse that occurs in front of the children. This can help your case in a custody battle. Try to find people who've witnesses the abuse who would be willing to testify in trial.  Document everything you do for the kids to prove you're the primary caregiver. Photographs of you taking the kids to school, extracurriculars, and testimony from teachers, family members, and friends can help. You'll need a top notch legal team in order to fight an abuse case.

Write an article based on this summary: A primary school which was running out of teaching space has arrived at a novel solution - by turning a disused private jet into a new classroom. Article:","output":"Title: Primary School Transforms Disused Private Jet into Innovative Classroom Space Introduction: In an increasingly competitive and resource-limited educational environment, a primary school once challenged by their lack of teaching space has developed an exceptional solution. Through the innovative integration of a decommissioned private jet, the school administration was able to create additional classroom space. This fascinating and functional transformation has garnered attention and praise from the local community and the broader educational sphere. Step 1 - Identifying the Problem and Possible Solutions: The primary school, facing an urgent need for expanded teaching facilities, first set about identifying the issue before exploring and brainstorming potential alternatives. After ruling out conventional solutions, such as constructing additional rooms or renting off-site space, the school administration sought out more creative options to accommodate their growing student population. Step 2 - Discovering the Disused Jet and Assessing Potential: During their research into unique classroom spaces, the school came across a previously decommissioned private jet, grounded due to its age and subsequent ineligibility for continued operation in the air. Assessing the feasibility of the aircraft's interior spatial configuration, they found it to be a viable option for unconventional classroom conversion. Step 3 - Securing Permissions and Financing: To actualize their vision, the school officials liaised with local authorities to secure necessary permits and approvals for repurposing the retired aircraft. Once they had obtained legal clearance, the officials pursued funding avenues, successfully garnering support for this extraordinary endeavor. Step 4 - Presenting the Concept to Teachers and Parents: To ensure stakeholder buy-in, the school administration proposed the innovative classroom space idea to teachers and parents through meetings and presentations. A robust dialogue took place, allowing concerns and questions to be addressed, ultimately leading to positive support for the project. Step 5 - Refurbishing the Retired Aircraft: After securing the necessary resources and permissions, the school community collaborated with skilled professionals experienced in renovating retired aircraft. The aircraft was carefully refitted with familiar classroom elements, such as desks, chairs, and educational resources, to create a functional and inspiring learning environment. Step 6 - Integrating the New Classroom into the School Curriculum: Upon completing the jet-turned-classroom's renovation, the school incorporated the new-found space into their daily operations thoughtfully. Teachers and students embraced the unique learning environment, and the school was able to provide a quality education without compromising the individual attention required for each student. Conclusion: The transformation of a disused private jet into a classroom space typifies the potential for inventive solutions and resourceful thinking in education. The primary school's successful accomplishment demonstrates that a combination of ingenuity, creativity, and collaboration can help overcome spatial and resource limitations within the educational context. Additionally, it serves as an inspiring case study for other institutions facing similar challenges, showcasing the immense power of unconventional thinking and determination."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The album was dedicated to Field's niece.  A song he wrote for The Cockroaches, \\"Get Ready to Wiggle\\", inspired the band's name because they thought that wiggling described the way children dance.  Like a university assignment, they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album.

Answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Invictus Movie plot: On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela is released from Victor Verster Prison after having spent 27 years in jail. Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust. While attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that the blacks in the stadium are cheering for England, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, FranÃ§ois Pienaar, and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with FranÃ§ois a British poem, \\"Invictus\\", that had inspired him during his time in prison. FranÃ§ois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many blacks, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country. Things begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks...

Does the word \\"air\\" mean the same thing in \\"The house had a neglected air.\\" and \\"As he waited he could feel the air on his neck.\\"?","output":"No, the word \\"air\\" does not mean the same thing in the sentences \\"The house had a neglected air.\\" and \\"As he waited, he could feel the air on his neck.\\" In these contexts, \\"air\\" has two different meanings, which can be understood by examining the sentences and identifying the role that \\"air\\" plays in each. In the first sentence, \\"The house had a neglected air,\\" the word \\"air\\" is used as a noun, but it refers to the overall quality, character, or atmosphere of the house. In this sense, \\"air\\" connotes the general feeling, mood, or impression that the house gives off, which in this case is one of neglect. When you say that a place or object has a certain \\"air\\" about it, you are describing how it appears or is perceived by others based on its overall appearance, characteristics, or state. In the second sentence, \\"As he waited, he could feel the air on his neck,\\" the word \\"air\\" is also used as a noun but serves a different purpose than in the first sentence. Here, \\"air\\" refers to the natural, physical mixture of gases that compose the Earth's atmosphere, including oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other trace gases. In this context, \\"air\\" is something that can be felt and has physical properties, such as temperature, humidity, and movement (like a breeze or wind). This meaning of \\"air\\" is more literal and concrete, and relates to the sensation that the person experiences while waiting. In summary, the word \\"air\\" has a dual meaning in the English language and can refer to either the intangible atmosphere or mood of a place or object, or the tangible mixture of gases that make up the Earth's atmosphere. In the sentences provided, \\"air\\" is used in two different ways, highlighting its versatility and the importance of context in determining the intended meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Step 1: Analyze Sentence 1 Sentence 1 states that the speaker finds it amusing that more people don't get hurt. This implies that the speaker thinks it's unusual that not more people are hurt. Step 2: Analyze Sentence 2 Sentence 2 states that it is sad that many people get hurt. This shows empathy or concern by the speaker, implying that the speaker believes that a significant number of people get hurt and finds it regrettable.

Sentence 1 focuses on finding it funny how more people don't get hurt, whereas Sentence 2 focuses on the sadness caused by many people getting hurt. Step 4: Determine if the Second Sentence is Entailed by the First Sentence To entail a sentence, it means that one sentence logically implies the other sentence. In this case, the first sentence does not logically imply the second sentence.  The first sentence expresses amusement about the fact that not more people get hurt while the second sentence expresses sadness about many people getting hurt. The emotional response and focus on the sentences are different, illustrating the lack of logical entailment.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Among under-18s, the conception rate has halved in eight years, to 21 per 1,000 women in 2015, data from the Office for National Statistics shows. This may be due to young women staying in education for longer, improved access to contraceptives and the stigma of being a teenage mother. The biggest rise in conceptions was in women aged over 40, the ONS said. Since 1990, their rate has more than doubled to 15.1 per 1,000 women. The number of women deciding to have a baby in their late 30s has increased by similarly high levels, but the most popular age to become pregnant is still between the ages of 25 and 29 in England and Wales. However, the 30 to 34 age group is now close to catching them up with a continuous rise in conception rates since 1990. In 2015, there were 125 conceptions per 1,000 women in their early 30s compared to 127 among women in their late 20s. The ONS says more women are conceiving after the age of 30 because of an increasing desire to focus on a career and the rising costs of housing and bringing up children. It said uncertainty over job opportunities in the future could also be having an impact. More than half of all conceptions and births occurred outside marriage or civil partnerships in England and Wales in 2015. The areas with the highest conception rates among under-18s were Blackpool and Burnley. Overall, teenage conception rates in 2015 in England and Wales were the lowest recorded since statistics were first produced in 1969.","output":"The conception rate among under-18s has halved in eight years, while women aged over 40, in their late 30s, and early 30s have seen significant increases in conception rates, potentially due to factors such as career focus, housing costs, and access to contraceptives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option.

Marijuana is a kind of drug that some people use, but it can make people feel not so good and it is against the law in many countries, including China. Because Jaycee Chan did something wrong, he had to go to a place called jail. Jail is where people are sent when they do something bad, like breaking the law. It's not a fun place, and people who go to jail have to learn from their mistakes so that they don't do those things again. After 6 months of being in jail, Jaycee Chan was released, which means he was allowed to go back home. We hope that Jaycee has learned from his mistakes and won't use drugs like marijuana anymore. In this story, we learned that it's important to follow the rules and not to use things like drugs that can hurt us. And if we make mistakes, it's important to learn from them and be a better person in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article based on this summary: Bring your forms and proof of identification with you to the DMV. Pay the registration and title fees. Check your state’s regulations to see if you need insurance after registering. Renew your registration before it expires.","output":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to DMV Vehicle Registration and Titling Introduction A visit to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for vehicle registration can be a daunting task, especially for first-time car owners. However, by following a step-by-step process and understanding what to expect, the experience can become less stressful and more efficient. This article offers a comprehensive guide to the process, including what you need to bring, fees to expect, insurance regulations, and registration renewal.  Step 1: Bring the Necessary Forms and Proof of Identification Before you head to the DMV, ensure that you gather all the necessary documents and forms required for vehicle registration and titling. Below is a list of common documents needed: 1. Proof of identification (driver's license, state ID, or passport) 2. Vehicle title or Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin (MCO), if the vehicle is new and never titled 3. Vehicle registration application 4. Bill of sale and odometer disclosure statement, if required in your state 5. Emissions inspection certificate, if applicable 6. Proof of residency, if required Visit your state's DMV website to find specific requirements and to download any necessary forms. It's crucial to have all the correct documentation with you when visiting the DMV to avoid delays in your registration process. Step 2: Pay the Registration and Title Fees Once you have all your documents ready, visit your local DMV office to submit your application and pay the required fees. The fees typically depend on factors like the vehicle type, its weight, and the license plate type. Check your state's DMV website for the specific fee structure. Keep in mind that various accepted payment methods can include cash, check, or credit/debit card, depending on the DMV location. Be prepared to cover the fees using an accepted payment method to avoid potential inconvenience.  Step 3: Verify Insurance Requirements Insurance requirements vary by state, so it's essential to check your state's regulations before concluding your registration process. Many states require drivers to provide proof of insurance in order to register their car. This ensures that vehicles on the road are insured, minimizing the financial burden in case of an accident for all parties involved. To verify if you need insurance after registering, visit your state's DMV or insurance department website and review the specific requirements. If necessary, contact an insurance agent to secure coverage before completing your registration process. Step 4: Renew Your Registration Before It Expires Vehicle registration typically expires within one to two years, depending on your state regulations. Ensure that you renew your registration before it expires to avoid fines, penalties, or other inconveniences. Most states send renewal notices to drivers before expiration, but it's a good practice to keep track of your registration's expiry date and mark it on your calendar. Many DMVs now offer online services, which allow you to renew your registration quickly and conveniently. Conclusion While registering a vehicle at the DMV may initially appear complex, following a step-by-step approach can simplify the process. Be prepared with the required documentation, verify your state's insurance regulations, and stay on top of your registration renewal to ensure a smooth and efficient experience at the DMV."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 10 Super Mario fan theories that will make your mustache curl One rule about pop culture: If it exists, there's probably a fan theory about it. Super Mario Bros. is celebrating its 30th anniversary on Sept. 13, and not only have gamers been celebrating for the last three decades with serious gameplay, they've also been having some serious conversations about their favorite mustachioed plumber. While some of these ideas might be a little off the wall, others are just so weird, they make absolute sense. Here are just a few of the intense conspiracy theories on the Internet that fans have been tossing around their heads. Prepare to have your minds blown, Mario fans. 1. Mario and his friends are merely actors in a stage play.One of the most enduring fan theories online is that this entire video game world is a stage and Mario, Luigi and all their pals (and enemies) are merely players. Here are some pieces of evidence to support it: Recently, Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that this theory actually has some truth to it — so theory has become fact. 2. Princess Peach is Bowser Jr.'s mother.Little Bowser Jr.'s maternity seems to be a mystery among the online gamer forums — at least among those who don't immediate point to Princess Peach, who seems to be the most likely candidate. According to the Super Mario wiki, Junior is told by his father that Peach is his mother, but she is then kidnapped by \\"evil\\" Mario during Super Mario Sunshine. 3. Luigi is always with Mario because Mario keeps his strength in check.Poor Luigi. He's often brushed off as the weak, loser brother of the popular and strong Mario — but what if the guy in green was actually a a killing machine ready to rage at any moment? One fan theory on Reddit explains that Luigi may be stronger than we think, and staying close to Mario keeps him from Hulking out. The user explains: Luigi's only fear is that he may go too far one day and hurt people on accident due to his powers running rampant. A common trait we see is his extreme fear of ghosts. The reason behind that is because ghosts have been known to have the ability to possess living beings...By staying close to his brother, he doesn't have to worry about hurting people because he knows that Mario is the most skilled fighter in existence and the only person who can stop him. Mario is the polar opposite of Luigi: a mortal man without any notable powers. Despite that, Mario is capable of fighting against villains capable of destroying dimensions, and even defeating Luigi himself several times (Super Paper Mario) using nothing but his sheer battle skill. By staying next to his brother, Luigi can make sure that if one of his many odd powers goes out of control, or he turns evil, Mario will be close enough to stop him and limit the damage. More on this particular fan theory can be found here. 4. The whole series is just Princess Peach's propaganda.Mario and his friends are just puppets and Princess Peach is the puppet master. According to one Reddit user: However, have you ever asked yourself why we're being shown a Princess Peach Point of View of our favorite game? We always believed that Peach was telling the truth, and that she was the victim and Bowser was the villain...What if Princess Peach is really just using the Mario Games (which are plays) as [propaganda] to lead you to believe that Bowser is the villain, when in reality Peach is an evil dictator who wants to oppress the people of the Mushroom Kingdom. The post explains that gamers are never shown Bowser's point of view in the games and therefore are never given a complete picture of the politics of the Mushroom Kingdom. For all we know, Princess Peach could be manipulating Mario into thinking she is kidnapped to feed into her master plan. Pretty dark. 5. Super Mario Bros. is the only time Bowser truly kidnapped Princess Peach.Working under the assumption that Super Mario Bros. is real and not a play, the original game is the only actual time Bowser kidnapped Peach \\"in real life.\\" A user on Reddit explains that Super Mario Bros. 2 is actually a dream sequence, and therefore has \\"no bearing in the 'real' world.\\" And Super Mario Bros. 3 was a \\"play retelling (with embellishments) the events of Super Mario Bros. 1.\\" The user also goes into other games in the franchise: 6. Mario only went to the Mushroom Kingdom once — the rest is just him reliving his glory.Similar to the theory that Bowser only kidnapped Princess Peach once (in Super Mario Bros.), the same goes for Mario's trip to the Mushroom Kingdom. Since the original game was the only one to exist in \\"reality,\\" all of Mario's other adventures to to rescue the Princess from Bowser are simply the fevered dreams of a poor plumber reliving his glory days. The theorist on Reddit goes so far as to say Mario creates reality TV spin offs and grander marketing schemes on his whirlwind adventure, spinning greater tales and milking his fame for all it's worth. More of the user's theory can be found here. 7. Donkey Kong killed Mario and Luigi's father.One fan theory is so full of tragedy and family intrigue it would make Shakespeare blush. The Reddit user who poses this theory goes into extreme detail, but it boils down to the identity of the character, Jumpman, who looks suspiciously like Mario, in the Donkey Kong games. Here's how it works: Mario loves Princess Peach (at least at first) and lives in the Mushroom Kingdom, while Jumpman loves his wife Pauline and lives in New York City. While some have assumed Mario and Jumpman to be the same person, Mario would have had to have a major mid-life crisis to go from a New York City plumber to the savior of a magical kingdom — but what is to explain their resemblance? Jumpman is Mario and Luigi's dad. Honestly, they had to come from somewhere. Unfortunately, at the end of Donkey Kong Junior, Jumpman is the antagonist of Donkey Kong and dies at the end, killed by Donkey. In all these decades of gameplay, Mario has yet to seek revenge. The Reddit user goes into more depth on this theory here. 8. Dr. Mario is the third Mario brother.Mario has had plenty of odd jobs over the years, but something seems a little bit off about Doctor Mario from the Super Smash Bros. game. The Reddit user who introduced this theory wrote, \\"He has a similar moveset to Mario and Luigi, and while Luigi is a lighter and floatier comparison to Mario, DM is a heavier, harder hitting alternative. Doctor Mario's hair is also lighter than Mario's, taking an almost blonder or more auburn tint to the plumber's dark brown hair. Mario also seems to be more athletic than DM as he is faster and can wall jump, whereas the doctor can not.\\" It seems easy to believe that perhaps there are several Mario brothers, in several sizes, floating out there. More on this theory can be found on Reddit. 9. The coins are souls.Get ready for the most existential gameplay you've ever experienced. It turns out, every time you hit, smash, burn or generally destroy and object or enemy and you get a coin in return, what you're actually getting is that thing's soul. A user on Reddit wrote: The instruction manual for [Super Mario Bros. 1] states the the inhabitants of [Mushroom Kingdom] were turned into bricks (yes, the exact same ones that [Mario] smashed on his journey). If the bricks are [Mushroom Kingdom] residents, then how are there coins inside them. What if Mario was actually harvesting the souls of innocent toads? The theory goes into great detail on the many different and twisted ways Mario can harvest the souls of the dead for his profit. 10. Wario is a crazed Mario fan.Wario isn't such a bad guy. He just doesn't know how to process all these feelings of respect and admiration. Some evidence of Wario's devotion to Mario include: Wario's outfit is the a superfan equivalent of Mario's: overalls, white gloves, mustache and a cap with an upside down \\"M\\" (or \\"W,\\" however you want to spin it). In Super Mario Land 2, Wario lives in a castle with a statue of Mario in front. Of course, it's revealed that this place used to be Mario's own castle, but still, Wario doesn't seem to mind keeping it in tact. If that isn't love, we don't know what is. More details about Wario's deep obsession with Mario can be found here. So what's real and what's just a toad's fantasy? You decide.

Imagine you have your favorite toy. To find out if your toy is working perfectly, you need to play with it many times, right? So, to find out if a 6 sided die is fair or not, we have to roll it many, many times. If it's a fair die, you should see all the numbers, from 1 to 6, show up about the same number of times when you roll it a lot of times, like 600 times. Like, if you see number 1 about 100 times, number 2 also about 100 times and so on, then you can say 'yes, this die is fair.' But remember, it doesn't always have to be exactly the same number of times for each number - just close enough, because even with fair dice, sometimes you may get more of one number just by chance. So, it's like each number should get its chance to show up on the top when you roll the die, if the die is fair.  That's one of the simple solutions that is sound in terms of naive physics reasoning to find out if a 6 sided die is fair.

I have a new situation: In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment.  But I can use this background: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur.  What is an answer for this question: In which experiment the interior hydorxide ion would be exposed? The answer to this question is:","output":"In experiment B, the interior hydroxide ions would be exposed. When David used ground NaOH instead of solid pellets in experiment B, he significantly increased the surface area available for the reaction between NaOH and HCl gas. By grinding the solid NaOH pellet into smaller pieces, the interior hydroxide ions that were initially not exposed to the HCl gas molecules due to being inside the solid pellet structure were now available on the surface. In experiment A, where solid NaOH pellets were used, the reaction was relatively slow because only the surface hydroxide ions were exposed to the HCl gas, causing limited acid-base interactions with the gaseous HCl molecules. The interior hydroxide ions in the solid pellet remained inaccessible to the HCl gas and could not contribute to the reaction. However, in experiment B, the ground NaOH had a much larger surface area, allowing a greater number of hydroxide ions, including those from the interior of the original solid pellet, to react with the HCl gas molecules. This increased exposure led to a higher overall reaction rate and demonstrated the importance of surface area in driving the reaction between NaOH and HCl gas.  In conclusion, it was experiment B where the interior hydroxide ions were exposed, which significantly affected the reaction rate between NaOH and HCl gas as David observed in his chemistry lab experiments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When I go to the gym, there are \\"aerobic-classes  \\". We \\"warm up\\". We go \\"jogging.\\" In business, we attend a \\"meeting\\" and we have \\"good connections.\\" Other nations, like France, have taken action to protect their language from the influence of \\"Americanization\\".

If the government curbed the use of English words now, this could be considered by some as a return to that terrible past. Some German citizens are now trying to stop the use of English vocabulary in German. However, I think generally it is not a big deal to use some common English expressions as they often describe things more directly. But we should know that it is important to use English correctly. All too often, bad English is spoken or even written instead of good German. The proper use of the German language would be the better choice. However, there are some fields that require the use of English words, for example, in the high-tech communication and the Internet fields, there is no alternative to English. Also, I think sometimes I have to speak English when I introduce some scenic places to tourists. I think you have to find a balance and decide when it is better to use good German in place of bad English or when the use of correct English words is more suitable.

Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation. A:","output":"The last name of the person whose work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase is Williams."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A man and his girlfriend were married. It was a large celebration. All of their friends and family came to see the lovely ceremony. Everyone could tell that the love they had for each other was true. A few months later, the wife came to the husband with a piece of advice, \\"I read in a magazine, a while ago, about how we can strengthen our marriage,\\" she offered. \\"Each of us will write a list of the things that we find a bit annoying with the other person. Then, we can talk about how we can fix them together and make our lives happier together.\\" The husband agreed. So each of them tried to think of the things that annoyed them about the other and wrote down what they came up with. The next morning, at the breakfast table, they decided that they would go over their lists. \\"I'll start,\\" offered the wife. She took out her list. It had many items on it, enough to fill three pages. In fact, as she started reading the list of the little annoyances, she noticed that tears were starting to appear in her husband's eyes because he never thought that he had so many shortcomings. The wife continued to read until she had read all three pages to her husband. \\"Now, you read your list and then we'll talk about the things on both of our lists,\\" she said happily. Quietly the husband stated, \\"I don't have anything on my list. I think that you are perfect. I don't want you to change anything for me. You are lovely and wonderful and I wouldn't want to try and change anything about you.\\" The wife, touched by his honesty and the depth of his love for her and his acceptance of her, turned her head and wept. In life, there are enough times when we are disappointed, depressed and annoyed. We don't really have to go looking for them. We have a wonderful world that is full of beauty, light and promise. Why waste time in this world looking for the bad, disappointing or annoying when we can look around us and see the wonderful things before us? Options: A Because he had no courage to face his shortcomings. B Because he never thought he had so many annoyances in his wife's eyes. C Because he was sorry that he didn't find any annoyance about his wife. D Because he didn't think he deserved to have such a perfect wife. Answer: B Because he never thought he had so many annoyances in his wife's eyes. Question: The answer is:","output":"\\"Why did the husband start to tear up as his wife read out her list of little annoyances about him in their attempt to strengthen their marriage?\\"  Choices:  A - Because he had no courage to face his shortcomings.  B - Because he never thought he had so many annoyances in his wife's eyes.  C - Because he was sorry that he didn't find any annoyance about his wife.  D - Because he didn't think he deserved to have such a perfect wife.  The correct answer is B - Because he never thought he had so many annoyances in his wife's eyes, which suggests that the husband was surprised and upset to learn about the many aspects his wife found annoying about him, as he perhaps believed he was doing well in their relationship."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer the following question: Process:  - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion -   suppose during Thanksgiving happens, how will it affect less amino acid absorption.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"During Thanksgiving, people tend to consume large quantities of food, often including high-protein dishes such as turkey, ham, and various side dishes. The question asks how this might affect the absorption of amino acids in the body and which of the following perturbations might be supposed: directly impacting a step of the process, indirectly impacting a step of the process, or not impacting any step of the process. First, let's consider the process of digestion and absorption of amino acids: 1. Protein digestion begins in the stomach, where the enzyme pepsin breaks down proteins into smaller peptides. Hydrochloric acid in the stomach further helps to denature proteins and make them more accessible for digestion. 2. In the small intestine, the peptides are broken down into even smaller peptides and individual amino acids by various enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. 3. The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream by specialized transport proteins found on the surface of the small intestine cells. 4. Once in the bloodstream, the amino acids are distributed throughout the body for various functions, including protein synthesis, energy production, and other metabolic processes. Now, let's examine how the increased consumption of food during Thanksgiving might affect this process. - Directly impacting a step of the process: When a large amount of food is consumed, the stomach and intestines must work harder to process and break down the food. This increased workload could potentially slow down the digestion of proteins, leading to a temporary decrease in the rate at which amino acids are absorbed. However, the digestive system is generally efficient in handling varying amounts of dietary intake, and this direct impact may be minimal. - Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Overeating during Thanksgiving could lead to various indirect effects on amino acid absorption. For example, consuming large amounts of high-fat foods can delay gastric emptying, which in turn slows down the transit of food into the small intestine where amino acid absorption occurs. Additionally, the large consumption of carbohydrates and fats could lead to a competition for nutrients in the small intestine, which could affect the absorption of amino acids. - Not impacting any step of the process: Despite the increased intake of food during Thanksgiving, the digestive system is generally well-equipped to handle fluctuations in the consumption of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. The body can efficiently break down and absorb amino acids in varying quantities, and any temporary decreases in absorption rate due to overeating are likely to be minimal and short-lived. In conclusion, overeating during Thanksgiving could potentially have both direct and indirect impacts on amino acid absorption. However, these impacts might not be significant, as the digestive system can effectively handle changes in dietary intake. It is important to keep in mind that overeating is not healthy and moderation in food consumption is always recommended."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Wear army jackets or black band hoodies.\\"","output":"Title: The Essence of Rock 'n' Roll: An Ultimate Guide to Dressing like a Rockstar Introduction: The swell of electric guitar, the relentless beat of the drums, and the raw energy of a perfectly screeched high note—rock 'n' roll has been the pulse of counterculture for generations. From its inception, this genre of music has been celebrated not just for its sound, but also its style. Fashion, in particular, has played a pivotal role in the rock scene, and it goes way beyond ripped jeans and leather jackets. Today, we're going to dive into the details of crafting the perfect rock 'n' roll ensemble, taking cues from classic and contemporary rock styles. So, without further ado, let's get ready to unleash your inner rockstar. 1. The Classic Band T-Shirt: When it comes to dressing like a rockstar, it all begins with the essential t-shirt. Showcasing your musical taste is a no-brainer, and donning your favorite band's emblem on a stylish tee is a perfect way to spark conversation with fellow fans. As you assemble your collection, opt for tees with memorable album art, typography, or legendary concert posters. It's not just about the music; it's about embracing the art and culture surrounding it. 2. Tight Jeans – The Edgy Essential: Rock 'n' roll has no room for baggy pants, so make sure you invest in a few pairs of form-fitting jeans. This will give you the classic rockstar silhouette – long, lean, and ready to rock. Think black or dark indigo washes with frayed hems for that extra edge. Don't shy away from ripped jeans, either – they add a touch of rebelliousness and attitude that fits perfectly with the rock 'n' roll aesthetic. Bonus: tight jeans provide maximum freedom of movement for dancing, head banging, and those iconic high-kicks. 3. Appropriate Footwear – The Backbone of your Rockstar Look: While stiletto heels and flip-flops have their place, nothing echoes rock 'n' roll quite like the right pair of shoes. Chunky boots, be it combat or motorcycle styles, are classic staples of the rockstar wardrobe. Doc Martens, Converse, or Vans easily complement any outfit while providing comfort and structure for those long nights of waiting for an encore. 4. Jackets and Hoodies – A Touch of Effortless Cool: When the high-octane energy of a rock show dies down and you need to bundle up, invest in iconic pieces that scream rock 'n' roll. Army jackets and black band hoodies not only pay homage to the military-inspired looks of bands like The Clash and The Ramones, but they also allow you to show off your favorite band's logo in a functional and purposeful piece of clothing. Military jackets with patches are also a great addition, as they lend an air of personalized edge and nostalgia. 5. Accessorize with Attitude: Topping off your rockstar look is all about the details. Accessorize with a bevy of leather bracelets, studded belts, and layered necklaces to accentuate your style. Add a touch of personality by pinning badges and patches to your jackets and bags, representing your favorite bands. Finally, don't forget to let your hair speak volumes – a little bedhead, tousled curls, or colored streaks go a long way in completing your rock 'n' roll ensemble. Conclusion: Style is an integral part of the rock 'n' roll experience, and as a fan or aspiring musician, your fashion choices should reflect your passion for the sounds and culture of this beloved genre. Embrace the classics, but don't be afraid to put your personal touch on your wardrobe. Remember, rock 'n' roll is about self-expression, and that goes for clothing just as much as it does for the music. Always wear your band t-shirts, invest in tight jeans, stock up on appropriate footwear, and layer your army jackets and black band hoodies. Now, go out there, and carry on the legacy of your favorite rock heroes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Why does a salt solution conduct electricity? Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking about the properties of a salt solution and why it has the ability to conduct electricity. Step 2: Research the topic. To answer this question, we need knowledge about salt solutions and their properties, particularly regarding the conduction of electricity. Step 3: Formulate a coherent and accurate answer. A salt solution, such as a sodium chloride (table salt) solution, conducts electricity because it is an electrolyte. When salt dissolves in water, it dissociates into its positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-). These ions can move freely in the solution, allowing them to carry and transfer electrical charges. Question 2: How much salt is in a bag of saline solution? Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking about the quantity of salt present in a bag of saline solution. Step 2: Gather information about common saline solution concentrations. A typical saline solution used in medical settings has a concentration of 0.9% sodium chloride, which means it contains 0.9 grams of salt per 100 milliliters of water. Step 3: Find the volume of the saline solution bag. The volume of the saline solution bag is not provided in the question. Common sizes for saline solution bags in medical settings are 250 mL, 500 mL, and 1000 mL. Step 4: Calculate the amount of salt. If we assume a 0.9% sodium chloride solution, then we can calculate the amount of salt in the bag as follows: For a 250 mL bag: - 0.9 g of salt per 100 mL of solution - (0.9 g/100 mL) * 250 mL = 2.25 grams of salt For a 500 mL bag: - (0.9 g/100 mL) * 500 mL = 4.5 grams of salt For a 1000 mL (1 L) bag: - (0.9 g/100 mL) * 1000 mL = 9 grams of salt Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking about the reason why a salt solution conducts electricity, while Question 2 is asking about the amount of salt contained in a bag of saline solution. They are related and both concern salt solutions, but they are asking for different pieces of information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a premise: In the end--although you'll hear plenty of people tell you that this is an old-fashioned idea--a stock's price is a mechanism for discounting the future. Here is a hypothesis: They wanted it to grow not decrease in value. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, it is important to analyze both statements in detail and understand the underlying concepts.  Premise: \\"In the end--although you'll hear plenty of people tell you that this is an old-fashioned idea--a stock's price is a mechanism for discounting the future.\\" This statement suggests that the price of a stock reflects the present value of all future cash flows generated by the company. It indicates that the stock's price considers the earnings potential and other relevant factors that affect a company's performance and growth in the long-term. However, it also introduces a notion that this idea may be considered \\"old-fashioned,\\" which implies that there could be alternative ways of determining a stock's price or that some people might not agree with this approach. Hypothesis: \\"They wanted it to grow not decrease in value.\\" This hypothesis suggests that investors desire their stock value to appreciate rather than depreciate. In the context of investments, this makes sense as appreciation in the stock value allows investors to profit from their initial investment. The hypothesis does not specifically discuss the premise's \\"old-fashioned idea,\\" but it can be assumed that investors generally expect their stocks to grow in value based on the company's future potential and earnings. Now, to consider whether the premise, if true, implies the truth of the hypothesis, let's break it down: 1. If the stock's price is indeed a mechanism for discounting the future (the premise), it means that the stock's current value is based on an estimation of all its future cash flows.  2. Investors want the stock value to grow, not decrease (the hypothesis); this suggests that they are expecting the company to generate positive cash flows in the future, leading to an increase in the stock's value. Given these two points, if we accept the premise as true, then it does provide support for the hypothesis. Stocks are priced based on future cash flows, and investors want their investments to increase in value. Assuming the premise is accurate, and stocks indeed discount the future, investors look for companies with strong growth potential and earnings in the future, which consequently results in stock value growth, as desired.  However, it is important to note that the premise may not be universally true, as stated in its acknowledgment of being perceived as \\"old-fashioned.\\" Variations in investor sentiment, market movements, and external factors can significantly influence the stock's price, casting doubt on the premise's applicability in every situation. Therefore, while the premise does provide support for the hypothesis, it may be insufficient to guarantee the hypothesis's truth in all contexts and situations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the best way to: To cool off an item faster when using ice,","output":"The best way to cool off an item faster when using ice involves maximizing the contact between the item and the ice, as well as utilizing other techniques to speed up the heat transfer process. Below are several methods and tips for cooling off an item faster using ice: 1. Crushed ice: Using crushed ice instead of ice cubes can be more effective when you need to cool off an item quickly. The smaller pieces of ice have a greater surface area, which allows for more contact between the ice and the item. This larger contact area results in a faster heat exchange, causing the item to cool down more rapidly. 2. Ice bath: Fill a container with ice, then add water to create an ice bath. Water will fill in the gaps between the ice pieces, creating more contact points for the heat transfer. When you immerse the item in this mixture, it will cool down at a faster rate compared to just placing it onto the ice. 3. Salted ice bath: Adding salt to an ice bath can further accelerate the cooling process. Salt lowers the freezing point of water, which causes the ice to melt at a faster rate. This melting process absorbs heat, thus speeding up the heat transfer from the item to the ice mixture. 4. Stirring or agitating the item: If possible, continuously stir or agitate the item while it is in contact with the ice. This action will ensure that the warmer parts of the item make contact with the ice, boosting the overall cooling efficiency. 5. Pre-chilled container: Place the ice and the item inside a pre-chilled container. By pre-chilling the container, you eliminate the need for the ice to spend energy cooling down the container, allowing it to focus its cooling effect on the item. 6. Insulation: Insulate the outer surface of the container holding the ice and the item. Insulation will help maintain the cold temperature inside the container and prevent external heat from entering, enabling a more effective cooling process. 7. Increase surface area: If possible, increase the surface area of the item that will be in contact with the ice. More surface area means more space for heat exchange, resulting in a faster cooling process. 8. Use multiple cooling containers: If the item to be cooled is large, consider using multiple cooling containers filled with ice. Place the item at different angles in each container to ensure that the cold is evenly distributed throughout the item. 9. Optimal ice-to-item ratio: Ensure that there is enough ice to cool down the item effectively. As a general rule, a 1:1 ratio between ice and the item should suffice. If the item you are cooling is larger or has a high heat capacity, you may need to use more ice. 10. Temperature check: Periodically check the temperature of the item to track the cooling progress. This will help you determine whether additional ice or adjustments to the method are needed. By implementing these tips and methods, you can maximize the efficiency of using ice to cool an item down more quickly. Remember that the key is to enhance contact between the ice and the item, utilize the salted ice bath if needed, and use proper insulation to maintain the cold temperature inside the cooling container."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who was perhaps not the only king of the West Saxons at the time, whos viceroy is said to have constructed Chisbury Camp, and to have founded Abingdon Abbey?","output":"The king you are referring to is King Cædwalla of Wessex, who ruled from 685–688 AD. Although he was not the only king of the West Saxons at the time, he is particularly known for his viceroy, St. Æthelwold, who is said to have constructed Chisbury Camp and founded Abingdon Abbey.  King Cædwalla was an Anglo-Saxon ruler who played a crucial role in consolidating the kingdom of Wessex against rival powers like Mercia and Sussex. During his reign, he expanded Wessex's territories to include the Isle of Wight and parts of Sussex, Surrey, and Kent. St. Æthelwold, the viceroy under King Cædwalla, was responsible for many important initiatives in the region, including the construction of the Chisbury Camp, an Iron Age hillfort located in Wiltshire. He also founded Abingdon Abbey in Oxfordshire, an influential Benedictine monastery, around 676 AD. Æthelwold was a leading figure in the religious and cultural life of the region, and he played a significant role in bringing stability and prosperity to the kingdom. In conclusion, King Cædwalla of Wessex, although perhaps not the only king of the West Saxons at the time, is notable for his accomplishments, expansion of the kingdom, and association with his viceroy, St. Æthelwold, who constructed Chisbury Camp and founded Abingdon Abbey."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell! And when April 2 rolls around every year, I begin living those last 30 days of her life over again. I thought that after the third time in 2017 that I was about ready to let it go.

Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage. That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. \\"Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies,\\" said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md. It \\"may well be\\" that theft of business data is \\"as serious a strategic threat to national security\\" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs. The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Oldman was born in New Cross, London, the son of Leonard Bertram Oldman (1921-1985), a former sailor who also worked as a welder, and Kathleen (nee Cheriton; born 1919). He has stated that Leonard was an alcoholic who left the family when Oldman was seven years old. Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving school at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop. He was a pianist as a child, and later a singer, but gave up his musical aspirations to pursue an acting career after seeing Malcolm McDowell's performance in the 1971 film The Raging Moon. Oldman was charged with drunk driving in 1991 after a night out in Los Angeles with actor Kiefer Sutherland. A deputy city attorney stated that Oldman's blood alcohol content was found to be more than twice California's limit for legal intoxication.  Some media outlets reported that Oldman was unhappy with The Contender (2000) because DreamWorks had edited the film to reflect pro-Democratic leanings, stirring controversy. The claims were declared \\"sloppy sensationalism\\" by Oldman's manager, Urbanski, who said that Oldman was \\"the least political person he knew\\", that \\"neither he nor Oldman had made the statements attributed to them,\\" that they had \\"produced the film every last cut and frame,\\" and that \\"DreamWorks did not influence the final cut or have anything to do with it.\\" It has been suggested that Oldman was blacklisted in Hollywood for several years as a result.  In an interview in the July/August 2014 issue of Playboy magazine while promoting Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Oldman criticized what he saw as excessive political correctness in American media and the entertainment industry's own discriminating hypocrisy, and argued in support of former controversial celebrities Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin. He stressed that he did not relate with most of their viewpoints, but regarding the former, agreed, \\"Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews\\" (referring to Hollywood). After criticism from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Oldman apologised to them in an open letter. ADL director Abraham Foxman acknowledged that Oldman was remorseful, but felt his letter was insufficient and asked for \\"a little more introspection, a little more understanding and a little more education\\". Oldman then made a public apology on the 25 June edition of late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he stressed that he was \\"profoundly sorry\\" for his \\"insensitive, pernicious and ill-informed\\" remarks. What about relationship or career problems that may have caused controversies?","output":"Gary Oldman had some troubles in his life. He was charged with drunk driving in 1991 and it caused a problem. Also, some people thought he was unhappy with a movie called The Contender, but his manager said that wasn't true. Later, he talked about some controversial celebrities and it upset some people, so he had to say sorry for what he said. These things caused some controversies in his relationships and career."},{"instruction":"Question: Information:  - Clergy are some of the main and important formal leaders within certain religions. The roles and functions of clergy vary in different religious traditions but these usually involve presiding over specific rituals and teaching their religion's doctrines and practices. Some of the terms used for individual clergy are \\"cleric\\", \\"clergyman\\", \\"clergywoman\\", \\"clergyperson\\" and \\"churchman\\".  - A Scottish clan (from Gaelic \\"\\", \\"children\\") is a kinship group among the Scottish people. Clans give a sense of shared identity and descent to members, and in modern times have an official structure recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon, which regulates Scottish heraldry and coats of arms. Most clans have their own tartan patterns, usually dating from the 19th century, which members may incorporate into kilts or other clothing.  - An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \\"chieftain\\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\\"hertig\\"/\\"hertug\\"/\\"hertog\\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \\"jarl\\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \\"jarl\\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \\"Earl/Count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era.  - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile).  - James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose (1612  21 May 1650) was a Scottish nobleman, poet and soldier, who initially joined the Covenanters in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, but subsequently supported King Charles I as the English Civil War developed. From 1644 to 1646, and again in 1650, he fought a civil war in Scotland on behalf of the King and is generally referred to in Scotland as simply \\"the Great Montrose\\".  - The Battle of Kilsyth was an engagement of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms which took place on 15 August 1645 at Kilsyth. Despite a numerical disadvantage, the battle was another victory for the Royalist general Montrose over the Covenanters, and marked the end of William Baillie's pursuit of the Royalist forces.  - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish.  - The Wars of the Three Kingdoms, sometimes known as the British Civil Wars, formed an intertwined series of conflicts that took place in England, Ireland and Scotland between 1639 and 1651. The English Civil War proper has become the best-known of these conflicts and included the execution of the kingdoms' monarch, Charles I, by the English parliament in 1649.  - Sir Lachlan Maclean , 1st Baronet of Morvern , ( circa 1600 - 1649 ) the 17th Clan Chief of Clan Maclean . Lachlan was granted his Baronet title by Charles I and he became the Clan Chief on the death of his brother in 1626 . He fought as a Royalist under James Graham , 1st Marquess of Montrose during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms at the Battle of Inverlochy , Battle of Auldearn and Battle of Kilsyth . From 1628 to 1633 he sat in the Parliament of Scotland as shire commissioner for Tarbert . From his rule onward , all Maclean clan chiefs are successive Baronets of Movern .  - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament  taxation, legislation and policy-making  but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.  - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame.  - Clan MacLean (Scottish Gaelic: \\"\\" ) is a Highland Scottish clan. They are one of the oldest clans in the Highlands and owned large tracts of land in Argyll as well as the Inner Hebrides. Many early MacLeans became famous for their honour, strength and courage in battle. They were involved in clan skirmishes with the Mackinnons, Camerons, MacDonalds and Campbells, as well as all of the Jacobite risings.  - A burgh was an autonomous corporate entity in Scotland and Northern England, usually a town, or toun in Scots. This type of administrative division existed from the 12th century, when King David I created the first royal burghs. Burgh status was broadly analogous to borough status, found in the rest of the United Kingdom. Following local government reorganization in 1975 the title of \\"royal burgh\\" remains in use in many towns, but now has little more than ceremonial value.  - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.  - The Kingdom of Scotland was a state in northwest Europe traditionally said to have been founded in 843, which joined with the Kingdom of England to form a unified Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Its territories expanded and shrank, but it came to occupy the northern third of the island of Great Britain, sharing a land border to the south with the Kingdom of England. It suffered many invasions by the English, but under Robert I it fought a successful war of independence and remained a distinct state in the late Middle Ages. In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King of England, joining Scotland with England in a personal union. In 1707, the two kingdoms were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain under the terms of the Acts of Union. From the final capture of the Royal Burgh of Berwick by the Kingdom of England in 1482 (following the annexation of the Northern Isles from the Kingdom of Norway in 1472) the territory of the Kingdom of Scotland corresponded to that of modern-day Scotland, bounded by the North Sea to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the southwest.  - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city.

We have: -44 * w + 4 * w = 9 * w First, we want to put all the \\"w\\" terms on one side of the equation. To do that, we can look at the two items on the left side: -44 * w and 4 * w -44 * w means we have \\"-44 w's\\". And 4 * w means we have \\"4 w's\\". If we add them together, it's like having -44 apples and then adding 4 apples, so we get: -44 * w + 4 * w = -40 * w, which is the same as -40w. So the left side of the equation now becomes -40w. Now our equation looks like this: -40 * w = 9 * w Next, we want to get all the \\"w\\" terms on one side of the equation. To do that, let's move the 9 * w (which is the same as 9w) from the right side to the left side. We can do this by subtracting 9 * w from both sides of the equation: -40 * w - 9 * w = 9 * w - 9 * w This simplifies to: -49 * w = 0, which is the same as -49w = 0. Now, to find the value of \\"w\\", we want to get \\"w\\" all by itself by dividing both sides of the equation by -49: -49w / -49 = 0 / -49 This simplifies to: w = 0 So, the answer is w = 0. This means that in the equation -44 * w + 4 * w = 9 * w, when w is 0, the equation is true!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Are they unluckier than cats of other colors? Many people in Western countries think so. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge  cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey  on the Internet. There were 49 statements   matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured   cats are friendly, tri-coloured   cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation  . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that. Although people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats. \\"You can't judge a cat by its colour, because it's the personality of the cat, not the colour, that will let you know if the cat is right for you,\\" Cathy Marden, a scientist said.

Answer the following question: This article: If the pigeon became alert, it would often stretch out its head and neck in line with its body and tail, then nod its head in a circular pattern. When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised its wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it.The passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other to access water, and if necessary, the species could alight on open water to drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long a wild pigeon lived.The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of pre-Columbian forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by white oaks. This species germinated in the fall, therefore making its seeds almost useless as a food source during the spring breeding season, while red oaks produced acorns during the spring, which were devoured by the pigeons. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed consumption may have contributed to the modern dominance of red oaks. Due to the immense amount of dung present at roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the accumulation of flammable debris (such as limbs broken from trees and foliage killed by excrement) at these sites may have increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires, which would have favored fire-tolerant species, such as bur oaks, black oaks, and white oaks over less fire-tolerant species, such as red oaks, thus helping to... contains an answer for the question: What was the youngest Martha could have been when she died?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The youngest Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, could have been when she died is 17 years old, as it was stated that she was \\"at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died.\\" The article doesn't provide any information that suggests she could have been younger than 17 at her death. This indicates that Martha lived a relatively long life compared to many pigeon species, with the potential of having been almost three decades old when she passed away.

Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting 250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroyed their milk truck, which drenched them and disabled their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him. Deciding that the Bandit is too egotistical and hard to manage, they hire Cledus \\"Snowman\\" Snow (Jerry Reed) as his replacement. Accepting the offer, Cledus parks his Peterbilt 359 and climbs behind the wheel of a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.He later picks up Dusty (Colleen Camp), who quits her job as a \\"bookkeeper\\" for a used car dealership, but not before attempting to wreck her boss' business (a seedy used car dealership) by badmouthing him in the middle of broadcasting a live TV commercial.The scene of Cledus picking up Dusty in the middle of the road is almost an exact repeat of how Bo picked up Frog in the 1977 film. Cledus manages to catch up with Buford on an interstate, where he then lassoes Buford's fish off of the Justices' police cruiser; Buford needs the fish to retrieve his 250,000.

A search of the surrounding area revealed no evidence of a Hittite settlement dating back to the time of the statues.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced Wednesday that he is suspending his presidential campaign, bringing an end to a bid that began with aspirations of expanding the libertarian base that his father, Ron Paul, built into a powerful national coalition. \\"It's been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the White House,\\" Paul said in a statement. \\"Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of Liberty.\\" The low-key senator, as apt to quote a philosopher as to quote Pink Floyd, struggled in a year dominated by hard-line outsiders such as Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and businessman Donald Trump. In a call with reporters, his campaign strategists bemoaned that the mogul had sucked the \\"oxygen\\" out of the race, and admitted hat his non-interventionist views on foreign policy were not embraced by Republicans as terrorism and unrest raged abroad. Paul, a first-time candidate for national office, also found it difficult to persuade the supporters of his father — a former congressman from Texas who sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012 — to back him with enthusiasm. Although popular among libertarians, purists in that wing of the conservative movement questioned whether Paul was too mainstream. “His decision to move to the middle and support a number of moderate Republicans in the 2014 elections, that sent us a real signal about the application of his ideology,” said Drew Ivers, Ron Paul’s 2012 Iowa chairman, who did not endorse Rand Paul. “He muddled on his message, tried to get the left, and I told him it would backfire… I just saw someone trying to do too much and be too many things to too many people. His name is Paul, I told him. You can’t defy gravity.\\" [Rand Paul's ideological heritage is his greatest asset — and his biggest challenge] Paul, a 53-year-old ophthalmologist, was elected to the Senate in 2010 as part of the GOP's tea party wave. He will return to his work in the chamber and to his Senate reelection campaign, where he remains a top target of Democrats as they try to retake the majority this year. According to Paul's campaign aides, the candidate decided to drop out after a disappointing finish in Monday's Iowa caucuses, where his father had placed a strong third in 2012. Thanks again to the people of Iowa. It was great getting to meet you & I am especially grateful for the enthusiasm of students! Fight on! — Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) February 2, 2016 Over the past day, Paul began to inform his key aides and donors that he would leave the race, then returned to Washington, D.C. to resume his work in the Senate. In his statement, Paul expressed confidence that his campaign, while unsuccessful, offered Republicans an alternative by focusing on issues he thinks are crucial to attracting minorities and young people to the party. \\"Across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government, privacy, criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy,\\" he said. \\"Brushfires of Liberty were ignited, and those will carry on, as will I. Although, today I will suspend my campaign for President, the fight is far from over, I will continue to carry the torch for Liberty in the United States Senate and I look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of Kentucky for another term.\\" Longtime associates of Ron Paul framed Rand Paul’s departure from the race as a stumble rather than a crippling defeat in the younger Paul’s career — and for their movement. Paul ally Trygve Olson said that libertarians and other conservatives probably would consider Paul in a future presidential cycle that was less crowded and driven by a celebrity front-runner. “Rand Paul remains the best advocate those conservative have in the United States Senate,” Olson said. “Even if he didn’t have the kind of success he wanted, he’s an important voice on a whole set of issues. Assuming he’s reelected, he will continue to be that voice and be the person putting them at the center of the radar.” Olson said Ron Paul’s star turn in the 2008 race was driven as much by the national political environment as it was by the candidate’s performance. “When Ron ran then, he was able to tap into the angst that was out there about the war and foreign policy,” he said. Paul's method of campaigning echoed his father's. He favored small gatherings where he could make lengthy speeches and preferred orations that cited Montesquieu. While he was accessible to the media, he did not relish banter with reporters or the glad-handing demands of the campaign. Some candidates used every spare minute to meet potential voters; reporters who ran into Paul at an airport usually caught him reading a book. But his ambitions were grand. Two years ago, he became the first Republican to assemble a network in all 50 states as a precursor to a presidential run — a sign that he was looking to build a coalition that wasn't as ad hoc as his father's. Magazine covers proclaimed Paul to be one of the party’s brightest and most interesting voices — a hemp-wearing, curly-haired maverick, who could, in his words, spread the Republican message to \\"voters with tattoos and without tattoos.\\" He began courting Wall Street titans and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who had donated to the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, attending elite conclaves in Utah and elsewhere. His pitch combined his antagonism toward the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs with what he called “crunchy conservatism,” a prioritization of drug-sentencing reform, the environment and civil liberties. In 2013, as the Republican Party was casting about for new leadership, Paul filibustered the nomination of the new FBI director and only quit the floor ten and a half hours later, after the White House put out a letter clarifying whether American citizens could be targeted by drone attacks. He got mixed reviews for a speech to black students at Howard University, but then, hunkering down, he reached out to black political leaders in Kentucky and began talking more about criminal justice reform. Republican Party chapters tapped Paul to open offices in poverty-stricken parts of Louisville, Chicago, and Detroit. “I’ve been to Ferguson, and I've been to the south side of Chicago,” he told a largely white audience of Republicans in Baltimore, after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody sparked two days of rioting. \\"Until we've walked in someone else's shoes, we shouldn't say we can't understand the anger of people.\\" Few Republicans talked like that. In early 2014, Paul was consistently leading — or close to leading — national polls. A CNN/ORC International survey in March of that year found that 16 percent of Republicans and independents who lean Republican were likely to support the senator, putting him at the front of the Republican field, and giving him unusually strong support from black voters. At home in Kentucky, Paul loaned strategist-turned-nephew-in-law Jesse Benton to the re-election campaign of now-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, signaling that he had bridged a gap between the \\"liberty movement\\" and the Republican elite. Some pundits, like The Atlantic's Peter Beinart, suggested that Paul was really the frontrunner to win a changing party's nomination and challenge presumed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on traditionally liberal turf. “Right now I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton in certain purple states,” Paul told Fox News host Megyn Kelly shortly before his launch. “I'm the only one that also scores above all the other Republicans in whether or not I can beat her.” Paul’s May 2015 announcement tour started in Lousiville, and swept into the first four primary states, finding sizable crowds. His campaign, led by Republican strategist Chip Englander, had a plan to finish at least second or third in all of the early states, then take advantage of the long-stirring Paul organizations in the Midwest and Mountain West to collect delegates. That never happened. Donald Trump, who entered the primary one month after Paul, charged ahead in polls and captured the “outsider” energy Paul had claimed for years. Weak poll numbers scared off possible megadonors who had donated to Ron Paul, like the venture capitalist Peter Thiel. In August, right before the first Republican presidential debate, Benton was indicted over a 2012 scheme to flip an Iowa state senator's endorsement to Ron Paul. (Benton was later acquitted.) Another, more strategic challenge came from a man Paul had endorsed in his bid for a Senate seat in Texas: Ted Cruz. Talking openly about winning the “liberty lane” of the Republican primary, Cruz lobbied supporters of Ron Paul to switch over and back a better-funded campaign. As he struggled, Paul barely concealed his resentment for Cruz's wrangling. Paul secured a standalone vote on defunding Planned Parenthood; Cruz vacuumed up the attention by calling to cut funds in the must-pass spending bill. Paul won a New Hampshire straw poll of libertarian-leaning Republicans; Cruz claimed victory with his own vote count. Paul told audiences that Cruz had been “nowhere to be found” on a vote to audit the Federal Reserve; voters did not seem to care. This past Sunday, when the elder Paul joined his son for a “revolution”-themed rally on the University of Iowa campus, most of the press seats were empty; only C-Span bothered to film a teleprompter-delivered closing message. Paul's early exit calmed Republicans who worried that his race for the White House was risking control of his Senate seat, which is on the 2016 ballot. Paul had worked hard to protect his day job, paying 250,000 from his campaign account to fund a March presidential caucus, which he now will not contest. At the “revolution” rally, early Paul endorser Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said he was likely to pay for a poll of the state, expecting it to show that Paul could campaign through the next primaries without any risk to his Senate seat. In a Wednesday radio interview, Cruz praised Paul and reminded listeners that he had always been an ally of the liberty movement. Speaking to reporters in New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a staunch critic of Paul’s foreign policy positions, commended his Senate colleague for running “a good race” and wished him luck in his reelection bid. “Rand is someone I disagree with on a lot of issues, but as I said the other night at the debate ... he believes strongly in what he stands for, and I respect that,” said Rubio. “He’s a true believer on issues of limited government and the liberty issues and I respect it for him for it.\\" Asked if he planned to ask Paul for his endorsement, Rubio replied: “Sure. I mean, I’d love to have Rand’s support.” In a conference call with reporters Wednesday morning, Paul strategist Doug Stafford reiterated that the senator would make no endorsements -- not even of Cruz. It did not matter especially that Paul had endorsed the Texan in his upstart 2012 Senate primary. \\"Rand endorsed many people for Senate,\\" he said.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Ethan Hunt is alerted by the IMF that someone has used his identity to assist bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich to enter the United States, only to kill him in a subsequent plane crash. Nekhorvich, an old friend of Ethan, had forewarned the IMF of his arrival, planning to deliver to them a new bioweapon, Chimera, and its cure, Bellerophon. He was forced to develop these by Biocyte Pharmaceuticals. IMF determines that rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose is responsible. IMF assigns Ethan to recover the virus and its cure. It also insists that he recruits Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in Seville, Spain. Later, Ethan finds out that she is Ambrose's ex-girlfriend. After recruiting Nyah, Ethan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in Sydney, Australia, where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah gets close to Ambrose and begins to learn about the Chimera virus. At a horse racing event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues. He then blackmails McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals video footage and transfers it to Ethan. Ethan's team learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's red blood cells. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. The IMF team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, they learn that the only samples of Bellerophon were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus (which Nekhorvich injected himself with). As a result, Ambrose forced McCloy to exchange a sample of the virus for a sample of Bellerophon. The team break into Biocyte to destroy the virus. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing his plan. Ambrose captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one...

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Rebuilding England's Cricket Team: A New Era Under Alastair Cook Alastair Cook is set to embark on an era-defining journey as he looks to rebuild his own team instead of leading the side initially assembled by Andrew Strauss. Despite a recent Ashes loss being Cook's maiden Test series defeat in six as captain, it is evident that the English cricket team needs a fresh perspective and rejuvenation. Team director Andy Flower's backing and support for Cook as the leader of the squad demonstrates the faith the management has placed in his abilities to take the team forward into a new era of success. The Ashes series, the pinnacle contest between England and Australia, has always been a significant event for any England captain. Cook's first Test series defeat as a captain came as a shock to many, yet it opened a window of opportunity for building a competitive and formidable team molded in his own image. The importance of having a captain, who is not only an exceptional tactician but also a leader who instills confidence and trust in his players, cannot be understated. Cook's strengths have been well-documented throughout his career. An astute tactical mind, an unwavering commitment to his team, and an ability to remain calm under pressure all contribute to his laudable captaincy style. The support he has received from team director Andy Flower, in addition to the selection committee's backing, signals that there is a collective belief in Cook's potential to steer the team towards a bright and successful future. Flower's insistence that Cook is the right man to lead England forward is a testament to this viewpoint. As the cricketing world adapts to different formats and evolves, it is essential that England takes the necessary steps to keep up with the ever-growing competitiveness of the sport. In this context, the consideration of Stuart Broad as a possible successor in the Twenty20 format can be seen as an intelligent move. Broad's impressive leadership qualities, coupled with his experience and expertise in the shorter formats of the game, makes him an ideal candidate to take over the reins from Cook if necessary. The transition from Strauss's team to Cook's is vital for the continuous growth of the English cricket team. With the backing of Flower and Broad waiting in the wings as a potential successor, it is crucial that Cook now takes full advantage of the opportunity to leave his own mark as captain. The expectations are undoubtedly high, and it remains to be seen how effectively Cook can remodel the team in his own image, thus ushering in a new era of success for England. By entrusting Cook with this responsibility, the team's management has demonstrated their belief in his skills as a leader and a potential harbinger of change. Under Cook's guidance, a rejuvenated and competitive English team could emerge, one that not only honors its past successes but forges a new path towards triumph. It is time for Cook to take the helm, to build and nurture his side, and ultimately, to make his own indelible mark on the cricketing world."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Во-первых, нужно уметь правильно выбирать вино. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Firstly, it is important to know how to choose the right wine. This statement in Russian emphasizes the significance of selecting the appropriate wine for a particular occasion, meal, or personal preference. Possessing the ability to choose the right wine can enhance the overall experience and impression of both the wine itself and the event it is accompanying. To choose the right wine, one should consider various factors, such as taste preference, food pairing, wine origin, and budget. Start by determining your preferred taste, such as sweet, dry, fruity, or bold. If you are uncertain about your preferences, consider trying a wine tasting or asking for recommendations from friends or wine experts. Next, take into account the food you will be serving or consuming alongside the wine. Pairings can significantly impact the enjoyment of both the wine and the meal. As a general rule, lighter wines, such as white or rosé wines, complement lighter dishes, while fuller-bodied red wines go well with heartier, meat-based meals. However, this is not a strict rule, and individual preferences play a significant role. Investigate the wine’s origin, as the geographical location where it is grown and produced can impact the flavor profile and quality of the wine. Unique soil types, climates, and grape varieties contribute to regional differences in taste and texture. You may find that certain regions or countries produce wines that you particularly enjoy. Lastly, establish a budget to guide your wine selection. It is possible to find great-tasting wines at various price points, so don't assume that spending more is always necessary. However, investing in higher-quality wines for special occasions or for pairing with a gourmet meal can heighten the experience. Conduct research, ask for recommendations, and be open to trying new wines to build your knowledge and ensure you make the right choice for every situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Needing money, he reluctantly takes the job of adapting a trashy novel for the screen. Knowing that this is obviously below him, instead of reading the thing he instead asks a naive, celebrity-obsessed girl (who has read the book) he meets at a restaurant to give him a synopsis, which she does enthusiastically. He sends her home with cab money and is abruptly woken up at 5:00 the next morning by a police officer; the girl was found murdered, and Dix was the last person to see her alive. Given his violent past and what appears to be apathy towards her death, he is the most logical suspect until his beautiful neighbor Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) gives him an alibi (though the audience is never quite sure if she is telling the truth or lies because of her attraction to Dix). There is an undeniable connection between Laurel and Dix, and despite her guarded demeanor and his deep internal demons, the two fall madly in love and for a while they enjoy the happiest time of their lives. Meanwhile, the murder investigation continues and Dix is still the most likely suspect. This puts immense strain on their relationship. The pressure on him is mounting, and as he begins to become increasingly impatient and irritable, this makes her back away from him. Sensing this, he is so frightened he'll lose Laurel, he clings ever more tightly to her, which appears controlling and frightens her. After hearing she didn't tell him about going down to the police station to answer more questions, he storms off and almost kills an innocent bystander, and is only stopped by Laurel's plea. After that incident, Laurel begins to truly doubt Dix's innocence. Dix senses this and from the strain of the accusation, the novel and his fears of losing Laurel, his violence has started up again.

Context: Voting is underway in the southern U.S. state of Alabama in a tightly contested Senate election between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore, a campaign roiled by charges from women who accused Moore of sexual misconduct four decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Tuesday's special election was being watched nationally, both as an indicator of how midterm congressional elections might play out next November and also as a barometer of President Donald Trump's political clout. Trump endorsed Moore, who has denied the women's allegations, and called for the defeat of Jones, whom he said would be a political \\"puppet\\" of liberal Democratic lawmakers in Washington. The election winner will serve the last three years of the seat left vacant by Jeff Sessions when he joined Trump's Cabinet as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement position. If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda. Pre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones. No Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \\"a distinguished Republican\\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14. Moore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won. Question: What state did Moore run in for Senate? Answer: Answer:","output":"Moore ran for Senate in the state of Alabama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A couple are celebrating the miraculous recovery of their 10 month old son after he and his twin brother were born extremely prematurely at 23 weeks. Deborah Jackson, 32 and partner Nick Filby, 28, from Harlow, Essex, find their happiness is tainted by heartache as they grieve the tragic death of their second son. Despite the best efforts of medical teams, baby Owen only survived an hour after his delivery, while his brother Ollie fought for his life in hospital for six months. Alongside Deborah and Nick's joy at Ollie's recovery and homecoming, they are still grieving the tragic lost of his twin brother Owen. When Deborah, a trained nanny and Nick, a plumber, were told that she was expecting twins eight weeks into her pregnancy they were thrilled. But at 23 weeks Deborah suffered a heavy bleed with stomach pains and a worried Nick rushed her to hospital where she was told she was in labour. She says: ‘I knew already it was one week before the abortion limit. Ollie (right) and Owen (left) were born at just 23 weeks weighing 1lb 10grams and 1lb respectively. ‘I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I pleaded with doctors to do everything they could for the twins as long as it wouldn’t be cruel.’ Their local hospital wasn’t specialist enough, and Deborah was transferred to a specialist premature baby unit at another hospital, an hour away. There, they told her that her twin boys had little chance of survival and that even if they did survive they’d be severally mentally and physically handicapped. She says: ‘They told us to prepare for the worst, it was the most terrifying moment of our lives.’ Deborah’s labour lasted four agonising hours. Little Owen arrived first, weighing 1lb but he was breach and badly damaged. His shoulders and back had been broken during his birth and his skin was bruised. Deborah with Ollie, who was critically ill at birth, requiring a total of 19 blood transfusions to keep him alive. The second twin Ollie was born a few minutes later, just 10g bigger. He cried, and was taken straight off to an incubator. Deborah says: ‘This should have been the happiest time of our lives - instead me and Nick never felt so afraid. ‘I sat up in bed holding little Owen. We sang Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to him and I held him close so he’d feel the warmth of my skin. The family held a small service for baby Owen. ‘When his body went cold after an hour and a half we knew he’d gone. ‘Afterwards I didn’t know how I could carry on.  But like Nick I knew we needed to stay strong for Ollie.’ Ollie was critically ill, suffering a brain bleed hours after birth and doctors told the couple to prepare to say goodbye. However miraculously Ollie survived his first few days. Then the medical team discovered a hole in his heart and although the doctors managed to close it with medication, Ollie suffered a massive bleed on his lungs - nearly drowning him in his own blood. Again Deborah and Nick prepared to say goodbye but Ollie fought back, again and again as he suffered a further two major bleeds. Things looked their bleakest when he caught pneumonia and his lungs collapsed. Then he caught a stomach infection, which causes the intestines to die. Doctors pumped his tiny body with steroids and antibiotics. Then when his retinas started to detach he needed injections in his eyes to save his sight. Deborah says: ‘Doctors said they were running out of options. But we’d already lost one baby, we couldn’t bare the thought of losing Ollie too.  We were living on a knife edge. ‘But despite needing 19 blood transfusions Ollie kept going. We spent every second we could by his incubator praying he’d pull through.’ In the meantime the couple had to bury their other son Owen. Ollie was in hospital for over 6 months, recovering from several potentially fatal conditions. Deborah says: ‘We held a small service with close family. It felt like my heart was breaking as they took his tiny coffin away to be buried. ‘. After the funeral the couple were back at the hospital by Ollie’s side. ‘He’d cheated death so many times it was as though he had a guardian angel. ‘Maybe it was his brother, there was no other explanation. ‘And the doctors couldn’t explain it.  They told us that they’d never seen anything like it.’ Although Ollie, now 10 months, still requires oxygen to assist with his breathing, his brain functions are normal and he constantly improving. For weeks Ollie battled for his life, surprising them each time they thought he couldn’t take anymore, and slowly he began to put on weight and stabilise. Finally after six months he was allowed home, and since, he’s been going from strength to strength. ‘Deborah says: ‘He’s doing so well, he’s turned into a right little tinker and now weighs nearly a stone! ‘All his brain functions are fine now and although he still needs help with his breathing and has an oxygen canister at home, it’s constantly improving each time he goes for his check ups. ‘One day we’ll sit him down and tell him about his big brother Owen. ‘We’re proud of him too and grateful for the brief moment we had him in our lives.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"A couple, Deborah Jackson and Nick Filby, are celebrating the miraculous recovery of their 10-month-old son, Ollie, after he and his twin brother Owen were born extremely prematurely at 23 weeks.

It seems to be especially popular with stayathome parents who would rather teach their children themselves in the privacy of their own homes. In order to homeschool your children,you will need to know the basics of how to do this,and like everything,there are steps you will need to follow. Homeschooling is legal in all fifty states. The first step is to check with your state's Board of Education to find out what the legal requirements are and what you will need to do in order to  _ them. Next,you will need to determine whether or not you want your children to follow a structured curriculum. Most parents use this system to ensure that their children will study every subject that a child who goes to a private or public school would. Homeschooling can not only provide your children with the essential learning of the basic subjects of reading,writing,and arithmetic,but it can also help your children to master muchneeded life skills. These skills can range from learning how to do the cleaning to balancing his or her own checkbook. They are skills that your child will need to know so that he or she can take care of themselves later on in life. One last point about homeschooling:The question of interaction and socialization is most always brought up in the question on whether or not a child should be homeschooled. Public schooling is automatically thought to be a good place for a child to learn how to get along with his or her peers. While some social skills probably can be learned in this type of environment,peer pressure is always a constant concern for parents. Fortunately,parents who homeschool can teach their children moral values as well as the right way to get along with other people.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less conservation occurs happens, how will it affect more scouring of rocks occurs.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose suggests that if less conservation occurs, it will lead to more scouring of rocks. To evaluate whether this perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the process, we first need to look at the various steps involved in the formation of acid rain and analyze the consequences of reducing conservation efforts. 1. Formation of acidic chemicals in the atmosphere: Acid rain is produced when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These chemicals react with moisture, sunlight, and other atmospheric gases to produce sulfuric and nitric acids. 2. Fall onto the ground: When acidified rain, snow, or fog falls to the ground, it increases the acidity of soil, water bodies, and affects the ecosystems that rely on them. 3. Scouring rocks: The increased acidity in precipitation erodes and weathers rocks and other terrestrial surfaces. This can eventually lead to exposed rock surfaces that are more susceptible to further erosion and degradation. 4. Destruction of vegetation: Acid rain can harm forests, crops, and other plant life, leading to decreased vegetation cover in affected areas. It can damage the leaves and roots of plants, inhibit growth, decrease nutrient availability, and impact the soil's structure and function. 5. Altered surrounding environment: The consequences of fewer plants, increased erosion, and altered soil composition can result in an array of ecological effects, from increased sedimentation and water pollution to destabilized ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity. Now let's consider the perturbation hypothesis, which states that less conservation would result in more scouring of rocks. To analyze the possible impact of this perturbation, we should examine how conservation efforts can influence the acid rain process: - Conservation efforts that target the reduction of SO2 and NOx emissions can play a crucial role in mitigating the formation of acid rain. For instance, implementing pollution control measures on vehicles and power plants or promoting clean energy sources can significantly reduce these emissions. If less conservation occurs, the emissions of these acidic chemicals and subsequent formation of acid rain will likely increase. - Other forms of conservation efforts, like reforestation programs, aim to restore the vegetation destroyed by acid rain. If such efforts decrease, it would lead to the more vulnerable land being exposed and susceptible to the erosive actions of acid rain. This could result in more scouring of rocks in the long run, as you suggest in your hypothesis. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis you propose, where less conservation causes more scouring of rocks, could hold merit. Reduced conservation would likely increase the emissions of harmful chemicals like SO2 and NOx, leading to more acid rain formation. This would have a direct impact on the scouring of rocks, as well as an indirect consequence due to the destruction of vegetation and alterations in the surrounding environment. Long-term implications of increased scouring of rocks may include significant changes or degradations to ecosystems and negative impacts on the environment and biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The eviction process begins with the provision of proper notice to the tenant that demands that the tenant vacate the leased premises within a specific period of time. Click here to access the different notice of eviction forms that have been approved by the Florida Supreme Court. The different types of notice required includes:  3-day notices are for nonpayment of rent. The amount due on the face of the 3-day notice cannot be greater than the total amount of past due rent. You must accept rent if submitted before the end of the 3-day notice period, and once accepted you can no longer pursue eviction. 7-day curative or non-curative notice is provided for evictions related to lease or law violations. 15-day prior notice  is required for the termination of a month-to-month tenancy. Miami Beach has a special law requiring a 30-day notice if you have an oral month to month agreement or if the lease is written but does not contain a lease duration. Some lease terms contain instructions for the service of notice and other processes to the tenant. If the lease is silent, you can serve notice by handing a copy of the notice to an adult occupant of the leased premises.  The notice can also be securely posted to the door of the premises. Service of notice via mail is also possible, and you should make sure to send the mail certified in order to have documentation of receipt that can be presented to the court. Notice begins to toll on the first full day following delivery of notice, and expires at midnight on the last number of days given for notice, excluding weekends and holidays. If the tenant has not paid rent during the notice period, or has not remedied the lease violation underlying the eviction, you can proceed with filing an eviction complaint. A completed eviction packet will contain your completed eviction complaint, five copies of the lease agreement and notice provided to the tenant, as well as a pre-stamped envelope that is addressed to all occupants/tenants. Have the complaint notarized and file it at the clerk's office, or swear to it in front of a clerk and pay the relevant complaint filing fee. In most counties the filing fee is 185. After filing your eviction complaint and paying the filing fees,  you will be provided with a service of summons that must be provided to the tenant along with a copy of the eviction packet. Service can be conducted by a private process server or by a county sheriff, who will confirm in writing that the notice, was delivered.  Tenants have 5 days to answer an eviction summons. If the tenant answers and pays the rent, the landlord must contact the court to schedule a hearing. File a motion with the clerk seeking a default judgment if the tenant fails to answer the summons. Attend court on the hearing date and make sure to take all notice receipts with you. Go to your courtroom and answer all questions presented by the judge, and then wait for the court to enter a judgment. If the judge sides with you, the court will order the sheriff to evict the tenant in 24 hours. The sheriff will serve what is called a writ of possession, which the landlord must pay for, ordering the tenant to vacate the property. Alternatively, file a motion for default with the court if the tenant answered the summons, but failed to show up at the court hearing.","output":"The eviction process is a way for a landlord to tell a tenant they need to leave their home. Here are the main parts: 1. The landlord gives the tenant a notice, which is like a warning, telling them to fix a problem or leave their home within a certain number of days. 2. If the tenant doesn't fix the problem or leave, the landlord can go to court and ask for help to make the tenant leave. 3. The tenant gets a letter saying they have to go to court and explain why they don't think they should be evicted. 4. If the tenant doesn't go to court or the judge agrees with the landlord, the police can help make the tenant leave their home.

Write a summary based on this article: Image copyright Twitter/@rahimaxarsenal      Doubt has been cast on a key document at the centre of a corruption inquiry in Pakistan because of the use of a particular typeface. And Twitter users are poking fun at Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz using the hashtag #FontGate.      The social media campaign is just the latest twist in a story that has gripped Pakistanis.      The ongoing corruption inquiry is part of the fallout from last year's Panama Paper leaks, which has consistently been one of the most discussed topics online in Pakistan. It could end with the disqualification of the prime minister, although he has claimed the allegations are politically motivated.      Documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists last year revealed details about offshore companies connected to a number of high profile political figures - including Sharif. He wasn't actually named himself in the leaks - but a number of his children were linked to offshore firms that owned four luxury central London flats.      Opposition figures in Pakistan allege the money used to buy the flats was earned through corruption and a team of investigators including members of the country's intelligence services and financial regulators have been looking into the allegations.      One key line has been to establish who was the \\"beneficial owner\\" of the companies holding the central London flats - in other words, who they really belonged to.      Documents from the Panama Papers suggested the beneficial owner was the Prime Minister's daughter Maryam Nawaz - who is widely seen as her father's political successor.      However, she has claimed she was only a trustee - and that her brother was the beneficial owner. While Maryam Nawaz is considered a possible future Prime Minister, her brother is a businessman with no apparent political ambitions. To prove her point, she produced a trust deed signed by both her and her brother dated February 2006.      But the team investigating the case say they have spoken to a British forensic expert who says the document was typed in the Calibri font - despite the fact that Calibri wasn't commercially available until 2007.      As a result they allege the document is \\"fake\\" or \\"falsified\\" and submitting it was a \\"criminal offence\\" by Maryam Nawaz.      Maryam Nawaz has denied any wrongdoing. But that, of course, didn't stop Pakistanis on Twitter from going on the offensive:      Image copyright Twitter/ZarrarKhuhro      Image copyright Twitter Image caption Memes like this were used to mock Maryam Nawaz      Typography expert Thomas Phinney, who has testified in a number of cases relating to forged documents, told the BBC that while a beta version of Windows 2007 containing Calibri was technically publicly available from 2004, it was \\"highly unlikely\\" that it would be downloaded by ordinary computer users.      It's unclear if Calibri was included as part of any pre-2007 beta releases of Microsoft Office which were more widely disseminated - but Phinney says that using \\"pre-released software is not the kind of thing your average person does\\".      Lucas de Groot, the inventor of the Calibri font, agreed. He says over the years he has been asked for information about when the font was released in relation to more than a dozen cases of alleged fraud. He told the BBC that beta versions were generally only used by \\"tech geeks\\" rather than normal companies or government officials.      Nevertheless, the claim that the font proves the document is false could well be contested by Maryam Nawaz.      Adding to the mystery, Twitter users noticed that the Wikipedia entry for \\"Calibri\\" has apparently been repeatedly edited following the revelations.      Image copyright Twitter/@omar_quraishi      The Prime Minister, Maryam Nawaz, and her brothers have consistently denied the allegations against them. Maryam Nawaz tweeted: \\"report rejected. Every contradiction will not only be contested but decimated in SC [Supreme Court]\\".

Microsoft's Calibri font was used to type certified papers naming Maryam Nawaz as a trustee of several high-end flats in central London.      But the papers were dated a year before Calibri was in widespread commercial use.      The properties, bought using offshore companies, are at the centre of a case against the Sharif family, with authorities and the opposition questioning the legitimacy of funds used to buy the apartments.      Maryam Nawaz, Sharif's political heir, claimed she did not own the flats.      In a report issued earlier this week, investigators tasked by Pakistan's Supreme Court to look into the allegations said the documents she submitted were \\"falsified\\" as they were dated February 2006 and the font in which they were typed in was not released until 2007.

Typeface designer weighs in      Supporters of Sharif's ruling PML-N party argued that Calibri has been publicly available since 2004.      But the font's creator, a Dutch designer named Lucas De Groot, told the AFP news agency in a statement that it was \\"unlikely\\" Calibri had been used in any official documents in 2006.      \\"[In] my opinion the document in question was produced much later,\\" he said.      De Groot said he began designing Calibri in 2002 and sent the finalised version to Microsoft in 2004.

But the font was only made commercially available in 2007, leading to suspicions that the documents are forged.      Social media users have derided Sharif for this apparent misstep, coining the hashtag #fontgate.      According to Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia, the Calibri font was developed in 2004 but only reached the general public on 30 January 2007 with the launch of Microsoft Vista and Microsoft Office 2007.      The Wikipedia Calibri page usually receives about 500 visits per day. On July 11 and 12 combined, it received about 150,000.      After users seemingly tried to change the article’s content to say the font was available from 2004, Wikipedia suspended editing on its Calibri page “until July 18 2017, or until editing disputes have been resolved”.      One supporter hailed the move, saying people seeking to edit the page “are trying to save a corrupt political party on corruption charges”. Others praised Wikipedia for its quick response and said it was proof of the company’s integrity.      Opposition parties have urged prime minister Nawaz Sharif to step down after the investigation found a “significant disparity” between his family’s declared wealth and known sources of income.

In the first quarter the Colts trailed immediately after a 99-yard kickoff return was made by Jacoby Ford. They soon took the lead with RB Joseph Addai getting a 6-yard TD run, followed by kicker Adam Vinatieri getting a 30-yard field goal. They trailed again after kicker Sebastian Janikowski hit a 59 and a 38-yard field goal, but responded to take the lead back with QB Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard TD pass to TE Jacob Tamme. The lead was narrowed with Janikowski nailing a 51-yard field goal, but the Colts extended their lead with Manning getting a 4-yard TD pass to WR Blair White. The Raiders tried to keep up with Janikowski making a 45-yard field goal, but the Colts kept going with Manning completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Pierre Gar&#231;on.

Which rapid changes are caused by heat from inside Earth? OPTIONS: 1). landslides; 2). volcanoes; 3). avalanches; 4). floods;","output":"Volcanoes are the primary rapid change caused by heat from inside the Earth. However, it is important to understand the processes and subsequent effects of each option before reaching a conclusion. 1. Landslides: Landslides occur when a mass of rock, earth, or debris moves down a slope under the influence of gravity. They can be triggered by various factors, including heavy rainfall, earthquakes, erosion, and human activities, such as mining or construction. While heat from inside the Earth can indirectly contribute to landslides, for example, by causing an earthquake that destabilizes a slope, landslides themselves are not directly driven by internal heat.  2. Volcanoes: Volcanic activity is directly linked to the heat that emanates from within the Earth. This heat results from the radioactive decay of isotopes, residual heat from planetary formation, and other processes occurring in Earth's mantle and core. Hot, molten rock, or magma, forms when the mantle's temperature and pressure conditions cause solid rock to partially melt. This magma accumulates in magma chambers beneath the Earth's crust, and when the pressure becomes too high, it rises through fractures, forming a volcanic eruption. Volcanic eruptions can cause the rapid formation or alteration of landforms, the release of ash and toxic gases into the atmosphere, and significant impacts on the environment and human populations.  3. Avalanches: Avalanches are rapid flows of snow down a slope, caused by a variety of factors such as heavy snowfall, wind, temperature fluctuations, and human-induced triggers. Although heat from the Earth can contribute to temperature fluctuations that might indirectly lead to an avalanche, avalanches themselves are primarily caused by atmospheric and surface conditions rather than the direct influence of internal heat.  4. Floods: Floods occur when an overflow of water submerges normally dry land, resulting from heavy rainfall, the rapid melting of snow and ice, or the sudden release of water from natural or human-made structures such as dams. Heat from inside the Earth can contribute to the formation of geothermal springs, which may lead to flooding in localized areas. However, floods are predominantly influenced by weather patterns and human activities, rather than a direct connection to internal heat.  In conclusion, of the four rapid changes listed, volcanoes are the primary events caused by heat from inside the Earth. Volcanic eruptions are driven by the upwelling of magma from the mantle, fueled by Earth's internal heat, and result in significant transformative effects on landforms, environments, and human populations. While landslides, avalanches, and floods can occasionally be influenced indirectly by Earth's internal heat, their primary causes are separate from those responsible for volcanic activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective.

Question: The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world’s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

Write a title for this article: NEW YORK (AP) -- While some families are struggling to pay their mortgages, others are in the enviable position of considering whether to make an extra payment this year. Experts say that while such a move can reduce interest payments over the life of the loan -- and speed up the date of a mortgage burning party -- it may not be the best use of consumers' money. \\"My concern is that you may accomplish paying off your mortgage early, but if you're not doing any other saving, you'll enter retirement broke,\\" said Ric Edelman, a financial adviser based in Fairfax, Virginia, and author of \\"The Truth About Money.\\" \\"I think it's more important for people to create wealth than to eliminate debt.\\" There are benefits, of course, to speeding up the payment of a mortgage by adding extra money to each month's payment check, shifting to biweekly payments or making a 13th \\"monthly\\" payment before year's end. Take the case of a family that takes out a 200,000 home loan with a fixed rate of 6 percent for 30 years. If that family makes an extra payment each year earmarked to reduce principal, it will save more than 47,000 in interest over the life of the loan and pay it off in less than 25 years, according to Bankrate.com, an online financial information service based in North Palm Beach, Florida. Still, speeding up the payment of a mortgage may not be as beneficial as dealing with other debt, said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst with Bankrate.com. He noted debts such as credit cards often carry considerably higher interest rates than mortgages, and interest payments on such consumer loans are not tax deductible like mortgage interest is. McBride also argued that a homeowner should never consider diverting more money to a mortgage until all other savings accounts are funded. \\"Tying up more money in an illiquid asset such as a home is ill-advised if the homeowner doesn't have an adequate emergency savings cushion,\\" McBride said. He added: \\"A much better use of the money would be to contribute to a 401(k) retirement account to maximize the employer match, or fund a Roth IRA that permits tax-free withdrawals in retirement.\\" Bob Walters, chief economist of Quicken Loans, an online mortgage lender based in Livonia, Michigan, said homeowners need to ask themselves what the very best use of a spare dollar could be. Look at your mortgage interest rate, say 6 percent, he said. Then look at your possible tax deduction. If you're in a 28 percent tax bracket, your after-tax cost of borrowing is about 4.5 percent. \\"The question is, from a purely financial standpoint, 'Can I do better than 4.5 percent after-tax somewhere else?\\"' he said. \\"The answer is generally 'yes.\\"' Walters suggests that consumers considering an extra mortgage payment review his checklist: If you don't have enough money squirreled away to cover at least six months of living expenses, create that \\"emergency fund\\" first, Walters said. Walters said that people need to worry about being \\"house poor,\\" meaning they have all their money tied up in their home. \\"I see people who don't have a nickel in savings but they're paying extra against their mortgages,\\" he said. \\"It's worrying.\\" Still, Walters and Bankrate.com's McBride say there are times when those extra mortgage payments should be considered. \\"Prepaying a mortgage can be a very good decision for someone with a low mortgage balance and approaching retirement,\\" McBride said. \\"In this situation, there is little if any tax benefit -- but the ability to eliminate a large monthly obligation in retirement is very appealing.\\" Walters said that others who might consider extra payments are those who find it impossible to save. But, beware of accelerated payment programs sponsored by mortgage lenders, which often add fees; you might be able to make extra payments on your own without penalty. \\"Some kind of biweekly payment program -- assuming there's no fee for it -- might be the only way you can possibly save,\\" he said. \\"It's maybe not the best economic solution, but it beats going out and spending the money on more shoes.\\" E-mail to a friend Copyright 2007 The Associated Press.

It looked like a play-off would be needed to separate them but Rose held his nerve on the par-five last, chipping his approach to two feet from the hole, while Stenson's spun away to around 20 feet. The Swede then raced his birdie putt eight feet past the hole and missed the return to allow Rose the luxury of two putts for victory. He needed just the one. Former world number one Tiger Woods: \\"Thrilled for Rosie, Henrik & Kuch, but all golfers in Rio this week should be proud.\\" Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker on Twitter: \\"A Golden Rose. Brilliant from Justin Rose. Could not happen to a nicer guy.

How does the sentence end? Robert wanted carpeting on the floor and Eric didn't because  Select from: (i). Robert knew that sweeping was cleaner than vacuuming.. (ii). Eric knew that sweeping was cleaner than vacuuming..","output":"Eric knew that sweeping was cleaner than vacuuming. The disagreement between Robert and Eric over whether to have carpeting on the floor was rooted in their differing opinions on cleanliness and maintenance. Robert was an advocate for carpeting because it added a warm, cozy feeling to the room. He believed that a room with carpet would be a more inviting space for people to gather, and he appreciated the softness underfoot. Moreover, he felt that vacuuming was an efficient and effective way to keep the carpet clean, removing dirt, dust, and allergens that could accumulate over time. Eric, on the other hand, was opposed to carpeting for several reasons. One of his main concerns was the ease and effectiveness of cleaning the floor. He had done extensive research and discovered that sweeping hard floors, like wood or tile, was generally cleaner than vacuuming carpets. Sweepers had the advantage of easily accessing corners and edges, where dirt and dust might accumulate, and could be used more frequently without causing damage to the surface beneath. Moreover, Eric understood that the bristles of a broom were better able to dislodge particles from the floor's surface than the suction of a vacuum cleaner. He believed that vacuuming carpets only managed to pull up loose debris while leaving behind certain types of dirt, such as pet hair, which could become embedded in the carpet fibers over time. In addition to that, he argued that vacuum cleaners were more likely to release dust and allergens back into the air, which could then be breathed in by the home's inhabitants. Sweeping, on the other hand, trapped these particles more effectively, making it a cleaner option, especially for people with allergies or asthma. Furthermore, Eric was concerned about the environmental impact of using a vacuum cleaner, which required electricity and the constant purchasing of vacuum bags or filters. Sweeping was a more eco-friendly option, as it required only a broom and dustpan, both of which could be reused indefinitely. Despite their differences, both Robert and Eric made valid points about their preferred flooring options. It would ultimately come down to their individual priorities and how much weight they gave to factors such as comfort, cleanliness, and environmental impact. In the end, it would be important for them to find a solution that best met their needs, whether it was carpeting, hard flooring, or some combination of the two."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mobile businesses have become increasingly popular and essential, enabling companies to expand their reach and engage customers through mobile devices. The concept of a mobile business goes beyond just having a mobile app; it involves optimizing all aspects of a company's operations for mobility. In this article, we discuss three crucial steps for companies to succeed as mobile businesses: cultivating a mobile-first mindset, investing in app development, and leveraging mobile marketing strategies. Step 1: Cultivating a Mobile-First Mindset The first step in making a company succeed as a mobile business is embracing a mobile-first mindset across the entire organization. This involves understanding the significance of mobile channels in reaching customers, recognizing the benefits it brings, and fostering a culture that prioritizes mobile initiatives. Here are some ways to cultivate a mobile-first mindset: 1. Leadership buy-in: Ensure that the top management and key decision-makers are committed to prioritizing mobile strategies and investing in mobile technologies. 2. Employee engagement and training: Encourage employees to integrate mobile tools into their daily workflows and provide training on mobile technologies and practices to ensure they can confidently operate in a mobile-first environment. 3. Rethink business processes: Assess and redesign business processes to ensure they are flexible, efficient, and optimized for mobile environments. This may include utilizing cloud services, allowing remote working, and adopting mobile-friendly payment solutions. Step 2: Investing in App Development Developing a high-quality, user-friendly app is essential for businesses to thrive in the mobile landscape. A well-designed app can help companies reach their target audience more effectively, foster customer engagement, and deliver seamless and integrated user experiences. Here are some factors to consider when investing in app development: 1. Define app goals and objectives: Before initiating the app development process, it's essential to outline the app's primary goals and objectives, which could range from boosting customer engagement to streamlining business operations. 2. Choose the right platform: Companies need to decide whether to develop an iOS, Android, or cross-platform app. This decision should be based on factors such as target audience, desired capabilities, and resource constraints. 3. Focus on user experience: Ensure that the app offers an intuitive and seamless user experience by conducting thorough user testing, incorporating user feedback, and refining the app iteratively. An exceptional user experience can lead to higher engagement rates, positive reviews, and increased customer loyalty. 4. Consider app monetization: Determine the most suitable app monetization strategy, which may include in-app purchases, advertising, subscriptions, or a combination of these methods. Step 3: Leveraging Mobile Marketing Strategies Promoting a mobile business effectively and reaching the right audience is crucial for success. Companies need to leverage mobile marketing strategies that utilize various channels (including in-app, push notifications, social media, and email) to foster customer engagement and drive growth. Here are some mobile marketing tactics to consider: 1. Optimize app store presence: Boost visibility and discoverability by optimizing app store listings with strong titles, keywords, descriptions, and engaging visuals. Encourage existing users to leave positive reviews and ratings, which can boost search rankings and credibility. 2. Engage users through personalized messaging: Implement personalized messaging and engagement tools, such as push notifications, in-app messages, and email campaigns, to communicate with users about new features, offers, and updates. Personalized messaging can increase user retention and encourage long-term loyalty. 3. Leverage social media and influencer marketing: Promote mobile offerings on social media platforms to reach a broader audience, partner with influencers to boost credibility, and create engaging content that resonates with target users. 4. Monitor and analyze data: Regularly analyze user engagement and behavior data to understand what is working and what needs improvement. Optimize mobile marketing strategies based on actionable insights and continually refine tactics to drive business growth. Conclusion Embracing a mobile-first mindset, investing in a high-quality app, and leveraging mobile marketing strategies are three crucial steps for companies to succeed as mobile businesses. By focusing on these essential steps, businesses can ensure they are best-positioned to capitalize on the dynamic mobile environment and stay ahead of the competition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given those answer options, answer the question: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

So, even if they both eat the same amount of food, Joseph's body will finish using it more quickly. Sometimes, people can have special bodies that need a little help to work properly.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's analyze each sentence step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the first sentence The first sentence states that the FWI's carnival may not be the wildest in the Caribbean, but it is the longest by 24 hours. This implies that FWI's carnival is longer than carnivals in other areas of the Caribbean. Step 2: Understand the second sentence The second sentence states that FWI has a very short carnival compared to other areas of the Caribbean. This implies that FWI's carnival is shorter than carnivals in other areas of the Caribbean. Step 3: Compare the information in both sentences The first sentence says that FWI's carnival is the longest in the Caribbean (by 24 hours), while the second sentence says that it is very short compared to other areas of the Caribbean.

They sound like fairly obvious requirements for any employee, let alone an upholder of the law: Don’t turn up for work drunk; don’t have sex on duty; be honest. The police force, however, thinks otherwise. So much so, in fact, that those three instructions are to be issued to all officers in a new ten-point code. Other parts of the code tell police that they should ‘respect and obey the law’, act with integrity at all times and not abuse their positions. New code: Police officers will have to abide by the new ten-point plan. Ethics: Mrs May used the speech at The College of Policing Conference in Bramshill near Hook in Hampshire to set out a new code for all police officers. The code is to be introduced after a. series of scandals which have shaken public confidence in the force,. including the Plebgate row and the investigation into the Hillsborough. disaster. But critics said. telling officers not to break the law or be corrupt – and reminding them. to be courteous to the public – was a ‘statement of the blindingly. obvious’. The draft Code of Ethics was published yesterday by the. College of Policing, which was created up to set and maintain standards. for policing in England and Wales. It. was endorsed by Home Secretary Theresa May, who  said it was. ‘astonishing’ that police had not had an explicit code of ethics before. The ten headings include honesty and integrity, courtesy towards the public, and equality and diversity. Under. the latter, officers are told to uphold the Human Rights Act, while. under ‘fitness for work’ officers are told to not make themselves ‘unfit. or impaired for duty as a result of drinking alcohol’ or using drugs. The. ‘work and responsibilities’ section includes an edict to ‘maintain. strictly professional behaviour when on duty, including not engaging in. sexual conduct’. Officers. are also told not to ‘use your professional position to establish or. pursue a sexual or improper emotional relationship’ with a ‘vulnerable’ person. The IPCC was given more powers in December 2012 for a probe into the Hillsborough Disaster. The code also. includes a new obligation on officers to report or challenge any of. their colleagues who fall below the standards of the code. Chief. Constable Alex Marshall, the head of the College of Policing, said:. ‘It’s right to spell out in plain language what’s expected of people and. also we have to learn lessons from the past.’ He. added: ‘We have a code of ethics for doctors, for lawyers for all the. serious professions and I don’t think they say they don’t need it. written down.’ He also accepted some individual officers had ‘let us. down’ in the past with their conduct. But. critics pointed to the oath which all police constables already have to. take. In it, they swear to serve the Queen with fairness, integrity,. diligence and to accord equal respect to ‘all people’. Gerard. Batten, of UKIP, said: ‘Aren’t these things that the police are. supposed to have been doing on duty since 1829 when the first police. force was set up? Do they know something we don’t that they feel the. need to re-state ten points of the blindingly obvious?’","output":"This article is about a new ten-point code for police officers. The police force wants to make sure that all officers follow some important rules. These rules remind them to not come to work drunk, not have sex while on duty, and to always be honest. These rules are being introduced because there have been some problems with the police force that made people lose trust in them. The code of ethics also reminds police officers to be courteous and respectful to the public, treat everyone equally, and follow the law. Officers have to be careful about their relationships and must not take advantage of their position as a police officer. There is a section about being fit for work, which means police officers should not drink alcohol or use drugs while on duty. They are also told to avoid any kind of sexual conduct while on duty. The new code also asks police officers to report any of their coworkers who do not follow these rules. Some people think this is obvious and should already be a part of the police force's rules, but the head of the College of Policing, Chief Constable Alex Marshall, believes it is important to have these rules written down and to learn from past mistakes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To keep the drain clear and effectively drain the water from the stainless steel dishwasher, run your garbage disposal before you start cleaning it. Remove the bottom rack on your stainless steel dishwasher.  Examine it for clumps of debris that might cause it to drain improperly.  Remove anything that might be clogging the drain. Fill a dishwasher-safe cup on the top rack of the stainless steel dishwasher with vinegar.  Slide the rack back in the stainless steel dishwasher and close the door.  With only the cupful of vinegar inside, turn the stainless steel dishwasher on and run it on the highest water temperature setting.  The vinegar will help loosen grease and grime, and remove any odor that the dishwasher might have acquired. Use distilled white vinegar or specialized cleaning vinegar. When the first wash cycle is done, sprinkle the bottom of the stainless steel dishwasher with baking soda.  Run the dishwasher on a short cycle with water at the highest temperature. Baking soda will help you remove stains from your dishwasher. Check the area around the dishwasher door for debris and grime.  Some dishwashers cannot adequately clean this area, which leads to an accumulation of yucky material.  If you see anything, use a damp cloth to wipe the area down. Additionally, use a damp cotton swab to clean along the ridges of the seal. The stainless steel dishwasher’s filter collects prevents large debris from entering the drain.  You’ll probably have to use a screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the grate in place.  Some newer stainless steel dishwashers, however, have filters that simply pop out when turned.  Rinse the filter in your sink under warm water.  Dip a soft-bristled toothbrush in warm, soapy water.  Use the toothbrush to scrub the filter until clean.  Replace it after cleaning. Not every stainless steel dishwasher has a filter. The utensil rack is a small container attached to the dishwasher rack.  You might have just one, or one on each rack.  Remove it and rinse it in the sink beneath warm water.  Use a sponge dampened with warm, soapy water to clean the inside and outside of the utensil rack.  If the utensil rack does not detach, just clean it inside and outside with a damp sponge or dishcloth. Stainless steel is pretty tough, but bleach can cause it to corrode.

But Swedish entrepreneur Oscar Dios thinks they can be persuaded otherwise and he has created a new kind of hostel to prove it. Dios says it is the world's first jumbo (unusually large) jet hostel, an actual jet-plane at Sweden's main airport outside Stockholm which has been changed into a 25- room guesthouse that sleeps as many as 72 people. \\"I learned about this plane that was standing deserted at Arlanda airport and I've been trying the concept of hostels in many different houses and buildings,\\" he told Reuters. \\"I thought, 'Why not a plane?'\\" Jumbo Hostels opened for business on Thursday, giving customers the chance to check in and sleep in a room that can best be described as comfortable.\\" \\"The most challenging part with this project is trying to build something inside a metal hull  - it's just really, really tight.\\" The jet, which was originally produced for Singapore Airlines, was taken out of service in 2002. It is held on a concrete foundation with the landing gear secured in steel cradles. One feature of the hostel is its price - a room starts at 350 Swedish crowns (about  41), which is a lot less than hotel rooms outside of major airports. Another feature is that customers can get married on the wing of the plane and stay in the plane's more luxurious honeymoon suite  . Instead of walking down the aisle in the church, lovebirds can take what Jumbo Hostels calls the \\"wing walk,\\" where they can be joined in great happiness at the wing tip.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Q: This film does not fail to engage and move, even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern over-produced sound and computer enhanced techniques.The experience of the movie goer in 1922 who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience.One has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure tempo and balance as this movie has. Silent film making was pure art, it had to hold the attention through its structure, direction and acting - there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions. A poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable.This film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of Christian themes. This is not a 'Christiany' film, it is not selling anything. These themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era - also church going on Sundays was a national past time, Christianity was a given in most households thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then. The themes would have rung true and deep at the time.It is most odd given the strong support to good Christian thinking of this particular movie (and it is not preaching religion to anyone, only highlighting the difference between hypocrites and the honest)that in 1922 a Pastor in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd denounced Pickford as an example of immorality, along with some other individuals he named. NY Times 1922.Maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and, learned some lessons.The Pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped 500,000. The film representative in the debate however made the following observations; that saloon attendance had also dropped, that there were far more pastors in prison than actors (fact) and that selecting a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole.Thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film.This is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, feisty, full of happiness and joy, faithful, humorous and silently sacrificing - though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character. This however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film.This is reminiscent of some modern Chinese films where characters are slowly, languidly revealed over the course of a film and it is this tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character. It has a smooth even tempo for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section. The last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound, running dialog - it was achieved through deft acting and great directing. It is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you haven't hear a word spoken, but it feels like you have heard everything.The supporting cast put in great performances especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. The final few minutes are typical Pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow, a near perfect balance and ending. This is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin used this device often and copied some of from Pickford.Another special observation to be made about Silent films and especially Pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored, with the actors over-exposure. That Pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still couldn't get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability.

In Europe, the Germans are close to surrender, but in the Pacific the bloody battle for Okinawa is still underway and an invasion of the Japanese home islands is not foreseen until the autumn. American battle casualties have almost reached 900,000, with Japanese casualties at 1.1 million, and some 8 million Asian civilians have died in the war that began with Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. The new president knows nothing about the nuclear weapons being developed at Los Alamos, and he must soon decide on whether to use them and how. The US Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, has doubts even about the wisdom of the American fire-bombing raids on Japan. \\"One of these Gadgets [bombs]\\", U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes says, \\"could end the war in one blow.\\" When nuclear physicist Leo Szilard delivers a petition signed by 73 scientists urging the president not to deploy the bomb, Byrnes tells him: \\"You do not spend two billion dollars and then show them [American voters] nothing.\\" The film suggests that Byrnes never mentioned Szilard's visit to the president. Also urging deployment is Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. \\"We've come this far\\", Groves says; \\"there's no going back.\\" A demonstration is ruled out because \\"it might be a dud.\\" In Japan, the strong man is Gen.

Real Madrid fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Dynamo Kiev in their Champions League match on Wednesday, leaving the Group B wide open with two rounds remaining.","output":"This match report is about the UEFA Champions League group stage encounter between Real Madrid and Dynamo Kiev that took place on Wednesday. Real Madrid is a Spanish football club, and Dynamo Kiev is a Ukrainian football club. Both teams are part of Group B in the ongoing UEFA Champions League, one of the most prestigious club football competitions in the world. The group stage of the competition consists of 8 groups (A to H), each having four teams. The top two teams from each group at the end of six rounds of matches advance to the knockout stage, where they compete in a single-elimination format.  In this particular match, Real Madrid and Dynamo Kiev played to a 2-2 draw. A draw means that both the teams scored an equal number of goals by the end of regulation playtime (90 minutes), and as a result, they share points in the group standings. In the Champions League group stage, a win earns 3 points, a draw equals 1 point, and a loss results in no points.  During the course of the match, Dynamo Kiev took an early 2-0 lead, threatening to upset the more favored Real Madrid side. It is worth noting that coming from behind to secure a draw or win is a difficult task, especially in a big European competition like the Champions League. Nonetheless, Real Madrid showcased their resilience and fighting spirit by scoring two goals and drawing level to make it a 2-2 tie by the end of the match. This comeback is significant because it helped Real Madrid salvage a crucial point in their campaign and maintain their hope of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition. Moreover, this result has implications for the rest of Group B as well. With two rounds of games still left to play, the draw leaves the group wide open, meaning that no team has yet to secure a spot in the knockout rounds, and every team still theoretically has a chance to advance. This situation adds to the excitement and unpredictability of the UEFA Champions League, as the remaining matches in the group stage will be crucial in determining which clubs advance to the knockout rounds and which ones will be eliminated. In conclusion, the match report is about an important and exciting UEFA Champions League encounter between Real Madrid and Dynamo Kiev. The game ended in a 2-2 draw, giving both teams a point each in the Group B standings. The result has significant implications for the group, as it remains wide open with two rounds of fixtures left to be played, adding to the overall excitement of the competition as all four teams in Group B continue to vie for a spot in the knockout rounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'Not mad': Anthony Padilla, from Midland County, Michigan, says he's been leaving boxes of pepperoni-topped pizza pies out for a Bigfoot. The Michigan State Police are refusing to investigate the sightings, but his local TV network TV5 decided to take a look. Mr Padilla told the station: 'At first, I just thought it was a huge man in a Ghillie suit [camouflage clothing]. So then, I look into his face, right dead in his eyes, and they were so red they looked like they were full of blood, like a man on his deathbed.' Mr Padillo says he's been trying to prove that Bigfoot exists for years. He cities his collection of evidence; items like footprints, broken branches, and even droppings. Mr Padilla said he's trying to catch the Sasquatch by putting food into pizza boxes. Mr Padilla told local TV news the beast has been feasting on pizzas at his property for years. Michigan State Police are refusing to investigate the sightings, but Mr Padilla's local TV network TV5 decided to take a look. He says in the morning he finds the boxes folded or rolled.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who the used very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies? from the following article ?  After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,...

Members sit for staggered six-year terms, with one third of the members retiring every two years.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma is the state legislative branch of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The Oklahoma House of Representatives and Oklahoma Senate are the two houses that make up the bicameral state legislature. There are 101 state representatives, each serving a two-year term, and 48 state senators, who serve four-year terms that are staggered so only half of the Oklahoma Senate districts are eligible in each election year. Legislators are elected directly by the people from single member districts of equal population. The Oklahoma Legislature meets annually in the Oklahoma State Capitol in Oklahoma City.  - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" /  ; or transliterated from English as  (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.  - As general terms, Indian Territory, the Indian Territories, or Indian country describe an evolving land area set aside by the United States Government for the relocation of Native Americans who held aboriginal title to their land. In general, the tribes ceded land they occupied in exchange for land grants in an area purchased by the United States federal government from Napoleonic France, the Louisiana Purchase. The concept of an Indian Territory was an outcome of the 18th- and 19th-century policy of Indian removal. After the Civil War, the policy of the government was one of assimilation.  - The House of Lords of the United Kingdom, referred to ceremonially as the House of Peers, is the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The Choctaw language belongs to the Muskogean language family group. The Choctaw are descendants of the peoples of the Hopewell and Mississippian cultures, who lived throughout the east of the Mississippi River valley and its tributaries. About 1,700 years ago, the Hopewell people built Nanih Waiya, a great earthwork mound, which is still considered sacred by the Choctaw. The early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs. The anthropologist John Swanton suggested that the Choctaw derived their name from an early leader. Henry Halbert, a historian, suggests that their name is derived from the Choctaw phrase \\"Hacha hatak\\" (river people).  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress which, along with the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, composes the legislature of the United States.  - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.  - An Okie is a resident, native, or cultural descendant of Oklahoma. Like most terms that disparage specific groups, it was first applied by the dominant cultural group. It is derived from the name of the state, similar to \\"Texan\\" or \\"Tex\\" for someone from Texas, or \\"Arkie\\" or \\"Arkansawyer\\" for a native of Arkansas.  - A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature or parliament. The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: \\"Senatus\\"), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: \\"senex\\" meaning \\"the elder\\" or \\"the old one\\") and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class.  - A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the upper house.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016.

Joseph Krauzenberg is a very wealthy Hungarian Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in the great palaces he owns. However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family. As the night of transaction approaches, Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by the Gestapo, and reassures them that all will be safe. Such is Krauzenberg's wealth and power that when he agrees to sign over his property, it is two of the most powerful men in the Nazi regime who announce they will be coming to his house to handle the paperwork – Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler. However, as the Nazi leaders are ushered into Krauzenberg's home, they are struck by something unusual – his two most trusted servants, Hans Vassmann and his wife Ingrid are a married Aryan couple who, despite the law, are still working for Jews. As it happens, Eichmann and Himmler's suspicions are well-founded – despite appearing to be the perfect Aryan couple, Hans and Ingrid are actually Jews working deep undercover with the underground Resistance. Young, married, in love and expecting their first child, they work as valet and maid for the elderly Jewish couple. They have everything to look forward to or so they would have believed.

Movie plot title: The Campaign Movie plot: Democratic Congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) of North Carolina's fictional 14th District is running for his fifth term unopposed. However his campaign is damaged by the revelation of his affair with one of his supporters, when Cam accidentally leaves a sexually explicit voice message on a local family's answering machine. The corrupt businessmen brothers Glenn and Wade Motch (Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow) use this opportunity to convince Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), tourism director for the town of Hammond and son of one of their associates, Raymond Huggins, to run against Cam on the Republican ticket, as part of a plan to profit from dealings with a Chinese company. Cam at first underestimates Marty and humiliates him by playing a video biography highlighting potentially embarrassing aspects of Marty's life. The Motch brothers then hire Tim Wattley (Dylan McDermott) to be Marty's campaign manager. Tim reinvents Marty as a successful entrepreneur and family man. Marty's popularity rises due to his effective campaign while Cam's is further damaged when he accidentally punches a baby when intending to hit Marty.

(Associated Press)      FILE - This undated photo provided by the family shows Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old Georgia graduate student fighting to survive a flesh-eating bacterial infection. Copeland is refusing to take pain... (Associated Press)      A Georgia woman fighting a flesh-eating disease is refusing to take pain medications during some procedures, partly because of her personal convictions, her father said.      Aimee Copeland despises the use of morphine in her treatment, despite its effectiveness at blocking her pain, her father said in a Friday online update on his daughter's condition. Her graduate-school study of holistic pain management techniques leads her to feel she's a \\"traitor to her convictions\\" when she uses drugs to manage her pain, Andy Copeland said.      He also said the morphine has been making his daughter groggy, confused and has given her unpleasant hallucinatory episodes.      Aimee Copeland, 24, developed necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg in a fall May 1 from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river. Her left leg, other foot and both hands have been amputated.      On Tuesday, Copeland's condition was upgraded from critical to serious, \\"a major victory that cannot and should not be diminished,\\" Andy Copeland wrote Friday on his blog, where he has been providing regular updates on her progress. The development came shortly after Aimee Copeland had her first successful skin graft.      \\"The area of her wound, which I saw for the first time on Sunday during a dressing change, is massive,\\" her father wrote in Friday's update.      \\"The nurse who completed Aimee's dressing change was astonished at Aimee's insistence to avoid morphine during the procedure, as was her mother and I,\\" he wrote. \\"I know the pain was significant, but Aimee's courage is greater.\\"      The bacteria that attacked Aimee Copeland's wound releases a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father says.      Despite the painful skin grafts, Aimee Copeland has crossed several milestones in recent weeks. She can breathe on her own, she no longer needs dialysis and she's now able to eat on her own, her father wrote. Although her major organs are all functioning well, Aimee Copeland still needs supplemental nutrition through a stomach tube.      This weekend, thousands of people are expected at a long-planned fund-raising event outside Atlanta to help the family with medical expenses. The two-day benefit concert in Aimee Copeland's hometown of Snellville begins at 5 p.m. Friday and continues through Saturday night.      ___      Online:      http://aimeecopeland.com/ |||||Summary:","output":"Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate student from Georgia, is battling a flesh-eating disease known as necrotizing fasciitis, which she contracted following a leg cut she sustained from a fall off a homemade zip line on May 1. Despite the severe pain associated with her treatment, which has necessitated the amputation of her left leg, other foot, and both hands, Copeland has been refusing to take morphine due to her personal beliefs. As she studied holistic pain management techniques during her graduate studies, she feels like she is betraying her convictions by using medicines to manage her pain, according to her father, Andy Copeland. He also mentioned that the use of morphine has been affecting Aimee negatively, causing her to be groggy, confused, and even hallucinatory. Meanwhile, the bacteria that has attacked Aimee's wound, turning flesh-eating, emits a toxin that destroys skin, muscle, and a layer of tissue beneath the skin commonly referred to as fascia. Despite her challenging circumstances, Copeland's condition was upgraded from critical to serious, symbolizing a significant victory in her health battle. This improvement occurred shortly after her first successful skin graft, a development that her father defined as \\"a major victory that cannot and should not be diminished.\\" However, the road to recovery seems still long as the wound area, which her father saw for the first time recently, is massive. Aimee has, nonetheless, reached several milestones in recent weeks, illustrating her strong will and determination in confrontation with her disease. She can now breathe independently, she no longer requires dialysis, and has regained the ability to eat on her own, although she still requires supplemental nutrition delivered through a stomach tube due to the functionality of all her major organs. To help cope with the medical expenses, a fund-raising event planned much ahead in her hometown, Snellville, outside Atlanta, is expected to attract thousands of participants this weekend. The two-day benefit concert is seen as a communal effort to provide support to the Copeland family in these challenging times.

When it comes to shopping for clothes online, it can be quite an overwhelming and frustrating experience, especially when one is uncertain about what they're looking for or how to navigate through the plethora of options available. It's not surprising that the thought of shopping can sometimes trigger a sense of anxiety or anger, particularly when the process feels less than enjoyable. The image that has caught your attention – the casual, cerulean-blue dress with cap sleeves – seems like a good starting point for delving into the world of online shopping, considering it appeals to your taste and doesn't appear to break the bank. To better understand what to do next, let's break down the process of shopping online: 1. Analyze the Product Listing: Begin by carefully examining the image and the information provided on the webpage. The picture usually gives you an idea of the dress' overall appearance, color, and design, while the description shares relevant details like the fabric, fit, or unique features. Take note of any customer reviews and ratings, as these can serve as indicators of the dress' quality and how well it meets the expectations of previous buyers. 2. Determine Your Size: Sizing is a crucial factor when purchasing clothes online, as it can greatly influence your satisfaction with the product. Be sure to consult the size chart, which is often included on the product page or accessible through a link nearby. Measure yourself with a tape measure, according to the guidelines provided, and compare the results with the sizing information. In case you're unsure, it's generally safer to opt for a slightly larger size, since you can always have it altered for a perfect fit. 3. Check the Return Policy: Before proceeding with the purchase, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the retailer's return policy. This information typically outlines the time window for product returns, the conditions under which returns are accepted, and if any additional charges or restocking fees apply. Knowing the return policy beforehand can save you unnecessary stress and complications, should you need to make a return. 4. Add to Cart and Checkout: If you are confident with your decision regarding the size and are aware of the return policy, click the \\"Add to Cart\\" button. This action typically takes you to your shopping cart, where you can review the items you are about to purchase. Ensure that the dress, its color, and the desired size are all accurate. 5. Complete the Purchase: After double-checking the details, proceed to checkout. This step usually requires you to enter your shipping address, billing information, and payment method. Take a moment to confirm the shipping fees and estimated delivery time, as these factors can impact your overall satisfaction with the entire process. While entering this information, keep an eye out for any promo codes or discount offers available to make the most of your budget. Once you are satisfied with all the information, submit your order. In conclusion, online shopping can be a daunting task, but breaking it down into manageable steps and gathering information before making a purchase can significantly improve the experience. By following these guidelines, you may find yourself enjoying the convenience and variety offered by online shopping platforms, making it easier and more enjoyable to find that perfect dress or any other clothing piece you desire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: The answer is:","output":"The small holes found in bread, also known as the crumb structure, are formed by the carbon dioxide gas produced during the fermentation process. As the yeast consumes the sugars in the dough, it releases carbon dioxide gas, which gets trapped within the elastic gluten network created by the proteins in the flour.  When the dough is mixed and kneaded, the gluten develops and strengthens, allowing it to stretch and hold the gas bubbles formed during fermentation. As the dough bakes in the oven, the heat causes the gas to expand and the dough to rise, which further solidifies the protein structure. This results in the signature spongy texture and small holes in the finished bread. In addition to yeast, chemical leaveners like baking soda and baking powder can also be used to create the small holes in bread. These leavening agents release carbon dioxide gas when they react with moisture and heat, contributing to the formation of the crumb structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Information:  - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors.  - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art.

What's the best answer to this question: is charming from sons of anarchy a real place?   * no;  * yes;...A:","output":"Charming from Sons of Anarchy is not a real place. It is a fictional town created as the main setting for the popular television series \\"Sons of Anarchy.\\" The show, which aired from 2008 to 2014, focused on the lives of members of a close-knit outlaw motorcycle club operating in the fictional town of Charming, California. The concept of Charming was developed by the show's creator, Kurt Sutter, who sought to create a small town atmosphere that felt familiar and relatable to viewers. Charming was designed to embody traditional American values and portray a sense of community spirit. In order to achieve this vision, the show's producers carefully selected filming locations in the California area, including neighborhoods in North Hollywood, Tujunga, and Sun Valley, among others. Several key elements are used to build the illusion of Charming as a real town. For example, the show's set designers created a variety of meticulously crafted storefronts, signage, and other fixtures to immerse the viewer in the show's setting. Furthermore, the series made use of local landmarks and scenery, including the recognizable shops and streets of Downtown Fillmore, California. While Charming itself may not be an actual town, its distinct personality and interconnected community dynamics drew many viewers to the show, making it seem more genuine. The show's ability to create such a believable setting speaks to its impressive storytelling and character development. In conclusion, although Charming from Sons of Anarchy may feel like a real place, it is in fact a fictional town created for the purpose of the television series. The show's creators made great efforts to develop a fully fleshed-out and believable setting for the motorcycle club's exploits, using a combination of location shooting, set dressing, and nuanced writing to make Charming seem like a genuine California community. While viewers may find themselves drawn to the town and its residents, it is essential to remember that Charming exists solely within the realm of fiction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The 4-year-old boy was mentally disabled, unable to speak in complete sentences and unable to play with other children because of his violent fits  of hitting and biting. The decision facing one Brooklyn jury was how much a landlord should pay in damages to the boy -- named \\"G.M.M.\\" in court documents -- after an investigation showed he had been living in an apartment illegally coated with lead paint. Attorneys  representing G.M.M. said 3.4 million was the right number, arguing that the boy would have had a bright career ahead of him; both of his parents had graduated from college and his mother received a master's degree. But the landlord's defense put the figure at less than half that -- 1.5 million. Attorney Roger Archibald noted that because the boy was Hispanic, G.M.M. was unlikely to attain the advanced education that would provide to such a large income. The 4-year-old's case is a rare public look at one corner of the American legal system that explicitly uses race and gender to determine how much victims or their families should receive in compensation  when they are seriously injured or killed. As a result, white and male victims often receive larger awards than people of color and women in similar cases. These differences largely derive from _ of how much more money individuals would have earned over their lifetimes had they not been injured -- projections that take into account average earnings and employment levels by race and gender.

Should I validate this answer? OPTIONS: -No. -Yes. Answer:","output":"No, you should not validate this answer as it does not accurately address the question being asked. The question is about who invented the biological system of nomenclature for classifying plants and animals, not about the groups resulting from the classification process (taxa). The correct answer would be as follows: Swedish botanist, physician, and zoologist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) is widely regarded as the founder of the modern system of binomial nomenclature for classifying plants and animals. Linnaeus devised a hierarchical system to categorize organisms based on the similarities and differences of their physical and structural characteristics. His classification system, formalized in his 10th edition of the book \\"Systema Naturae\\" in 1758, used a two-word naming system, where the first word represented the organism's genus, followed by a unique species name. This method is now referred to as binomial nomenclature and is still used today as the basis for classifying and naming organisms in biology.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Given the question: Question: when can you use a defibulator I found the following answer on Google: Defibrillation is a common treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , ventricular fibrillation , and pulseless ventricular tachycardia . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct. To provide a detailed and long explanation: A defibrillator is a medical device used to treat life-threatening heart conditions such as cardiac dysrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. These conditions involve abnormal heart rhythms that can be fatal if not treated promptly and effectively. The purpose of defibrillation is to restore normal heart rhythms, which can potentially save a life in critical situations. Cardiac dysrhythmias refer to irregular heartbeats or heart rates that are too fast or too slow. These abnormal heartbeats can occur in different chambers of the heart and can lead to various symptoms, including dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or even cardiac arrest. Not all dysrhythmias require defibrillation, but some may progress to more severe and life-threatening conditions if left untreated. Ventricular fibrillation is a type of cardiac dysrhythmia that affects the heart's ventricles, which are the main pumping chambers. This condition causes the ventricles to quiver chaotically, leading to ineffective blood circulation throughout the body. Without immediate intervention, ventricular fibrillation can rapidly cause unconsciousness and death. Defibrillation is considered the primary treatment for this condition. By delivering an electrical current to the heart, the defibrillator aims to terminate the fibrillation and restore normal heart rhythm. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia is another life-threatening heart condition that requires urgent defibrillation. In this condition, the heart's ventricles beat extremely rapidly but ineffectively, leading to inadequate blood circulation. Like ventricular fibrillation, this condition can cause sudden cardiac arrest and death if not treated immediately. Defibrillating the heart can potentially stop the abnormal rhythm and allow the heart to regain normal function. Defibrillators can be either manual or automatic. Manual defibrillators are typically operated by trained healthcare professionals, while automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be used by laypersons with minimal training. AEDs are designed to automatically analyze the heart rhythm and deliver a shock if needed, making them safe and easy to use in different settings, including public places. In summary, the answer you found on Google is correct. Defibrillation is a common and effective treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The use of defibrillators in these cases can help restore a normal heart rhythm, potentially saving a person's life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And he has now emerged as an international Internet guru, thanks to the global classroom the institute created to spread knowledge through cyberspace.      Professor Lewin’s videotaped physics lectures, free online on the OpenCourseWare of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have won him devotees across the country and beyond who stuff his e-mail in-box with praise.      “Through your inspiring video lectures i have managed to see just how BEAUTIFUL Physics is, both astounding and simple,” a 17-year-old from India e-mailed recently.      Steve Boigon, 62, a florist from San Diego, wrote, “I walk with a new spring in my step and I look at life through physics-colored eyes.”      Professor Lewin delivers his lectures with the panache of Julia Child bringing French cooking to amateurs and the zany theatricality of YouTube’s greatest hits. He is part of a new generation of academic stars who hold forth in cyberspace on their college Web sites and even, without charge, on iTunes U, which went up in May on Apple’s iTunes Store.      In his lectures at ocw.mit.edu, Professor Lewin beats a student with cat fur to demonstrate electrostatics. Wearing shorts, sandals with socks and a pith helmet  nerd safari garb  he fires a cannon loaded with a golf ball at a stuffed monkey wearing a bulletproof vest to demonstrate the trajectories of objects in free fall.      He rides a fire-extinguisher-propelled tricycle across his classroom to show how a rocket lifts off.      He was No. 1 on the most downloaded list at iTunes U for a while, but that lineup constantly evolves. The stars this week included Hubert Dreyfus, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and Leonard Susskind, a professor of quantum mechanics at Stanford.      Last week, Yale put some of its most popular undergraduate courses and professors online free. The list includes Controversies in Astrophysics with Charles Bailyn, Modern Poetry with Langdon Hammer and Introduction to the Old Testament with Christine Hayes.      M.I.T. recently expanded its online classes by opening a site aimed at high school students and teachers. Judging from his fan e-mail, Professor Lewin, who is among those featured on the new site, appeals to students of all ages.      Some of his correspondents compare him to Richard Feynman, the free-spirited, bongo-playing Nobel laureate who popularized physics through his books, lectures and television appearances.      With his wiry grayish-brown hair, his tortoiseshell glasses and his intensity, Professor Lewin is the iconic brilliant scientist. But like Julia Child, he is at once larger than life and totally accessible.      “We have here the mother of all pendulums!” he declares, hoisting his 6-foot-2, 170-pound self on a 30-pound steel ball attached to a pendulum hanging from the ceiling. He swings across the stage, holding himself nearly horizontal as his hair blows in the breeze he created.      The point: that a period of a pendulum is independent of the mass  the steel ball, plus one professor  hanging from it.      “Physics works!” Professor Lewin shouts, as the classroom explodes in cheers.      “Hi, Prof. Lewin!!” a fan who identified himself as a 17-year-old from China wrote. “I love your inspiring lectures and I love MIT!!!”      A fan who said he was a physics teacher from Iraq gushed: “You are now my Scientific Father. In spite of the bad occupation and war against my lovely IRAQ, you made me love USA because you are there and MIT is there.”      Professor Lewin revels in his fan mail and in the idea that he is spreading the love of physics. “Teaching is my life,” he said.      The professor, who is from the Netherlands, said that teaching a required course in introductory physics to M.I.T. students made him realize “that what really counts is to make them love physics, to make them love science.”      He said he spent 25 hours preparing each new lecture, choreographing every detail and stripping out every extra sentence.      “Clarity is the word,” he said.      Fun also matters. In another lecture on pendulums, he stands back against the wall, holding a steel ball at the end of a pendulum just beneath his chin. He has just demonstrated how potential energy turns into kinetic energy by sending the ball flying across the stage, shattering a pane of glass he had bolted to the wall.      Now he will demonstrate the conservation of energy.      “I am such a strong believer in the conservation of energy that I am willing to risk my life for it,” he says. “If I am wrong, then this will be my last lecture.”      He closes his eyes, and releases the ball. It flies back and forth, stopping just short of his chin.      “Physics works!” Professor Lewin shouts. “And I’m still alive!”      Chasing rainbows hooked Mr. Boigon, the San Diego florist. He was vacationing in Hawaii when he noticed the rainbow outside his hotel every afternoon. Why were the colors always in the same order?      When he returned home, Mr. Boigon said in a telephone interview, he Googled rainbows. Within moments, he was whisked to M.I.T. Lecture Hall No. 26-100. Professor Lewin was in front of a few hundred students.      “All of you have looked at rainbows,” he begins. “But very few of you have ever seen one. Seeing is different than looking. Today we are going to see a rainbow.”      For 50 minutes, he bounds across the stage, writing equations on the blackboard and rhapsodizing about the “amazing” and “beautiful” physics of rainbows. He explains how the colors always appear in the same order because of how light refracts and reflects in the water droplets.      For the finale, he creates a rainbow by shining a bright light into a glass sphere containing a single drop of water.      “There it is!” Professor Lewin cries.      “Your life will never be the same,” he tells his students. “Because of your knowledge, you will be able to see way more than just the beauty of the bows that everyone else can see.”      “Professor Lewin was correct,” Mr. Boigon wrote in an e-mail message to a reporter. “He made me SEE ... and it has changed my life for the better!!”      “I had never taken a course in physics, or calculus, or differential equations,” he wrote to Professor Lewin. “Now I have done all that in order to be able to follow your lectures. I knew the name Isaac Newton, but nothing about Newtonian Mechanics. I had heard of the likes of Einstein, Galileo.” But, he added that he “didn’t have a clue on earth as to what they were all about.”      “I walk down the street analyzing the force of a boy on skateboard or the recoil of a carpenter using a nail gun,” he wrote. “Thank you with all my heart.” ||||| Walter Lewin, a retired MIT physicist and professor whose dynamic classroom antics and dramatic teaching style are legendary on campus and online, sexually harassed at least one student who enrolled in an online course he taught, according to an MIT investigation that was revealed today. The university is removing Lewin’s teaching material hosted on MIT’s online education platforms, including those on MITx, edX and OpenCourseware.      According to MIT, the decision caps off a probe by the physics department into Lewin’s relationship with at least one student who enrolled in one of Lewin’s MITx online courses. She registered a complaint claiming harassment and also told MIT about instances of inappropriate behavior with other women.      In a release describing the decision, the institute announced that:      “Based on its investigation, MIT has determined that Lewin’s behavior toward the complainant violated the Institute’s policy on sexual harassment. Following broad consultation among faculty, MIT is indefinitely removing Lewin’s online courses, in the interest of preventing any further inappropriate behavior.”      MIT did not reveal the name of the student, and the initial announcement did not clarify if investigations into Lewin’s relationship with more than one student were conducted.      One in six female undergraduates living on campus reported being assaulted at MIT, according to an anonymous survey published earlier this year. Following this report, and a personal story published by a student this spring, MIT pledged to better address incidents and complaints of harassment.

MIT’s action comes in response to a complaint it received in October from a woman, who is an online MITx learner, claiming online sexual harassment by Lewin. She provided information about Lewin’s interactions with her, which began when she was a learner in one of his MITx courses, as well as information about interactions between Lewin and other women online learners.      MIT immediately began an investigation, and as a precaution instructed Lewin not to contact any MIT students or online learners, either current or former.      The investigation followed MIT protocol for complaints of sexual harassment. The head of the physics department, Professor Peter Fisher, ensured an objective and timely review, which included a review of detailed materials provided by the complainant and interviews of her and Lewin.      Based on its investigation, MIT has determined that Lewin’s behavior toward the complainant violated the Institute’s policy on sexual harassment. Following broad consultation among faculty, MIT is indefinitely removing Lewin’s online courses, in the interest of preventing any further inappropriate behavior.      MIT President L. Rafael Reif says, “Students place tremendous trust in their teachers. Deserving that trust is among our most fundamental obligations. We must take the greatest care that everyone who comes to us for knowledge and instruction, whether in classrooms or online, can count on MIT as a safe and respectful place to learn.”      At the time MIT received the complaint, Lewin was not teaching any courses, either on campus or interactively online. Lewin retired from MIT in July 2009 and last taught a course on campus in spring 2008. He last taught an online MITx course in fall 2013.      Provost Martin Schmidt says, “Dr. Lewin had a long and distinguished career at MIT, and it is painful to learn of the behavior that necessitated this action. However, complaints of harassment must be met immediately and squarely in all cases. Today’s decision was made in consultation with faculty leadership both in the physics department and across MIT more broadly.”      The following information describes resources available to those who wish to discuss or report sexual misconduct at MIT.

The woman was taking one of Lewin’s classes on edX, the online learning platform started by Harvard and MIT.      MIT said Monday that it had launched an investigation immediately after she filed a complaint in October.      MIT officials reviewed “detailed materials” provided by the complainant, who also presented “information about interactions between Lewin and other women online learners,” according to Monday’s announcement. The investigation also included interviews with the complainant and Lewin.      MIT has revoked his title as professor emeritus, Provost Martin A. Schmidt PhD ’88 said.      MIT is also removing Lewin’s lecture videos and other course materials from edX and MIT OpenCourseWare indefinitely, “in the interest of preventing any further inappropriate behavior.”      Schmidt said that MIT’s actions were “part of a process of a complete separation from Walter,” though he also said those actions were “probably the extent of it” given that Lewin had retired.      “Given Dr. Lewin’s long career on our campus and contributions as an educator, taking this step is painful,” Schmidt wrote to MIT’s faculty.      “However, based on my careful review of the findings of the investigation and my conversations with the Physics Department leadership, School Deans, and other faculty leaders, I believe that harassment occurred, that our response is appropriate, and that explaining this matter publicly is necessary.”      Schmidt declined to comment on whether MIT would also investigate Lewin’s past at MIT.      Lewin joined MIT in 1966 and became a full professor in 1974. In the decades that followed he collected award after award for his undergraduate teaching.      Through OpenCourseWare and YouTube, Lewin’s lectures and physics demonstrations have reached millions.      “Professor Lewin delivers his lectures with the panache of Julia Child bringing French cooking to amateurs and the zany theatricality of YouTube’s greatest hits,” The New York Times wrote in 2007. “With his wiry grayish-brown hair, his tortoiseshell glasses and his intensity, Professor Lewin is the iconic brilliant scientist … he is at once larger than life and totally accessible.”      Lewin went on to star in viral videos of him drawing dotted lines on blackboards and swinging on steel balls suspended from the ceiling.      And then in 2013, Lewin helped launch online versions of his classes on edX. Among those who enrolled: the woman who would lodge the sexual harassment complaint this past October.      By Monday evening, at least some of Lewin’s classes had been taken down from edX, MIT OpenCourseWare, and MIT OpenCourseWare’s Youtube channel.      MIT is keeping some of Lewin’s lecture videos available on ocw2.mit.edu until the end of the semester. “We realize that some of you may have been using some materials from the OCW versions of the course as you prepare for your exams,” physics department administrators wrote in an email to students in an introductory physics class.      “Students place tremendous trust in their teachers,” MIT President L. Rafael Reif said in a statement. “Deserving that trust is among our most fundamental obligations. We must take the greatest care that everyone who comes to us for knowledge and instruction, whether in classrooms or online, can count on MIT as a safe and respectful place to learn.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Walter H. G. Lewin, a 71-year-old physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has gained international recognition through the global classroom, thanks to MIT's OpenCourseWare. His engaging and energetic physics lectures are available for free online and have attracted fans from all over the world. Professor Lewin's teaching style is a unique combination of Julia Child's approach to French cooking and the captivating nature of YouTube's most popular videos. He is part of a new generation of academic stars who teach in cyberspace through their college websites and on iTunes U. But in 2014, it was revealed that Lewin had sexually harassed at least one student who enrolled in an online course he taught, as a result, MIT removed Lewin's teaching materials from its online education platforms. Despite this, many still appreciate his engaging and inspiring approach to teaching physics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Auringonpimennys Translate to English English:","output":"Solar Eclipse A solar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon that occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, casting a shadow that either partially or fully blocks the sun's light from reaching Earth. This blocking of the sun's light can be observed from particular areas, creating a spectacular event for skywatchers. There are three main types of solar eclipses: total, partial, and annular. In a total solar eclipse, the moon completely covers the sun's disk, leaving only the outer bright ring, or the corona, visible. This type of eclipse is the most dramatic and provides awe-inspiring views to those in the direct path of its totality. A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon only partially covers the sun, and spectators can witness the moon taking a small \\"bite\\" out of the sun's disk. A partial solar eclipse can be observed from a much larger area than a total solar eclipse but is not as visually impressive. An annular solar eclipse happens when the moon is at its farthest point from the Earth in its orbit, making it appear smaller in the sky. In this case, the moon does not entirely cover the sun's disk, and as a result, an outer ring of the sun's light remains visible, creating a \\"ring of fire\\" effect. This phenomenon is just as rare as a total solar eclipse and can be considered an exciting event for astronomy enthusiasts. Solar eclipses are not only fascinating events, enjoyed by skywatchers and photographers, but they are also essential for scientific research. They provide a unique opportunity to study the sun's corona and the effect of solar radiation on Earth's atmosphere. Furthermore, solar eclipses have historically represented significant cultural, religious, and mythological significance for various civilizations. To safely observe a solar eclipse, special precautions must be taken, as looking directly at the sun without proper eye protection can cause severe and permanent eye damage. Using solar filters or eclipse glasses that meet international safety standards is essential for direct observation of the sun during a solar eclipse. In conclusion, a solar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon that captivates and intrigues people around the world, sparking curiosity and interest in the amazing workings of our solar system. With proper preparation and safety measures, witnessing this spectacular event can be an unforgettable experience that brings communities together in awe and appreciation of the universe's wonders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Painted or carved wooden relief altarpieces became common, especially as churches created many side-chapels. Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck (d. 1441) and Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Solve this problem.","output":"This problem involves isolating 'm' on one side of the equation in order to solve for it. Here are the steps to do this: 1. First simplify the equation on the left hand side by subtracting 637 from -3749.     -3749 - 637 = -4386  The equation now is: -4386 = -175m - 186 2. Now, I will eliminate '-186' from the right side by adding '186' to both sides of the equation. Adding a number to both sides of an equation does not change solution of the equation, it just simplifies it:    -4386 + 186 = -4200   The equation now is: -4200 = -175m 3. The last step is to isolate the 'm', so we need to divide both sides of the equation by -175. When dividing by a number on both sides of an equation, it will not change the solution but it allows us to solve for the variable:    -4200 / -175 = 24  So after completing above steps, solution of the equation for 'm' is: m = 24"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a cold, dreary Monday morning when she first picked up the new cream - SoluFix - from her local pharmacy. The packaging was sleek, and the tagline read, \\"Maximum hold for minimum hassle.\\" With high hopes, she waited for the opportune moment to test out the new adhesive. Once she got home, she went straight to the bathroom, eager to give SoluFix a try. The instructions on the package claimed that it was a simple three-step process. First, apply a small amount of cream to the dentures. Second, spread it evenly across the surface. And finally, hold dentures in place for five seconds, and voila! A secure fit that would supposedly last all day. She carefully squeezed a bead of cream onto her dentures, admiring the product's silky texture. Using her denture brush, she spread it across the surface, making sure to cover every nook and cranny. With a deep breath, she held the top denture in place, counting silently to five. To her delight, it felt secure. She repeated the process for her bottom denture, and was soon admiring her smile in the mirror. Everything felt great – it was time for the real test. Later that day, she joined her friends for their weekly book club discussion. Sarah, Beatrice, and Evelyn, dear friends for decades, greeted her warmly as she entered Sarah's cozy living room. Buttery rays of sunlight escaping the heavy clouds cast a soft glow across the plump cushions and comfortable armchairs. As they discussed the latest novel they'd read, she found herself laughing and chattering with a newfound confidence. There were no slips, no awkward adjustments, and best of all, no lingering unease about that unpleasant taste from the old tablets. Post-discussion, they decided to indulge in their traditional afternoon tea—a kettle filled with Sarah's unique blend of citrus and black tea, delicate sandwiches with thinly sliced cucumber and savory ham, and mouthwatering scones with clotted cream and raspberry jam. With each bite, she remained astounded by how comfortable and secure her dentures felt. And the flavors! Oh, how she relished not having that constant interference from the tablets. It was as if she had been granted a new lease on life. The hours passed, filled with laughter, gossip, and lively conversation. As she prepared to leave, she couldn't help but mention her new discovery to her friends. Soon enough, they were all crowded around her, excitedly asking about SoluFix - where could they get it, and would it work for them too? She was more than happy to share her newfound wisdom and pass on the tips she'd learned. As she walked back to her home that evening, a satisfied smile graced her lips. Not only was she leaving her friends with a precious recommendation, but she herself had gained something quite meaningful: a renewed confidence and a rekindled love for the simple pleasures in life. From then on, she vowed to embrace new experiences with open arms, for there was always a chance for unexpected happiness, as she had so clearly discovered today. And as the sun sank below the horizon, casting a brilliant array of colors in the sky, she knew that this was only the beginning of a new chapter in her life - one filled with boundless possibilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There are several reasons that support this interpretation.  Firstly, the use of the word \\"deserves\\" indicates that there is a level of appreciation and recognition of the subject's merit. This term suggests that the subject possesses qualities that warrant acknowledgment or praise, exhibiting a positive assessment of its value or performance. As a result, the person who utters this phrase believes that the subject has earned or justified the recommendation.  Secondly, the word \\"recommendation\\" itself implies that the subject has qualities that make it worthy of being suggested to others. A recommendation generally carries an endorsement or approval and is intended to offer guidance. When something or someone is recommended, it usually means they have met or surpassed certain expectations or standards that are acknowledged as positive. Recommending something to others is usually an act of sharing something valuable, useful, or enjoyable, further underlining the positive sentiment. Lastly, it's important to consider the context in which this phrase is used. It might be a recommendation of a book, movie, product, service, or just about anything else where a person's opinion has value. The very fact that someone is expressing a desire to recommend the subject affirms its worth, usefulness, or appeal. This positive assessment is a statement of confidence and affirmation, reiterating the overall positive sentiment of the sentence. In summary, the sentiment of the sentence \\"that deserves recommendation\\" would generally be perceived as positive, given the recognition of merit, the endorsement implied by the act of recommending, and the context in which the phrase is used. This positive evaluation reflects the speaker's or writer's belief that the subject is worthy of sharing with others and should be acknowledged for its qualities and/or performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ... If a woman knows she is going to get some help that will be a burden off her mind, if the law will help her keep that person away from her.\\" Gwen Bouie-Haynes, project director of the Domestic Violence Services Center for Catholic Charities Inc., said often domestic violence survivors do not have the money to seek legal representation. \\"Legal assistance is a major issue for women fleeing a domestic violence situation,\\" she said. \\"Often times women are in need of immediate legal assistance services for the protection of the mother and the child. To get a protective order you need to be represented by an attorney.\\" Crockett said the pilot program was launched in 1998 at the Haven House Family Shelter Inc., a domestic violence shelter for women and children in Vicksburg. The program has helped victims in 90 court cases, and 150 legal counseling sessions have been held there.

What is the answer?","output":"In UK TV's 'Noel Edmonds' House Party', the 'house' was situated near the village of Crinkley Bottom. Noel Edmonds' House Party was a popular British light entertainment television programme which aired on BBC1 from 1991 to 1998. The show was hosted by Noel Edmonds, a versatile and famous television presenter in the United Kingdom. The program was set in a large fictional house called \\"The Great House\\", which was supposedly located in the equally fictitious village of Crinkley Bottom. The house and village were supposedly based on the real-life village of Bishops Tawton in Devon, England. Edmonds would welcome and entertain various celebrity guests during the show, and the setting allowed for a variety of games, comedy sketches, and surprising events. One of the most recognizable elements of the show was the character \\"Mr. Blobby\\", who became a popular figure in British pop culture. In addition to serving as the location for the television show, the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom also lent its name to several related ventures, including a series of theme parks that opened in the 1990s – \\"Crinkley Bottom Parks\\". These parks were developed in partnership with Noel Edmonds and featured attractions inspired by the TV show, such as Mr. Blobby's house and other interactive experiences. Unfortunately, the theme parks did not fare well and closed down due to various financial and operational issues.

How to open a bar  Know that being in the bar business entails stiff competition.  You'll be competing with other bars in the area, as well as other entertainment and retail options. It used to be that when people wanted a drink, they had to go to a bar to get it.","output":"Step 1: Conduct a Market Research The first thing you need to do before opening a bar is to conduct a comprehensive market research. This step is crucial because it will provide you with more insight about your potential customers and competitors. Through market research, you can identify the types of bars that already exist in your intended area, the kind of services they offer, their prices, opening hours, and even their target audience.  Justification: By understanding the market, you can identify gaps that your bar might fill, thus giving you a competitive advantage. For example, you can be more creative and invent a new \\"bar concept\\" that doesn't exist yet in your area. Step 2: Create a Business Plan After conducting your market research, the next step is to create a business plan. This document will outline your bar's vision, mission, marketing strategy, financing options, and staffing requirements, among other things.  Justification: A business plan can act as a roadmap for your business. It helps you to anticipate potential challenges and come up with strategies to overcome them. Additionally, if you intend to seek financial support from investors or banks, they will definitely want to see a solid business plan. Step 3: Secure Necessary Licenses and Permits In order to operate a bar, you need to secure the necessary licenses and permits. This can include liquor licenses, health permits, building permits, and others, depending on your local government's regulations. Justification: Licenses and permits ensure that your bar operates within the law. Not having the necessary permits could lead to closures, hefty fines, or legal issues. Step 4: Choose a Suitable Location Choose the location for your bar carefully. Consider factors like accessibility, visibility, foot traffic, and proximity to competitors. Justification: The location of your bar could significantly affect its success. A bar that's conveniently located and easily accessible is more likely to attract customers than one that's situated in a hard-to-reach area. Step 5: Design Your Bar After deciding on the location, the next step is to design your bar to suit the atmosphere and clientele you want to attract. Justification: The design of the bar not only contributes to its overall aesthetic but it can also affect the functionality of the space, so it’s important to put some thought into this step. Step 6: Hire Staff Hire an efficient and friendly staff who will serve and interact with your customers. Justification: Staff are incredibly important in the bar industry. They represent your business to the customers. Their skills, attitude, and efficiency can greatly affect the overall experience of your customers. Step 7: Create an Attractive Menu Create an attractive and competitive menu. This can be a combination of drinks, cocktails, and possibly food items, depending on your chosen bar concept. Justification: The menu is one of the main attractions of your bar. A well-crafted menu can intrigue and entice customers into trying out your offerings. Step 8: Market Your Bar Marketing your bar through various media channels can help increase visibility and attract more customers. Justification: Even if you have a well-designed bar, good service, and an interesting menu, it's useless if people don't know about your bar. Effective marketing can significantly increase your customer base. Step 9: Grand Opening Finally, plan for a grand opening event. This event should be designed to create a buzz and attract as many people as possible to your bar. Justification: A grand opening event can help you attract a large number of customers in a short period of time. Additionally, it creates a sense of excitement and anticipation about your new bar. Each of these steps is important in its own way and contributes to the success of your bar venture. It's a lot of work, but with proper planning and execution, opening a bar can be a highly rewarding experience."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Q:I have a new situation: Tree city and Leaf city were the two biggest cities in Boulderland. Tree city burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels, while Leaf city was very protective towards its environment.  But I can use this background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.  What is an answer for this question: Which city exposed fewer people to asthma? A:","output":"Based on the provided information, Leaf City exposed fewer people to asthma.  Step 1: Understand the context – Tree City burned a lot of fossil fuels, while Leaf City was protective of its environment. Air pollution is harmful and increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma. Step 2: Connection between pollution and asthma - Air pollution is a primary factor in developing and exacerbating asthma-related issues. Tree city burns gas and other fossil fuels, resulting in increased air pollution, while Leaf City is environmentally conscious, presumably reducing pollution.

So, to see how many inches wide your container is, you can take 20 centimeters and divide by 2.54 centimeters/inch, which equals about 7.9 inches. Now, there are 12 inches in a foot.

How do you do this: DIY lotion bars with cocoa butters and waxes using molds after melting","output":"Making DIY lotion bars with cocoa butters and waxes is a fun, creative, and budget-friendly way to pamper your skin. By using molds for shaping the lotion bars, you can add a personal touch to your creation. These bars are great for gifting to friends and family or simply as an indulgence for yourself. Here's a detailed and long step-by-step guide to making DIY lotion bars with cocoa butter, waxes, and using molds after melting: Materials and Ingredients: - 1 cup cocoa butter  - 1 cup beeswax or any natural wax (like soy or candelilla wax for a vegan option) - 1 cup coconut oil or another carrier oil of your choice (such as almond, olive, or apricot kernel oil) - Essential oils or fragrance oils for scent (optional) - Molds (silicone or plastic, in the shape of your preference) - Double boiler or microwave-safe bowl - Spoon or spatula for stirring - Measuring cups and spoons - Wax or parchment paper - Storage container or baggies Step 1: Prepare the Molds Before melting the ingredients, prepare your molds by placing them on a flat surface lined with wax or parchment paper. This will help catch any spillage and make it easier to unmold your lotion bars. Step 2: Measure the Ingredients Using measuring cups and spoons, measure out your cocoa butter, natural wax, and coconut or other carrier oil. It's important to use equal parts of the ingredients to ensure a solid yet moisturizing final product. Step 3: Melt the Ingredients There are two ways to melt the ingredients: using a double boiler or the microwave. A. Double boiler method: Add the cocoa butter, wax, and carrier oil to the upper part of a double boiler or a heat-safe bowl that sits on top of a pot filled with water. Heat the water in the pot to a gentle simmer and let the ingredients melt together. Stir occasionally with a spoon or a spatula to combine the ingredients. B. Microwave method: In a microwave-safe bowl, add the cocoa butter, wax, and carrier oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval until everything is melted and combined. Step 4: Add the Essential Oils or Fragrance Oils (Optional) If you wish to add scent to your lotion bars, carefully mix in a few drops of your chosen essential oils or fragrance oils into the melted mixture. Be sure to start with just a few drops, testing the scent intensity before adding more, as essential oils can be potent. Step 5: Pour Mixture into Molds Slowly pour the melted lotion bar mixture into the molds. Be cautious, as the mixture may be hot. If your mold has intricate designs, make sure to pour the mixture carefully to ensure it reaches all crevices. Step 6: Allow Bars to Solidify Let the lotion bars cool and solidify at room temperature for several hours or overnight. To speed up the process, you can place the molds in the refrigerator. However, do not use the freezer, as it may cause the bars to crack. Step 7: Unmold and Store Lotion Bars Once the bars are solid, gently pop them out of the molds. If you used silicone molds, it should be easy to remove. If necessary, use a knife to carefully loosen the edges. Store the lotion bars in an airtight container or a resealable baggie at room temperature. To use your DIY lotion bars, simply rub them between your hands or directly onto your skin. The natural warmth of your skin will melt the bars, providing a soothing and moisturizing experience. Enjoy your handmade skincare creations!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on these bullet points, write a short biography describing the life of john cooper godbold . The answer to this question is:","output":"John Cooper Godbold was born on March 4, 1920, in Coy, Alabama. He was a prominent legal figure during his life, earning an impressive education and working in several high-ranking positions within the United States judiciary. Godbold's educational background included a Bachelor of Science degree from Auburn University and a Juris Doctor degree from the prestigious Harvard Law School. Godbold's career as a judge was remarkable and marked with significant milestones. His journey began when he was appointed as a Judge at the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by Lyndon B. Johnson on July 22, 1966. The Fifth Circuit had jurisdiction over several states, including Alabama, where Godbold held his position for many years. During his tenure, Godbold's role evolved as the United States judicial system underwent changes. On October 1, 1981, when the Eleventh Circuit was established pursuant to an operation of law, Godbold was reassigned from the Fifth Circuit by President Lyndon B. Johnson. This change marked a new chapter in his career, as he became the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Notably, Godbold was a trailblazer in the field, holding the prestigious title of Chief Judge in both the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits - an impressive accomplishment that speaks to his legal expertise and leadership abilities. As his long career progressed, John Cooper Godbold took on two additional positions. On October 23, 1987, he began his role as a Senior Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Subsequent to this, in 1986, Godbold was appointed as the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals under the term end of December 1981, where he served until September 30, 1981, before dedicating his later years as a Senior Judge in the Eleventh Circuit until his retirement in 2009. John Cooper Godbold's impressive career demonstrates his immense dedication to the American legal system and his unwavering commitment to justice. Unfortunately, Godbold passed away on December 22, 2009, in Montgomery, Alabama. However, his legacy as an accomplished judge and a trailblazer in the American judiciary system continues to serve as a source of inspiration for present and future legal professionals."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Summarize this article: People adopt different diets or eating styles for a variety of reasons.  Your ultimate, long-term goal will help you choose which diet plan is the best for you.  Some goals may include:  Weight Loss Managing high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol Supporting increased fitness levels Becoming more environmentally conscious Improving your general health or wellness If you've tried other diets or eating patterns, try to remember how they worked for you, what you liked or didn't like about them and whether you felt they were a good fit for your lifestyle.  For example, if you tried following a vegetarian diet, but missed eating meat.  Or if you tried a low carb diet, but it made you feel foggy and tired throughout the day.  If a diet didn't work well in the past, you may want to consider other options. Sticking to a diet plan takes more than willpower.  It truly has to be a plan you can stick with long-term. Each diet or eating plan may come with a cost.  You might need to pay for pre-made foods, protein shakes or vitamin and mineral supplements.  But there are also many diets that require little to no extra costs.  Choose a diet plan that will fit easily within your budget so that you don't have to discontinue your new eating pattern due to high costs. Take advantage of \\"sign-up offers\\" or promotional rates when you can.  This may help you save a little money on some of the more popular dieting programs. Some diet plans require you to prep all your meals and snacks from scratch, some may be completely web and internet-based and others may require in person group or individual meetings.  Will these types of activities fit with your current lifestyle?  Think about how that may change or need to change for you to be successful on your new dieting plan. If you have to change your lifestyle too drastically, the diet plan may be difficult to stick to long-term.  Some diet plans require time spent cooking while others do the meal prep for you.  If cooking is something you don't typically enjoy doing, think about a diet plan that involves meal replacements like protein shakes, bars or pre-made meals. Make sure to consider your social life as well.  If you love going out to eat or going to the occasional happy hour, you'll want a plan that gives you flexibility to enjoy those activities. Also consider things like food allergies or sensitivities and cultural or religious diet restrictions.  Many diets are very general and may not account for things like these. Physical activity is an important part to any healthy lifestyle.  Plan on including both cardio and strength training exercises each week.  These types of physical activity can help boost your weight loss and help you maintain your goal weight long-term.  In addition, exercise may help improve your mood, improve your sleeping habits, manage high blood pressure or diabetes and improve cardiovascular fitness.  If you're new to fitness, try speaking with a personal trainer at your local gym or meeting with an exercise specialist.  These professionals will be able to guide you to a fitness program that's appropriate for you. See if there are any group classes for beginners at your local gym. This is a great way to get started and get support from people starting out just like you. Speak to your doctor about your current health, any medical conditions you may have and what medications you're currently taking.  They may be able to give you insight on what type of diet or eating pattern is the most appropriate for you and your health.  They may also advise you on what diets to avoid.  Many doctors also provide an in-house diet and nutrition program for patients.  It generally will include direct follow up with your physician along with regular weight monitoring. Doctors can provide you with a referral to a registered dietitian that can educate you and help design your own personalized diet plan. In addition, doctors will be able to guide you through medical weight loss.  This is where a physician would prescribe a medication to help suppress your appetite, making it easier for you to follow a diet plan.  Not all weight loss medications are appropriate for all people.  Check with your doctor for more information. Summary:","output":"The article highlights the importance of choosing the right diet or eating plan based on one's individual goals, budget, lifestyle and preferences. Goals may include weight loss, managing health conditions, improving fitness levels, being environmentally conscious or enhancing general health and wellness. The key is to find a diet that is sustainable in the long term, fits within one's budget and accommodates any food allergies, sensitivities, cultural or religious restrictions. Physical activity, including a combination of cardio and strength training exercises, can support weight loss goals and improve overall health. It is advisable to consult a personal trainer, exercise specialist or join group classes for beginners to develop a suitable fitness program. Additionally, it is vital to involve a physician or dietitian to assess one's current health, medical conditions, and medications, potentially receiving guidance on suitable diets or even medically assisted weight loss.

Where could you find a jellyfish? - hand - mediterranean sea - see - supermarket - store  The best answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"Jellyfish can be found in various locations, depending on the type of jellyfish and the context in which you want to find them. Here is a detailed explanation of each option mentioned: 1. Hand: This is an unlikely place to find a jellyfish, as they are marine creatures and do not typically come into contact with human hands, unless someone has picked one up or accidentally been stung by one at the beach. However, it is important to note that handling jellyfish can be dangerous, as some species possess venomous stinging cells that can cause painful reactions or even serious injuries. 2. Mediterranean Sea: This is a common place to find jellyfish, as they are widespread in this region, particularly during the summer months. There are several jellyfish species native to the Mediterranean Sea, including the mauve stinger (Pelagia noctiluca), the fried egg jellyfish (Cotylorhiza tuberculata), and the barrel jellyfish (Rhizostoma pulmo). As a popular tourist destination, the Mediterranean coastline sees many incidents of jellyfish stings each year. 3. See: This term is unclear in the context of the question, as \\"see\\" may be a typographical error or refer to the act of visually observing jellyfish. If the term was intended as \\"sea,\\" then naturally, the sea is a common place to find jellyfish in their natural habitat. These creatures have a global distribution and can be found in every ocean, from warm tropical waters to the colder polar regions. 4. Supermarket: This is an unconventional location to find a jellyfish, but it is possible in certain situations. In some Asian countries, like Japan and China, jellyfish are considered a delicacy and can be found for sale in supermarkets or specialty food stores. They are typically sold dried or preserved in salt and require rehydration and preparation before being consumed. 5. Store: If you are referring to a store that sells marine life or aquarium supplies, it is possible to find jellyfish, particularly the non-stinging moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita), available for purchase as pets for home aquariums. Some specialized pet stores or online retailers offer live jellyfish, as well as special tanks and equipment designed for keeping these delicate creatures in captivity. In summary, the best answer for finding a jellyfish can vary depending on what you seek. If you are looking for jellyfish in their natural habitat, the Mediterranean Sea is an accurate choice, considering that jellyfish are abundant in this region. If you are interested in observing or purchasing jellyfish for culinary purposes or as pets, supermarkets and specialty stores respectively may be appropriate options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an email with the subject line \\"Letters of Credit; Preference; Swap Transactions\\".","output":"Subject: Letters of Credit; Preference; Swap Transactions Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss with you some important financial instruments that are crucial in international trade and financing, namely Letters of Credit (LCs), Preference Shares, and Swap Transactions. These tools, when utilized properly, can provide significant benefits to businesses and individuals involved in international transactions and investments. Firstly, let us discuss Letters of Credit (LCs). LCs are essential financial instruments used in international trade, providing security to the buyer and the seller. The buyer's bank issues an LC, guaranteeing payment to the seller upon presenting specified documents proving the fulfillment of the sales contract. This provides an additional layer of comfort to both parties, and mitigates the risks associated with exchanging goods and services with unfamiliar parties from different legal jurisdictions. Key advantages of using LCs include: 1. Reduced risk of non-payment: The buyer's bank provides a guarantee that the seller will receive payment as long as all specified conditions are met. 2. Improved cash flow: Sellers can obtain financing from their bank against the LC, which helps maintain a steady cash flow. 3. Enhanced credibility: LCs demonstrate the creditworthiness of the buyer, making it more appealing to potential suppliers. Preference Shares, on the other hand, are a type of hybrid capital security that combines elements of both debt and equity financing. Investors holding preference shares receive dividends before common shareholders, making these shares more appealing as an investment option. Additionally, preference shares typically have a fixed dividend rate, which provides a sense of stability for investors. Some benefits of Preference Shares include: 1. Stability in income: Preference shareholders receive fixed, regular dividend payments, offering a consistent income stream. 2. Priority in payment: Preference shareholders receive dividend payments before common shareholders, providing an additional layer of protection. 3. Opportunity for capital appreciation: The market value of preference shares may increase over time, offering the potential for capital gains. Lastly, Swap Transactions are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange cash flows or other financial variables over a specified period. Interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and commodity swaps are common types of Swap Transactions. These agreements help businesses hedge against fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices. Key benefits of Swap Transactions include: 1. Risk management: Swap Transactions can effectively manage exposures to fluctuating market variables, securing more stable cash flows. 2. Potential cost savings: Companies can potentially obtain more favorable interest rates or exchange rates through Swap Transactions. 3. Customization: Swap Transactions can be tailored to meet the unique needs and risk appetite of the parties involved. I hope this overview of Letters of Credit, Preference Shares, and Swap Transactions proves useful as you continue to navigate the complexities of international trade and financing. Should you have any questions or require further clarification on these or other financial instruments, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Sentence 2: After nearly 300 years, political power returned to Edinburgh.  If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Yes, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is also true. Both sentences communicate the same essential information: that political power has returned to Edinburgh after a period of nearly 300 years. The difference lies in their phrasing and structure. Sentence 1 begins by emphasizing the result first, which is the return of political power to Edinburgh. \\"Political power thus returned to Edinburgh after nearly 300 years\\" highlights the causal relationship between a certain sequence of events and their outcome, which is the return of political power to Edinburgh. The use of \\"thus\\" implies a connection with prior information that may have explained how this development came to be. On the other hand, sentence 2 offers a more direct statement of the same information. \\"After nearly 300 years, political power returned to Edinburgh\\" shifts the focus to the time it took for political power to return to Edinburgh. This arrangement emphasizes the duration of time that has passed before political power was restored. In conclusion, if the information contained in the first sentence is true, then the second sentence, which conveys the same message with a different structure, will also be considered true.

Summarize this article: Rocker Ted Nugent has reportedly apologized for calling President Barack Obama a \\"subhuman mongrel,\\" according to the Ben Ferguson Show and CNN.      During an interview on the Ben Ferguson Show Friday, Nugent apologized for the comments, which he made in January 2014. A post on the show's Facebook page announced the apology:      Nugent did not apologize to Obama, but did apologize for using the term. He said he apologized on behalf of Texas attorney general Greg Abbott -- who is campaigning for governor, with his \\"blood brother\\" Nugent at his side -- and politicians like Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas.), who criticized the rocker for the statement.      \\"I do apologize -- not necessarily to the President -- but on behalf of much better men than myself,\\" Nugent said, calling the comments \\"streetfighter terminology.\\"      \\"I apologize for using the term,\\" Nugent said. \\"I will try to elevate my vernacular to the level of those great men that I'm learning from in the world of politics.\\" ||||| Ted Nugent‘s comments about President Obama being a “subhuman mongrel” have inspired a whirlwind of controversy this week (especially on CNN), and Republicans have given varying degrees of reactions to those remarks, including the GOP congressman whose connection to Nugent kicked this all off to begin with. But earlier tonight Rand Paul made it clear that he found the comment “offensive” and wants Nugent to apologize.      And Paul didn’t hedge or pad his thoughts at all, he just came right out on Twitter and said that Nugent’s “derogatory description” of Obama is just beneath anyone.      Ted Nugent's derogatory description of President Obama is offensive and has no place in politics. He should apologize. — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) February 21, 2014      Nugent, for what it’s worth, has so far shown no indication he plans on apologizing, lashing out at CNN for calling him out in the first place.      [photo via screengrab]      — —      Follow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac      Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com ||||| To some Republican activists, he’s a celebrity defender of the Second Amendment who rallies the base like the rock star he once was.      To Democrats and mainstream Republicans, he’s a sexual “predator,” an affront to families and a flamethrower with an appalling record of incendiary comments.      Text Size -      +      reset      When it comes to Ted Nugent, his conservative fans and liberal detractors are living on different planets.      Nugent catapulted into the spotlight this week when he appeared at two campaign events with Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, the presumptive GOP nominee for governor. Democrats, in Texas and nationally, bracketed the events with email blasts and tweets highlighting elements of Nugent’s unsavory past and record of inflammatory remarks. They plan to continue making hay of those Texas appearances, and relish the possibility of his campaigning with other Republicans.      (Also on POLITICO: Perry has 'problems' with Nugent)      But in the deep-red Lone Star State, registration for Abbott’s events tripled when Nugent’s appearances were announced.      Democrats and Republicans alike see Nugent as a turn-out catalyst, in Texas and perhaps beyond. He outrages Democrats and mainstream Republicans — but he fires up a segment of the GOP base, which is so enamored of Nugent’s fiery anti-Barack Obama rhetoric and defense of gun rights that it can overlook the singer’s tawdry history. A case in point: Sarah Palin wrote on her Facebook page that if Greg Abbott “is good enough for Ted Nugent, he’s good enough for me!”      Nugent, 65, is a board member of the National Rifle Association, and is perhaps one of the country’s most colorful champions of the Second Amendment. He’s a lifelong gun enthusiast, a crusader against drugs and a die-hard Republican. But as Democrats have been eager to point out this week, he’s not exactly a buttoned-up cultural conservative.      (Also on POLITICO: Rand Paul: Nugent should apologize)      In an interview for a VH1 “Behind the Music” documentary about him, Nugent, who hit the peak of his career in the 1970s, acknowledged that when he was young — and even not-so-young — he was “addicted to girls.”      “I was a wang-dang addict, I was addicted to girls. Addicted. It was hopeless,” he said in the video. “It was beautiful.”      By age 21, he had two children from two different women. By 30, after being married, having more kids and getting divorced, he was involved with a 17-year-old, for whom he assumed the mantle — with her parents’ permission — of legal guardian.      “It just really wasn’t a terribly appropriate situation in most people’s eyes,” said Pele Massa in the documentary, who said in the film that at 17 she became romantically involved with Nugent and was with him for nine years, though he wasn’t faithful to her during that period, she said. “And now, it would be criminal.”      (Also on POLITICO: Greg Abbott sings Nugent's praises)      The documentary said he acknowledged several relationships with young women, and that he won parental approval.      There were never criminal charges leveled against him for indiscretions with underage women, the film said, but the incidents have served as fodder for Democrats, who have repeatedly blasted him as a “predator” this week.      “I find Ted Nugent disgusting. And I find it disgusting that Greg Abbott is sharing a stage with him,” wrote Wendy Davis, the Texas Democratic candidate for governor, in a Wednesday fundraising missive. “But this isn’t just about my feelings. Every Texan should be offended by Greg Abbott’s decision to make a predator the new face of his campaign.”      Yet in recent years Nugent has painted himself as a family man. He has always eschewed drugs and alcohol and has been an advocate for keeping kids substance-free.      His current wife, Shemane Nugent, writes on her website that, “Recently, we have discovered four more adult children Ted had from previous relationships. I look forward to getting to know them, and hopefully they will welcome me into their lives.” They have been married since 1989 and have one child together.      “[Like] other marriages, I don’t always agree with everything my husband says or does,” she wrote.      A representative for both Nugents didn’t return a call and emails seeking comment. ||||| Rand Paul continues to win my admiration, I have to say. There are people who come into the Senate with a kind of celebrity status and get lots of good press—one Barack Obama comes to mind—but I can't think of anyone who has gotten so much good press through their own initiative, coming up with one clever way after another to get people to pay attention to them in ways that are almost always positive. His latest move required a subtle ideological tightrope-walk, one that Paul played perfectly. And all it took was a tweet.      This has to do, you'll be happy to know, with Ted Nugent. Republican politicians have a soft spot for Nugent, partly because they're blinded by the celebrity of a guy who 37 years ago had a song that rocketed all the way to #30 on the charts, and partly because Nugent is kind of an expression of the conservative id. I'm sure there are more than a few people on the right who would like to hold up a pair of assault rifles and say, \\"I was in Chicago and said, 'Hey, Obama you might want to suck on one of these you punk.' Obama, he's a piece of shit, and I told him to suck on my machine gun. Let's hear it for him. And then I was in New York. I said, 'Hey, Hillary, you might want to ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless bitch. Since I'm in California, how about Barbara Boxer, she might want to suck on my machine gun. And Dianne Feinstein, ride one of these you worthless whore. Any questions? Freedom!\\" (Oh and also, he brags about having sex with underage girls, but hey, rock 'n roll, right?)      Nugent is in the news because Greg Abbott, the Attorney General of Texas and likely the state's next governor, decided to campaign with him, whereupon people were reminded of a rather nasty, racist thing Nugent said about President Obama last month, and that's causing Abbott to have to deal with some uncomfortable questions. Questions like, \\"Why would you want to campaign with this hateful jackass?\\" Since most of the stories about this don't actually include Nugent's full comments, here's what they were:      I have obviously failed to galvanize and prod, if not shame enough Americans to be ever vigilant not to let a Chicago communist raised communist educated communist nurtured subhuman mongrel like the ACORN community organizer gangster Barack Hussein Obama to weasel his way into the top office of authority in the United States of America. I am heartbroken but I am not giving up. I think America will be America again when Barack Obama, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton, Dick Durbin, Michael Bloomberg and all of the liberal Democrats are in jail facing the just due punishment that their treasonous acts are clearly apparent.      At this point, some conservatives are surely asking themselves whether hanging around with Nugent is worth the trouble, or worth anything at all for that matter. For her part, Sarah Palin hurried to Facebook to say about Abbott, \\"If he is good enough for Ted Nugent, he is good enough for me!\\" But the more common response is the kind we got from Ted Cruz, a rather lengthy \\"Hamana hamana hamana,\\" leading eventually to \\"Those sentiments there, of course I don't agree with them.\\" You can see exactly what's going on in Cruz's head: It's obviously way, way uncool to call our biracial president a \\"subhuman mongrel,\\" but on the other hand, I don't want to give Tea Partiers any reason to suspect even for a moment that I'm not one of them or that I hate Obama any less than they do. Those nuts will turn on you in an instant! Just look what happened to Rubio. The result is some very pained equivocation.      But Rand Paul is much smarter. He knows he isn't going to get the gold medal in the GOP Hate Olympics. Whatever coalition he assembles if and when he runs for president in 2016, it's going to be a relatively diverse one. He won't have complete control of any one constituency. There'll be some libertarians here, some moderates there, some fiscal conservatives here, some isolationists there. And without anyone standing out, at this point the best thing for him may be to raise his profile as high as he can, and get mainstream reporters on his side. So we get this:      Genius. Paul obviously understands that nothing gets attention like criticizing someone on your own side, even if it's someone on the fringe. So what's his reward? Fulsome praise from people on all sides of the aisle! Oodles of good press! Even liberals will write blog posts lauding him! Like the very one you're reading. All of a sudden he looks like the reasonable one, and just look at the results. Here's a piece about him in the Washington Post. Here's an article on Politico. Here's the Huffington Post. Here's the Washington Times. You get the idea.      Rand Paul has never given anyone much reason to believe that he's a sophisticated policy thinker, or that he would be good at running the government. And it's way too early to tell how he'll hold up in the day-in, day-out slog of a presidential campaign, particularly since he has run for office a total of one time in his life. But at the moment, he's shown himself to be smarter about getting media attention than any of the other potential 2016 Republican candidates. By a mile. ||||| While Republican Greg Abbott is fleeing reporter questions about Ted Nugent, Democratic opponent Wendy Davis is invoking the ‘70s guitarist and gun-rights advocate – to raise money. In a new fundraising appeal, Davis says Abbott’s decision to invite Nugent to campaign with him was an insult to “every father, every mother, every family in Texas.”      The outspoken rock musician shared the stage with Abbott on Tuesday, the first day of early voting in the Texas primary elections. Abbott praised Nugent as “a fire for freedom” because of his support of 2nd Amendment rights. Nugent is also an outspoken critic of Democrats with a history of making crude, offensive remarks. He called President Obama a” subhuman mongrel” and has described feminists and female politicians as “varmints” and “fat pigs. He has acknowledged having sex with underage girls — something that runs counter to Abbott’s public promise as attorney general to fight child predators.      Reporters in Tyler tried to ask Abbott on Wednesday about his decision to invite Nugent to campaign with him. But the attorney general fled to a waiting car after a brief round of questions in which he blamed Davis of insufficiently supporting gun-rights. In her fundraising pitch, Davis said she and her Republican opponent have different values.      “His values allow him to embrace an admitted predator who takes advantage of young girls, calls successful women vulgar and disgusting names, and demeans and degrades not just the women of Texas, but anyone who disagrees with his narrow-minded, disrespectful point of view. If this is Greg Abbott’s idea of good Texas values, it’s simply repulsive.      Campaigning with a vile character like Ted Nugent is a window into Greg Abbott’s character. And we need to show him that we won’t tolerate it.      She asks supporters to send money to help her campaign. Davis faces an uphill battle against the better-funded Abbott in a state that hasn’t elected a Democrat governor since Ann Richards in 1990.      But it wasn’t all bad news for Abbott. Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin offered her endorsement. “If he is good enough for Ted Nugent, he is good enough for me!” Palin wrote in a Facebook post.

After his former mentor's death, however, he decides to resume his crime-fighting days as Robin. Remarkably, Grayson does not take up the Nightwing identity. The filmmakers said they chose this because many people outside the comic book community are unfamiliar with Nightwing and they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.Commissioner Gordon is aware of Grayson's secret identity and assists him by supplying official documents. In addition, Gordon provides the voiceover narration at the beginning of the trailer. The head of the investigation into Batman's death is indicated to be Chief O'Hara, a character from the 1960's Batman TV series, who apparently also knows Grayson's identity (noting that Grayson's \\"crimefighting days are over\\") His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with Selina Kyle/Catwoman to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter Clark Kent that he wants \\"him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!\\" O'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon.

Context: Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. Question: Employees feel frustration as: Answer: A:","output":"Employees feel frustration as a result of the growing divide between senior leadership and the folks on the ground, lack of communication, and inability to contribute their creativity and ideas in shaping the organization's work and culture.

It is surrounded by the Southern Ocean and covers an area of approximately 14 million square kilometers, making it the fifth-largest continent. The continent is known for its massive ice cap which is not only the world's largest, but is also the largest single mass of ice on Earth. Antarctica's ice cap contains about 70% of the planet's fresh water and 90% of its ice. An important feature of this ice cap is the Antarctic ice sheet, a thick mass of ice that covers around 98% of the continent's landmass. The ice sheet plays a vital role in regulating the Earth's climate, as it reflects sunlight back into space, which helps keep the Earth cool. The other options provided were: - Asia: This continent is the largest and most populous continent in the world. It is not covered with an ice cap, but certain regions such as parts of the Himalayas are known for their glaciers and perennial snow. - Greenland: While Greenland is often considered to be the world's largest island and is covered by an ice sheet, it is not a continent itself.

To provide a valid answer to the question, it is necessary to discuss some of the critiques that have been made against other streaming services. Some of these criticisms may relate to issues such as artist compensation, sound quality, user experience, and business practices. Here is a more detailed response that addresses these concerns. One primary criticism of some music streaming services is their compensation model for artists, particularly when it comes to smaller, independent musicians. Many have argued that the royalties these platforms pay to artists are insufficient, making it difficult for independent musicians to earn a sustainable living. Some services use a pro-rata model, where the total revenue is divided among all artists based on the proportion of total streams they receive. This model tends to favor more popular artists, leaving newer, lesser-known musicians at a disadvantage. Another criticism lies in the sound quality offered by some streaming services. While many users find the audio quality perfectly acceptable for casual listening, audiophiles can be critical, claiming that the compressed formats used by these platforms do not deliver the level of sound quality found in other formats (e.g., vinyl, CDs, or lossless digital files). Tidal addresses this concern, as it offers a high-fidelity streaming option that provides lossless, CD-quality audio for subscribers with compatible equipment. User experience is another area where streaming services may receive criticism. Some argue that many platforms have limited options for creating and editing playlists or lack advanced search and discovery features. In addition, ads on free tiers can be intrusive and disruptive to the user experience. Some users may feel that the algorithm-driven approach to music discovery can lead to homogenized playlists and make it difficult to find new, diverse artists. Lastly, the business practices and the monopolization of the streaming industry by some major players might not always be viewed positively. Some critics argue that certain companies might not be genuine in their support for independent artists or interested in providing fair compensation, which could result in an environment where only major labels and well-established artists truly benefit from the system. In conclusion, while the sentence provided does not directly address the question about the criticism of other streaming services, it can be a starting point to explore the concerns mentioned above and the aspects where Tidal may position itself differently or better within the industry. Beyoncé's involvement as a co-owner of Tidal signifies that the service might be more artist-oriented and could be addressing some of the critiques currently faced by other streaming platforms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: So long as teachers fail to distinguish between teaching and learning, they will continue to undertake to do for children what only children can do for themselves. Teaching children to read is not passing reading on to them. It is certainly not endless hours spent in activities about reading. Douglas insists that \\"reading cannot be taught directly and schools should stop trying to do the impossible.\\"      Teaching and learning are two entirely different processes. They differ in kind and function. The function of teaching is to create the conditions and the climate that will make it possible for children to devise the most efficient system for teaching themselves to read. Teaching is also a public activity. It can be seen and observed.      Learning to read involves all that each individual does to make sense of the world of printed language. Almost all of it is private, for learning is an occupation of the mind, and that process is not open to public scrutiny.      If teacher and learner roles are not interchangeable, what then can be done through teaching that will aid the child in the quest   for knowledge? Smith has one principal rule for all teaching instructions. \\"Make learning to read easy, which means making reading a meaningful, enjoyable and frequent experience for children.\\"      When the roles of teacher and learner are seen for what they are, and when both teachers and learners fulfill them appropriately, then much of the pressure and feeling of failure for both is eliminated. Learning to read is made easier when teachers create an environment where children are given the opportunity to solve the problem of leaning to read by reading Question: According to the passage, learning to read will no longer be a difficult task when   _  .

Church patriarch in Iraq blames U.S. for Christians’ misery Archbishop Louis Sako is the patriarch of the Iraq-based Chaldean Church, one of the world's most ancient Christian communities. (Haidar Hamdani/AFP/Getty Images) The most senior Christian cleric in Iraq said the United States was \\"indirectly responsible\\" for the current chaos in Iraq, where the advances of Islamic State jihadists over the past few months have led to thousands of deaths and raised charges of ethnic cleansing. In August alone, some 600,000 people were displaced by the violence. \\"[The U.S.] said it would ensure democracy and the well-being of the people. But 10 years have passed, and, on the contrary, we have gone backward,\\" said Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Louis Sako, during a visit to Beirut last week. He added: \\"There were about 1 million Christians in Iraq and more than half of them have been displaced. Only 400,000 are left while displacement is still rising.\\" Sako's denomination is one of the world's most ancient Christian communities. Most are ethnic Assyrians, a group that existed for centuries in what's now modern-day Iraq, Syria and Turkey and preserved their faith and language -- a version of Aramaic -- through the various upheavals and conquests that have shaped and reshaped the Middle East. But their place within the Iraqi state changed radically after the U.S. invasion in 2003. After the toppling of Saddam Hussein, a nominally secular dictator, there was a security vacuum that imperiled Iraq's religious minorities. The new government in Baghdad, dominated by Shiites long repressed by Hussein's regime, failed to build a truly inclusive democracy. Tens of thousands of Chaldeans left the country following attacks on churches and monasteries. Check out a quick snapshot of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in #Iraq Up to 1.8 Million ppl now displaced pic.twitter.com/zuB2w4MmFg In 2008, Sako's predecessor, Mar Emmanuel III Delly, was very clear about what was to blame for his congregation's troubles. \\"The absolute worst time that I’ve seen in my life has been the last five years, “ he told the Detroit Free Press (there's a considerable Assyrian diaspora in Michigan). \\"The occupation has not been good for the Christians and for all of Iraq.\\" Sako has been outspoken about the horrors visited upon Iraq this summer by the Islamic State, whose puritanical brand of Islam has driven it to systematically butcher Christians, Yazidis and others belonging to Iraq's mosaic of minority sects. The jihadists have set about destroying cultural monuments -- tombs and shrines -- that it considers the work of apostates. After the loss of the historic city of Mosul to the Islamic State fighters, Sako offered an apocalyptic lament during a July sermon in Bagdhad, which WorldViews covered: \\"How in the 21st century could people be forced from their houses just because they are Christian, or Shi'ite or Sunni or Yazidi?\\" he asked. \\"Christian families have been expelled from their houses and their valuables were stolen and ...their houses and property expropriated in the name of the Islamic State.\\" [Sako] went on to make a chilling, grand historic proclamation: \\"This has never happened in Christian or Islamic history. Even Genghis Khan or Hulagu didn't do this,\\" he said. Hulagu Khan was the Mongol warlord whose horde swept through Mosul en route to sacking Baghdad in 1258, a bloody slaughter that snuffed out the proud Abbasid caliphate that had flourished there since the 8th century. Baghdad would take hundreds of years to reemerge as a political center. Some 200 Muslims also attended that particular service, according to Reuters, and held up signs in solidarity reading \\"I am Iraqi, I am Christian.\\" But that support belies the larger alienation that Sako says his flock has endured, even as the United States and other allies step up aerial strikes on Islamic State positions in Iraq. \\"Our Muslim neighbors did not help us,\\" he told reporters last month. \\"The West watched us, and it seemed they have ignored our suffering. But we will not leave our land, whatever the sacrifices.\\" Ishaan Tharoor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

Deschamps first game in charge of Juventus was highly successful since Juventus beat U.S. Alessandria Calcio 1912 8-0 in a friendly, but poor results followed as Juventus was knocked out in the 2006-07 Coppa Italia and then drew 1-1 against A.C.

Production de la déclaration de renseignements NR4 Les sociétés de placement à capital variable sont tenues de produire la déclaration NR4 d'ici le 31 mars 2007, pour les distributions déterminées payées aux non-résidents en 2006. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"\\"Production of NR4 Information Return. Mutual Investment Corporations are required to produce the NR4 information return by March 31, 2007, for determined distributions paid to non-residents in 2006.\\" This French sentence pertains to a specific tax document Canadian corporations dealing with non-residents must fill out. Called the NR4 Information Return, this document pertains to taxes withheld from income amounts that are paid or credited to non-residents of Canada. Firstly, let's break down what an NR4 Information Return is. According to Canadian laws, it is a statement regarding any amount that a corporation might have paid or credited to people who are not residents of Canada. This can include any type of income such as retirements benefits, dividends, royalties, commissions, or other types of payments. The NR4 Information Return shows the gross amount of the payment or credit, its net amount, and the tax withheld. Now, from the French sentence, we come to understand that Mutual Investment Corporations are required to fill and file this document. This term may refer to a specific type of investment corporation or company, that pools money from many investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities. The mutual part of the name refers to the fact that all the profits and losses are shared among the investors. The deadline mentioned in the sentence is March 31, 2007. This means that corporations had to provide this information about payments made during the year 2006 by this date. So, if a Mutual Investment Corporation had paid any sort of income to a non-resident in 2006, the corporation had until March 31, 2007, to submit their NR4 Information Document. Thus, to put simply, this sentence mandates that these companies report all payments made to non-residents (like dividends paid to foreign shareholders) for the fiscal year 2006 by March of the following year. The NR4 would include details of the amount paid and the taxes that were withheld at the source."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They took a lot of liberties in rearranging events, excluding people, and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30's. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and W.D. in the gang at various times, and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included.

It was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up, and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly. Clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe.

UPDATED:. 11:50 EST, 13 December 2012. A jeweller fought off a gang of masked raiders who attacked him with a sledgehammer, by hurling gold watches at them. Dramatic CCTV stills show the moment four balaclava-wearing robbers smashed their way into David Nicholl's jewellery shop in Smethwick, West Midlands, at 4.40pm on Saturday. The thieves then smashed glass counters before loading 17 trays of gold jewellery, worth tens of thousands of pounds, into a bag. Scroll down for video. Four balaclava-clad raiders burst into David Nicholls' Smethwick jewellers shop in West Midlands on Saturday armed with sledgehammers. Glass smashes everywhere as robbers help themselves to the trays of jewellery. In the top right of the screen one robber can be seen striking Mr Nicholls with a sledgehammer. Mr Nicholls begins to fight back and despite the grainy footage, you can just make out one robber putting his arms up to defend himself as Mr Nicholls throws heavy gold watches and broken jewellery trays. The armed gang of four decide enough is enough and flee Mr Nicholls' shop, carrying with them a total of 17 trays of jewellery worth tens of thousands of pounds. Shop owner David Nicholls was twice hit over the head with a sledgehammer but incredibly the 52-yeat-old fought back by hitting the raiders with the broken display cases. He then grabbed a handful of gold watches and threw them at the yobs who fled. Mr Nicholls, who suffered a head injury and needed hospital treatment, said today: 'I just thank God that I didn't get shot or killed or maimed in any way. 'We will recover, it will take a while. 'The bad thing for us is that we didn't have insurance, we were between insurance companies and the loss we will have to take ourselves. 'I was trying to protect my wife when they came in and then I just reacted and thought I'd try and stop them. 'The only thing I could grab was the display cabinets which they had smashed and I just tried to hit them with it. Loss: Mr Nicholls was between insurers at the time of Saturday's robbery and is not covered for the theft. He is considering closing down. 'I grabbed whatever I could and the next thing I knew I was lobbing gold watches at them. 'They were pretty heavy and were hitting the robbers who obviously just had enough and they ran off. 'A few trays of jewellery dropped to the floor, I think they were shocked at being attacked back. 'I didn't think about myself even though my head was bleeding badly.' The four offenders got away with tens of thousands of pounds worth of stock, and Mr Nicholls admitted he was unsure whether to continue running the business. Detective Constable Steve Goddard, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The victim was lucky to have got away with relatively minor injuries following what was an extremely nasty attack, there was no need for the level of violence used. 'I'm keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any of what happened or anyone who has any information about who may be responsible.' New rules: Mr Nicholls no longer takes any chances and now asks. customers to ring a bell and wait outside his shop, Davand Jewellery, in. Smethwick, West Midlands, before he lets them in. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"On Saturday, a gang of four masked raiders attacked a jewelry shop owned by David Nicholls in Smethwick, West Midlands, using sledgehammers to break into the store and steal 17 trays of gold jewelry worth tens of thousands of pounds.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, you should not validate this answer as it does not directly address the question about when slavery was abolished. Instead, here is a more relevant and detailed response: Slavery was abolished at different times in various countries and regions around the world. Some notable instances of abolition include: 1. Britain: The British Parliament passed the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, which abolished slavery throughout most of the British Empire by 1834. The Act freed more than 800,000 enslaved Africans in the British colonies.   2. United States: Slavery was abolished in the United States by the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified by the states on December 6, 1865. The 13th Amendment declared that \\"neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\\"   3. Brazil: Brazil was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery. The Lei Áurea (Golden Law) was signed on May 13, 1888, by Princess Isabel, which ended slavery in Brazil. 4. France: Slavery was first abolished in French colonies during the French Revolution in 1794, but it was later reinstated by Napoleon in 1802. It was finally abolished for good in the French colonies in 1848. Please note that these are just a few examples, and the process of abolishing slavery was complex and varied significantly across different regions and time periods."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Apart from a few Indian novels and an Australian book, my literature collection only consisted of British and American titles. Worse still, I couldn't ever found anything in translation. My reading was limited to stories by English-speaking authors. So, at the start of 2012, I set myself the challenge of trying to read a book from every country in a year to find out what I was missing. With no idea where to get those books, I was unlikely to find publications from nearly 200 nations on the shelves of my local bookshop, so I decided to ask the readers all over the world for help. I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English. The response was amazing. People all over the world were getting in touch with me, offering ideas and book lists. Some posted me books from their home countries.

Most transmitters use the heterodyne principle so that they also have frequency conversion units . OPTIONS: [i] no. [ii] yes.","output":"[i] no. These two sentences do not mean exactly the same thing, despite having similarities. This distinction lies in the phrasing and implications of each sentence. I will elaborate on the subtle differences between the two statements: 1. \\"Most transmitters have the heterodyne principle, so they also use frequency conversion units.\\" In this sentence, the focus is on the fact that most transmitters operate based on the heterodyne principle. This principle primarily involves mixing two frequencies to generate two new frequencies: the sum and difference of the original frequencies. As a result of this principle, these transmitters also use frequency conversion units in their operation. The implication here is that the utilization of frequency conversion units is a consequence or a byproduct of the transmitters having the heterodyne principle. 2. \\"Most transmitters use the heterodyne principle so that they also have frequency conversion units.\\" This sentence suggests that most transmitters employ the heterodyne principle specifically for the purpose of having frequency conversion units. In other words, the motivation behind using the heterodyne principle in these transmitters is to possess frequency conversion units as a part of their system. The sentence highlights the intentionality behind including frequency conversion units in the transmitters' design. In summary, the first sentence emphasizes that transmitters operating on the heterodyne principle consequently utilize frequency conversion units, while the second sentence establishes that transmitters deliberately employ the heterodyne principle in order to include frequency conversion units in their design. The difference, albeit subtle, lies in the implications of why and how frequency conversion units are used within the transmitters' systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had an optimistic forecast initially?  After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

Answer:","output":"Pakhomy Andreyushkin was born on 15th May 1865 in Russia. Though not much is known about his early life and upbringing, one can presume that he grew up during a time of significant social and political changes in the country. Like many of his countrymen, Andreyushkin might have experienced the challenges and struggles of the late 19th-century Russian society. As he matured, he likely witnessed advancements in science, technology, and art that characterized the era. As a Russian national, Andreyushkin would be deeply acquainted with the cultural and historical legacy of his homeland. Unfortunately, his life took a dark turn, and he met his end at an unusually young age of 21, as he passed away on 8th May 1887. The Schlisselburg Fortress, where he drew his last breath, held a grim reputation for imprisoning political prisoners and served as a place of execution in Imperial Russia. This leads us to believe that Andreyushkin may have been imprisoned there for reasons related to dissent or opposing views. While no photograph or image can fully capture the essence of a person's life, the only known image of Andreyushkin, andreushkin2.jpg, provides a glimpse into his physical appearance and perhaps an insight into the hardships he faced during his brief life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden.

Afonso de Albuquerque was born in 1453 in Alhandra, near Lisbon. He was the second son of Goncalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Vila Verde dos Francos, and Dona Leonor de Menezes. His father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the Portuguese monarchy. He was educated in mathematics and Latin at the court of Afonso V of Portugal, where he befriended Prince John, the future King John II of Portugal. The fleet left Lisbon on 6 April 1506. Afonso piloted his ship himself, having lost his appointed pilot on departure. In Mozambique Channel, they rescued Captain Joao da Nova, who had encountered difficulties on his return from India; da Nova and his ship, the Frol de la mar, joined da Cunha's fleet. From Malindi, da Cunha sent envoys to Ethiopia, which at the time was thought to be closer than it actually is. Those included the priest Joao Gomes, Joao Sanches and Tunisian Sid Mohammed who, having failed to cross the region, headed for Socotra; from there, Afonso managed to land them in Filuk. After successful attacks on Arab cities on the east Africa coast, they conquered Socotra and built a fortress at Suq, hoping to establish a base to stop the Red Sea commerce to the Indian Ocean. However, Socotra was abandoned four years later, as it was not advantageous as a base.  At Socotra, they parted ways: Tristao da Cunha sailed for India, where he would relieve the Portuguese besieged at Cannanore, while Afonso took seven ships and 500 men to Ormuz in the Persian Gulf, one of the chief eastern centers of commerce. On his way, he conquered the cities of Curiati (Kuryat), Muscat in July 1507, and Khor Fakkan, accepting the submission of the cities of Kalhat and Sohar. He arrived at Ormuz on 25 September and soon captured the city, which agreed to become a tributary state of the Portuguese king.  Hormuz was then a tributary state of Shah Ismail of Persia. In a famous episode, shortly after it's conquest Albuquerque was confronted by Persian envoys, who demanded the payment of the due tribute from him instead. He ordered them be given a stock of cannonballs, arrows and weapons, retorting that \\"such was the currency struck in Portugal to pay the tribute demanded from the dominions of King Manuel\\"  According to Bras de Albuquerque, it was Shah Ismael who coined the term \\"Lion of the seas\\", addressing Albuquerque as such. Afonso began building the Fort of Our Lady of Victory (later renamed Fort of Our Lady of the Conception), engaging his men of all ranks in the work.  However, some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate and, claiming that Afonso was exceeding his orders, departed for India. With the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies, he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz, and then headed to India. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he lose any men on his conquest?","output":"The article does not specifically mention losing any men during Afonso de Albuquerque's conquests. However, it does mention that some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate, and they claimed that Afonso was exceeding his orders. This led to them departing for India, leaving the fleet reduced to two ships and without supplies. This indicates that while there might not be a direct mention of losing men, there was a reduction in his forces during the conquest due to the officers' revolt."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Among the possible answers, a \\"bridge\\" is the most suitable option for being built on a rock foundation. Here's why: 1. Pillars: While pillars can be built on a foundation of rock, they are not standalone structures, and usually serve to support other structures such as buildings and bridges. 2. Mountains and Mountain Ranges: These are natural land formations and not human-built structures, meaning they don't require a foundation of rock to be built on. They do often consist of rock, but they are not intentionally built on a rock foundation. 3. Surface of Earth: Like mountains, the surface of the Earth is a natural formation that does not require a foundation of rock to be built on. Therefore, a bridge is the correct choice because it is a man-made structure that requires a strong and stable foundation, which can be provided by a rock base.

Despite facing numerous challenges, he demonstrated unwavering resolve, ambition, and a penchant for paving his way through adversity. In this article, we explore Herman Cain's pain and struggle, both political and personal. We unravel the various controversies that he braved and how his resilience cemented him as a towering figure within the Republican Party. A Self-Made Man: The Early Years Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Herman Cain's early life was anything but devoid of struggle. As the son of a cleaner and a janitor, he witnessed his parents' tireless work ethic and instilled a strong determination within him. Cain attended the prestigious Morehouse College on a scholarship and earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics. He then went on to attain a master's degree in computer science from Purdue University. Armed with his knowledge and determination, Cain quickly rose through the ranks of corporate America, joining various companies such as The Coca-Cola Company and Pillsbury. He later embarked on a successful career as the CEO of Godfather's Pizza, garnering admiration and respect from industry peers. A Foray into Politics: The Struggle Continues Cain's political journey began in earnest when he was appointed to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's board of directors. His deep understanding of economic principles and business acumen proved invaluable in addressing pivotal economic issues. In 2000, Cain decided to test the political waters in earnest by vying for the Republican presidential nomination. His first foray into politics was short-lived, as he withdrew his candidacy due to insufficient campaign funding. Despite this initial setback, Herman Cain's taste of politics revealed his interest in public service and set the stage for his subsequent expeditions. In 2012, Herman Cain returned to the political arena, armed with considerably more recognition and support. His trademark \\"9-9-9\\" tax plan, charismatic persona, and enthusiasm for politics quickly made him a formidable contender in the Republican presidential race. However, Cain's journey was laden with obstacles and controversy, culminating in painful yet persistent struggles. Mounting Controversies: A Painful Legacy Relentless controversy plagued Cain's presidential campaign in 2011. Sexual harassment allegations from his tenure as CEO of the National Restaurant Association emerged, casting a dark shadow over his campaign. Amid vehement denial, Cain's polls began to plummet, and his popularity waned. The painful revelation of an alleged extramarital affair dealt a final blow to his candidacy, effectively ending his bid for the presidency. It was undeniably painful for Herman Cain to step away from the race after months of feverish campaigning and hard work. Yet, he chose to walk away with dignity and grace, rather than prolong a political spectacle that would inevitably hurt him and his family further. Standing Tall: Cain's Resilience and Legacy Despite the heartache that accompanied the end of his 2012 presidential bid, Herman Cain continued to play a vital role in American politics. He established himself as an influential media figure by hosting \\"The Herman Cain Show,\\" advocating for conservative values, and launching a successful website and radio program. His innate ability to bounce back from adversity, remain steadfast in his beliefs, and work passionately for America speaks volumes about his character. Conclusion As we reflect on the life of the late Herman Cain, one cannot deny the myriad of painful struggles he endured throughout his career. By overcoming adversity, Cain displayed immense strength and fortitude—qualities that endeared him to many of his supporters. As he fought the battle against stage four colon cancer, Cain's resilience remained unwavering, and his pursuit of improving America's trajectory continued to guide his actions. Though an article cannot fully capture the essence of Herman Cain's journey, it is crucial to acknowledge and appreciate his courage and persistence in the face of numerous hardships. Cain's life story remains an inspiration to those who find themselves surrounded by adversity and reveals the power of resilience that lies within the human spirit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Kay Hagan's campaign said late Wednesday the North Carolina Democrat missed a classified hearing last winter on the threat from the terrorist group ISIS to go to New York to raise money for her re-election. Hagan admitted earlier this week she didn't attend a hearing because she went to the fundraiser but didn't disclose which hearing she missed. Her decision to skip the Armed Services Committee session -- at which high-level administration intelligence officials filled in senators on top secret details about the group -- is drawing fire from her Republican opponent, North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis, who is narrowly trailing her in recent polls. But one of the dirty little truths about the way","output":"the Senate operates is that many senators often miss classified hearings or committee meetings due to conflicting priorities, such as raising campaign funds, attending to constituent needs, or participating in other Senate-related responsibilities. While it can be criticized as neglecting their duties, it is an unfortunate reality of the political process. Many senators face these hard decisions when balancing their time between committee work and running a successful re-election campaign. The pressure to raise funds can be immense, as it is often seen as a key predictor of electoral success. However, missing important hearings, especially those related to national security, can negatively impact a senator's public image and give their opponents easy ammunition to attack their credibility. In the case of Sen. Hagan, her choice to attend a fundraiser instead of the classified ISIS hearing has provided her Republican opponent, Thom Tillis, with a talking point to question her commitment to national security and the well-being of her constituents. As the race remains close in the polls, both candidates must weigh their priorities carefully, as any perceived misstep could significantly sway voters. To avoid similar situations in the future, senators should strive to find a better balance between fulfilling their Senate duties and engaging in fundraising activities, or even explore alternative methods of campaign financing. However, as long as the current system emphasizes the importance of fundraising, senators are likely to continue facing these difficult choices and prioritizing their political survival over committee attendance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the conference room table was White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten. Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called \\"a quiet moment,\\"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out.

Q: I never have feed a baby something that they shouldn’t have but I know of an instance where someone did… A neighbor of Mine was babysitting for her granddaugther. The mother had placed a water bottle filled with VODKA in the refrigerator. The grandmother used that VODKA to fill the bottle with the powder added. At some point after the baby wouldn’t drink the bottle (because of the taste I imagine) but had drank some the Grandmother realized it was Vodka instead of WATER. She gave the baby Powdered Charcoal and the baby vomited the milk mix up. The baby was Ok and no harm done. She was lucky to have the powdered charcoal around. It is hard to find now in the stores. When I was a child (50’s-60) it was common for All medicine chests to be supplied with Charcoal. I still keep some of that in My medicine chest. I live in a rural area. It would take me 45 minutes to get to a Medical facility. An ambulance takes 14 minutes to get to my house and 45 minutes to get to a hospital. Now I can say that I have feed babies things that are not recommended at their age. For example, If a baby is not getting full feeling off of just formula, I would make rice cereal and feed the baby that. Some babies are just to big to be satisfied on just milk. Rice is a good filler and does No harm. (like I would not use wheat cereal) I also would give a baby warm tea when they had a stomach ache. Tea of course has caffeine in it.

A: Choose your answer from: [i] Pond; [ii] Lake; [iii] Lagoon; [iv] resevoirs; Answer:","output":"A man-made lake is commonly referred to as a reservoir. So, the answer is [iv] reservoirs.  Reservoirs serve multiple purposes and can significantly contribute to water resources management, flood control, power generation, recreation, and environmental protection. They are typically created by constructing a dam across a river or stream, which in turn causes the water to back up behind the structure and form a lake. These lakes can vary in size, depending on the intended use of the reservoir and the surrounding landscape.  Functionally, reservoirs can be classified into various types, such as storage reservoirs, balancing reservoirs, and service reservoirs. Storage reservoirs primarily manage water supply and maintain water level over a period of time to ensure the availability of water during dry seasons or droughts. Balancing reservoirs are created to manage fluctuations in water flow and demand, such as the daily or seasonal variations in water supply and consumption. Service reservoirs, on the other hand, are smaller reservoirs located near the point of water consumption, often within urban areas, and help maintain water pressure in distribution systems and allow for regular maintenance of the water supply infrastructure. Reservoirs can also be categorized by their method of water impoundment, such as embankment dams, gravity dams, or arch dams. Each type has specific design and structural characteristics, depending on factors such as the volume of water to be stored, the underlying geology of the area, and the surrounding environment. Man-made lakes can also serve as recreational areas, offering opportunities for boating, fishing, and swimming, as well as providing habitat for a diverse range of flora and fauna. Wildlife conservation and ecological enhancement are important aspects to consider during the planning and management of reservoirs. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the construction of reservoirs can have both positive and negative consequences. While they provide valuable resources and services, such as water and power supply or flood control, they can also lead to the displacement of communities and the loss of cultural, historical, or archaeological sites, as well as changes in habitat and biodiversity. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach should be adopted when planning and constructing reservoirs to ensure a balance between human needs and environmental sustainability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: ISIS battle deserters could soon be flooding to Britain, it's feared And security bosses left asking 'what can we possibly do with the child soldiers?' BRIT security services are preparing for a flood of fleeing home-grown jihadists as ISIS continues to be pounded by air strikes from the US-led coalition and Russia. Although the Islamist group has suffered increasingly from desertion in recent months, up until now very few of the foreign fighters have returned to Europe from Syria and Iraq. The numbers coming to Britain for instance, The Independent has learned, have been in no more than single figures for the last eight months. But that trickle could soon turn into a flood if ISIS continues to lose territory and suffer more heavy losses in Syria. These radicalised warriors will present a severe threat in the near future, “a ticking time bomb” as they try to break out of the region, say security officials. And they insist a coordinated policy is needed to confront the impending crisis. The problem has been compounded by a dramatic and sickening increase in the use of children, including those of Western parentage, by ISIS to carry out executions of prisoners. A photo appeared last week of a young boy, said to be British, in the act of shooting Kurdish fighters captured by Isis. The 11-year-old, it has been claimed, was the son of Sally Jones, a British woman who had converted to Islam and joined ISIS in Syria. The terror group is believed to have around 1,500 child fighters in its ranks. The vast majority are Syrian and Iraqi, with Yemen and Morocco supplying most from Arab countries. There are also around 50 children from Britain are currently in the self-declared “Islamic State”, along with smaller numbers from France and Australia, among Western countries. “What one does with these children need to be considered,” said a senior British security official. “Some of them have who have been used to carry out these criminal acts are below the age of criminal responsibility in many countries in Europe. “We know of children from the West who had been taken to Syria, but there are also children who have been born there to European parents. As we know Daesh (ISIS) are now bringing five-year-olds into their jihad. “But the real problem would be with the thousands of adults. A number of states are liaising on this, but the policies will depend to an extent on political and legal considerations in individual states.” Around 27,000 foreign fighters are believed to have joined Isis since the start of Syria’s civil war five years ago, with between 5,000 and 7,000 of them arriving from Europe to join the group and other hardline rebel organisations such as Jabhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda affiliate. Just under 800 have travelled from the UK. Jihadists have been using the Turkish border to get in and out of Syria, sometimes with the connivance, it has been claimed, of the Erdogan government. But the Turks are now carrying out military operations against Isis, and its militants have now lost control of points they had occupied in the area. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article discusses the fear that Britain may soon face an influx of home-grown jihadists and child soldiers returning from ISIS-controlled territories in Syria and Iraq. Security services are concerned about the potential threats these radicalized warriors pose, describing them as a \\"ticking time bomb.\\" ISIS has notably increased its use of child soldiers, with around 1,500 in its ranks, including approximately 50 from Britain.  The article highlights some key points: 1. As ISIS continues to lose territory due to airstrikes from the US-led coalition and Russia, security officials fear an increased flow of foreign fighters returning to Europe, primarily Britain. 2. There has been a rise in the use of child soldiers, including those of Western parentage, by ISIS for carrying out executions. 3. It is believed that there are around 1,500 child fighters within ISIS, with a majority being Syrian and Iraqi, while children from Britain, France, and Australia are also present. 4. Deciding how to manage the return of these child soldiers is a complicated issue, as some are below the age of criminal responsibility in multiple European countries. 5. Approximately 27,000 foreign fighters are believed to have joined ISIS since the start of Syria's civil war, with around 5,000 to 7,000 coming from Europe, and just under 800 from the UK. Understanding and responding to these critical issues in the article is essential for security officials and policymakers to develop appropriate strategies to manage the potential influx of returning jihadists and child soldiers in a way that balances legal, political, and safety concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Five-year-old Raghat loved singing, nail polish, teasing her toddler sister, the alphabet she was starting to learn at nursery, and goofing for the camera. In the last photos of her, taken barely 10 minutes before the Russian bombs landed, she shows off a new bracelet and freshly painted nails with glee, then squeezes a kiss from her squirming baby sister. “I only took my children back to Syria for six days,” says her mother, Suheer, her eyes welling up as she plays a video on her smartphone, bringing a shadow of her daughter momentarily back to life. Her son Hossein, only four himself, leans in to smooth away her tears. Too young to really understand why his sister has vanished, he comforts his mother with a soft patter of “mummy, no, mummy”. Related: Ministers say it could take two years to destroy Isis Raghat now lies miles away, across the Turkish border in Syria, buried in the town of Habeet, near Idlib, where she died in October alongside her grandfather and her cousin Ahmad. When the attack finished she was found wrapped in Ahmad’s arms. A 28-year-old maths teacher, he had tried to race her to shelter when the first bomb fell. They made it to a small dugout in the garden, but a bomb landed just beside the entrance, and Ahmad’s body was not a strong enough shield. Raghat survived the first blast, but died on the back of a motorbike as her family raced her to hospital. “We were supposed to be going home the next day,” Suheer says. “My husband never saw his daughter again.” The family are one of hundreds ripped apart by more than two months of intense Russian bombing raids on opponents of President Bashar al-Assad, which victims and fighters say have strayed far behind frontlines. Coalition airstrikes led by the US have also killed civilians, but have stricter rules of engagement. There have been no reports of civilian casualties from the airstrikes launched on the al-Omar oilfield by British Tornado jets this week. Syrians say Russians are not only reckless about choosing targets, but also appear to be intentionally bombing some civilian areas. Survivors, doctors treating the injured, and local commanders believe the Sukhoi jets, flying from a new airbase in the coastal Latakia province, are hitting homes in a deliberate campaign to break fighters’ morale and depopulate swaths of the countryside. “They are targeting the civilians at night, and mostly frontlines during the day,” says Abu Hussain, a Turkmen rebel commander, a high-rank defector from the Syrian army. “It’s because they don’t want anyone to film the jets bombing at night, so you can’t prove their identity.” That matches images and accounts of the airstrike on Raghat’s house, which her uncle Ali says began moments after 9pm on 1 October. In one of her last photographs, she holds a lit torch, and video her uncle says was shot soon after the bombing shows flames raging through the house against a dark sky. Russian airstrikes killed at least 295 Syrian civilians in October alone, according to monitoring group Airwars, which keeps an extensive database of images, videos, reports and biographies of the dead. “Based on all field reporting, the number of alleged civilian casualties attributed to Russia is many times what we see being claimed against the US-led coalition,” says Chris Woods, who runs the Airwars project. “We think the primary reason here that the casualties are so high is the type of munitions that Russia is using, mostly ‘dumb bombs’ which almost always mean more civilian deaths. That is closely followed by where and how Russia is bombing. There is no doubt that Russia is bombing civilian neighbourhoods.” Airwars’ assessment of the strike on Habeet matches Raghat’s family’s account, and ties in with Russian reports of bombing raids in the area, it says. A Syrian monitoring group also confirmed details of the attack, and a prominent human rights activist still working inside Syria videotaped the aftermath and photographed the little girl’s body. The family, who asked for their surname to be withheld to protect relatives still in Syria, did not expect a bombing raid even though Russian planes had been buzzing around the area for four days, apparently doing surveillance. President Vladimir Putin had said his fighters would be targeting “terrorist groups”, and the family’s home was more than 60 miles (97km) from the nearest Isis forces. Related: At least 18 people killed in Russian airstrike on town in Syria – reports Even as it became clear that Russian planes were more focused on tackling Assad’s opponents than Isis, the frontline was still several miles away. It would take days for civilians to realise they were firmly in the bombers’ sights, because of confusion about targets and the slow and unreliable trickle of news out of Syria. Many working in overwhelmed hospitals, providing relief or ferrying the worst injured across the border into Turkey, fear the deaths have barely registered in western capitals obsessed with tackling Isis and almost oblivious to the civilian deaths caused by Russian bombing. “Its been 48 days with no one talking about it,” says Abu Hamza Suleiyman, a doctor at a Syrian field hospital near the town of Jisr al-Shughur, another area targeted by Russian bombers. “There are almost no civilians left in their homes because they bombed almost every single village. “I could understand the frontline, but the civilians? One landed just outside a maternity hospital. This is the worst experience in the last four years. I’m from a small village in these mountains, and for ages no one has bombed this village, but when the Russians started bombing they hit every single village.” The killings already appear to be entrenching the war and fuelling radicalisation. Anti-Assad fighters seeking revenge and disturbed by the flagging strength of their own groups, seek to ally with opposition forces that are well-supplied and confident in Syria – among them Isis. “Isis are not very good, but a lot of people think they are doing the correct thing against the regime,” says Raghat’s uncle Ali, a fighter with the Free Syrian Army whose two younger brothers now want to join him on the frontlines to avenge their family. Ali, who was not at home when the strike hit, fears other families may look for even more radical solutions. “There is no Isis in our area at all, but there is going to be soon,” he says. Ali’s father, 56-year-old Abdul Razzaq, was one of the first civilian victims of the Russian raids, hit in the Habeet strike as he tried to race down from the top storey of the house. Most of the family were already downstairs and managed to dash to safety, leaving only Raghat, her cousin and 49-year-old grandmother, Zahra, who had been in another part of the house and decided to head for the dugout in the yard. As they fled, a shell landed just behind Zahra, knocking her to the ground, destroying her hearing and peppering her with shrapnel. It nearly killed her, but probably also saved her life, because just as Ahmad and Raghat thought they had reached safety, another blast hit the shelter directly. Zahra’s search for treatment took a long, painful night of racing across northern Syria, on roads so bad she broke an arm, because some hospitals have been targeted in airstrikes and others are overwhelmed by casualties of the bombings. Related: 'More than 90%' of Russian airstrikes in Syria have not targeted Isis, US says Ali rushed her 15 miles to the nearest medical station, but doctors there could do little more than stabilise her for a three-hour drive to the Turkish border, in an ambulance that was more like a truck. A drive in darkness, haste and confusion was followed by three hours waiting at the border for Zahra, moaning in pain and terrified she was dying. They were finally escorted across the border to begin treatment, but two months later she still has no movement in one arm, and can barely walk because the sores and burns on her legs are yet to heal. They were only in the path of the bombs because the war has dragged on so long. The whole extended family fled to Turkey in 2012, but two years ago pension payments to Abdul Razzaq, a retired officer in the Syrian military, were stopped by the government. They could no longer afford rent. But, anxious to avoid the grim refugee camps and reassured that their home was under firm rebel control and had never been bombed or taken by the regime, they decided to risk returning. Only Suheer stayed with her husband, who had found a job in Turkey. She missed her parents and siblings badly, though, and after two years persuaded her husband to let her take the children back to celebrate Eid. They crossed back into Syria days before the Russian campaign began. Raghat died in new holiday clothes and a bead bracelet bought by a favourite aunt, Rasmea, who studied computer engineering before the war. “We were shopping, came home, did some pictures, and then – the end,” Rasmea says. She still wears her niece’s bracelet, faded now to dull browns and blacks. Her Facebook profile picture is a montage of images of Raghat, both radiant in life and mutilated in death. “Why are the Russians bombing Syrian people? What have we done wrong?” she says, on the verge of tears. “We want people to see what is happening in Syria, please tell the world.”","output":"A Little Girl's Story: How Raghat's Life Was Taken by Russian Bombs in Syria"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Thereupon, 12,000 Swedish troops were transferred to the Duchy of Bremen by the end of the year. In January 1666, Carl Gustaf Wrangel departed from Swedish Pomerania to command the Swedish army, which in early 1666 numbered 14,000 troops. By summer, all of the city of Bremen's territory was occupied, except the city itself. The Swedish chancellor of Bremen-Verden, Esaias von Pufendorf, went to the court in Paris to build an alliance with France. The Swedish position was that France had to intervene on the Swedish side, since Bremen was Swedish according to the Peace of Westphalia, of which France was a guarantor. Pufendorf was however told by Hugues de Lionne that France would not hesitate to declare openly that she read the treaty as Bremen being an Imperial city, rather than provoke a new great war with the Holy Roman Empire and the Dutch Republic with an assault Sweden and France could hardly win. Lionne said Sweden would be better off waiting for a situation when the Dutch and the neighboring German principalities were weak, and then take the city of Bremen by surprise.

The European Economic Community, also known as the Common Market, was created with the intention of fostering economic cooperation among its member nations. It was established by the Treaty of Rome on March 25, 1957, and comprised six founding member states: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany.  Luxembourg, a small landlocked country in western Europe, has played a crucial role in European economics and politics since the inception of the EEC. It boasts a strong and diversified economy, with key sectors including finance, steel, chemicals, and information technology. Luxembourg has developed a reputation as an essential hub for international financial services and investment funds. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is home to the European Court of Justice, the European Investment Bank, and other essential EU institutions. The EEC aimed to encourage trade, eliminate tariff barriers, create a common market, and enhance economic integration among its member countries. This goal was accomplished through various policies, such as harmonization of legislation, economic policies, and the establishment of institutions like the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. The EEC transitioned into the European Union (EU) with the signing of the Maastricht Treaty (also known as the Treaty on European Union) on November 1, 1993. This marked the beginning of increased political and social integration, culminating in the adoption of a single currency, the Euro, and the implementation of additional freedoms and rights for EU citizens. Luxembourg remains an integral part of the European Union today, maintaining its role as a key financial center and continuing to contribute to the evolution and development of the political and economic landscape of the union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Personally Nike is my favorite one--it's so simple. And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for  35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped  signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's \\" rainbow apple\\", a rainbow- colored silhouette    of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926. Adidas The Adidas logo, which was created by the founder of the company Adi Dassler, represents mountains,... Question: What does the author think of the stories of the great logos?

By Marianne Power PUBLISHED: 16:29 EST, 7 August 2013 | UPDATED: 16:54 EST, 7 August 2013 Marianne Power tests two different 'seasonal' Spanx The wedding was straight out of the pages of a magazine. The bride wore Fendi, the vows were exchanged in a garden overlooking Lake Como and the lunch was five courses of pure heaven. But the thing I remember most about my friend's perfect wedding last summer is just how hot I was. It's not that the temperatures were particularly scorching - in the pleasant mid-20s at most - but I still spent the celebration sweating like a pig on a spit, and looking about as attractive as one. By the end of the day I was so hot and bothered I was ready to pass out.

In this case, Marianne Power experimented with two different 'seasonal' Spanx to see if they would offer better comfort and support when attending such events, especially in warmer conditions.  It is important to choose the right level of support when it comes to shapewear. Spanx, for example, is known for their different levels of support, ranging from light to medium to strong. In Marianne Power's test, she found out that Spanx only offered the medium support in the selected product. This means that they are lightweight in more ways than one, meaning they may not have provided enough support for your needs.  It might have been beneficial for you to consider a product like Skinny Britches, which also offers medium support but might be more lightweight and breathable in warmer climates. The choice of shapewear for an event like a summer wedding should take into consideration the expected temperature, humidity, and the material of your clothing. When attending a summer event or a wedding in a picturesque location such as Lake Como, comfort and breathability should be prioritized. You may want to research different brands and products specifically designed for warmer climates. Look for materials that are moisture-wicking, lightweight, and breathable, which can help regulate body temperature and avoid discomfort caused by excessive sweating. In the future, when attending similar events, it would be advisable to consider investing in shapewear specifically designed for warmer weather or try opting for light support options that offer more breathability to avoid feeling too hot and bothered. Some additional tips for staying comfortable in warm weather include wearing light-colored clothing, staying hydrated, and using cooling accessories, such as handheld fans or cooling scarves. By following these suggestions, you should be able to enjoy outdoor weddings or events without worrying about heat-induced discomfort, allowing you to focus on the celebration at hand."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Roy Hodgson has hit back at Brendan Rodgers' claims that he ignored advice from Liverpool over Daniel Sturridge's recovery time. Rodgers was furious when Sturridge injured his thigh during the last England get together and he hasn't played since the 1-0 victory over Norway early last month. The Liverpool manager insisted that Sturridge needs 48 hours to recover after a match, but Hodgson ignored the advice and forced the striker to train. Daniel Sturridge was injured in training for England in September resulting in him missing the opening European Championship qualifier against Switzerland and a number of Liverpool matches. Hodgson said: 'We have only a shortage of time. We have two games and two training sessions, we wanted to play him and Rooney together against Switzerland. 'The injury was unfortunate but if I am going to be under pressure to give players two days off every time they play then we won't train. They can't have two days off. 'He has not played for Liverpool since picking up the injury. If he was to get fitter during the international week then he will still have a lot of work to do to bring him up to speed for Liverpool anyway. There was no question of him being selected. Hodgson denied that there is any problem between him and Brendan Rodgers after the Liverpool manager warned him not to play Daniel Sturridge. The England boss has not selected the striker for his squad to face San Marino and Estonia in their Euro 2016 qualifiers. Rodgers said that he had told Hodgson that Sturridge was not available for the national team, even though he could play some part of Liverpool's match against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday before the England squad meet up. Talking at Melwood, the Liverpool boss said: 'I've not spoken to Daniel (about the situation). My focus is on Liverpool, it is not on England. 'I spoke to him about being available for Liverpool but I can't think about England when he is not ready to play for Liverpool. England boss Roy Hodgson has insisted players can not have two days off due to the proximity of matches. 'He's had a grade one injury for four weeks, which is a long time, and my focus is now getting him to play for Liverpool. 'I've had good communication with Roy. It was amicable. There is no issue. 'We spoke at length yesterday on the situation and I said to him 'Every individual player is different'. 'I respect he had work to do internationally but my thoughts are with Liverpool players and what their needs are. 'We agreed it was probably too soon for Daniel to meet up with England, irrespective of whether he was involved this weekend or not. He hasn't trained with the team at all since the injury with them and it was probably not the right time to go with them.' While there is no issue between himself and Hodgson, Rodgers wouldn't dismiss questions surrounding the two pairs of medical staff being at loggerheads. 'It is not something to be discussed now,' he said. 'I don't think the same thing will happen again. From the conversations with Roy they will obviously look at that. 'I understand his position where he has only a few days to work with the players and he will probably take away that intensity on that second day but you can still work players, we work players here on the second day, but it needs to be tapered to the individual player.' Liverpool striker Sturridge has only managed to appear in half of his side's Premier League matches. Brendan Rodgers told Hodgson that Sturridge would not be available for England but could play some part in Liverpool's match against West Brom before the national team meet up. Hodgson added: 'The last thing you want is injuries in training. You feel a responsibility to the clubs when you have their players and I can only think of three injuries with the national team in two and a half years I have been in charge. 'I haven't been told he can't play for us. We have a right to pick players and we have a right to check on their fitness and assess them ourselves. It's never happened in my two-and-a-half years and hope it never will. The way forward is to have dialogue with managers and players. 'If he took some part at the weekend it'll be very much at the beginning of his recovery. Us going forward in December and March, a fully fit Sturridge is what I need. 'I don't seek ways in which I can assert my authority. I'm happy with the way I use my authority.'

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Was the honoree of the Earl Haig memorial a junior or senior officer of the British Army? Answer:","output":"The honoree of the Earl Haig Memorial, Field Marshal Douglas Haig, was a senior officer of the British Army who ascended through the ranks and held significant positions during his military career. Although he started as a junior officer like any other military personnel, he eventually held some of the most critical posts in the British Army during his tenure, making him an influential figure in modern British military history. Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, was born on June 19, 1861, in Edinburgh, Scotland. He joined the British Army as a junior officer after graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was initially commissioned as a lieutenant in the 7th (Queen's Own) Hussars in 1885. Throughout his career, Haig served in various capacities in multiple countries, including India, Egypt, Sudan, and South Africa. As Haig progressed through various ranks, his roles and responsibilities grew, marking his transition from a junior officer to a senior one. He furthered his military education at the Staff College, Camberley, which would enable him to assume more senior positions within the British Army. In 1906, Haig was promoted to the rank of Major-General and appointed the Director of Military Training at the War Office. This responsibility marked a pivotal point in Haig’s career, further solidifying his status as a senior officer. During World War I, Haig's notable senior positions within the British Army included the following: 1. Commander of the British I Corps - Haig was appointed to this position in August 1914 at the start of the war, responsible for the leadership of a significant segment of British troops on the Western Front. 2. Commander of the British First Army - In December 1914, Haig was promoted to the rank of General and was placed in charge of the British First Army. 3. Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) - From 1915 until the end of World War I, Haig served as the Commander-in-Chief of the BEF. He led British forces in various crucial battles, including the Battle of the Somme (1916), the Third Battle of Ypres (1917), and the Hundred Days Offensive (1918), which led to victory and the end of the war. Following his contributions during World War I, Haig was promoted to Field Marshal in 1917 and created Earl Haig and the Viscount Dawick in 1919. He continued to serve the British Army until his retirement in 1921. In summary, although Field Marshal Douglas Haig began his career as a junior officer, he ascended through the ranks and became one of the most senior officers of the British Army. His contributions to the British military, both in times of war and peace, earned him prominent positions in the armed forces, including that of the commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force during World War I. Thus, the honoree of the Earl Haig memorial can be accurately described as a senior officer of the British Army."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(Associated Press)      \\"Now, instead of scaly animals portrayed as usually drab creatures, we have solid evidence for a fluffy colored past,\\" reports Mark A.

They were preserved in amber found in western Canada, researchers led by Ryan C. McKellar of the University of Alberta report in Friday's edition of the journal Science.      Amber, hardened tree resin, preserved a mixture of feathers from 70 million years ago. Other feathers contained in amber dating to 90 million years ago are less diverse.      Specimens include simple filament structures similar to the earliest feathers of non-flying dinosaurs _ a form unknown in modern birds _ and more complicated bird feathers \\"displaying pigmentation and adaptations for flight and diving,\\" the researchers reported.      Indications of feathers have been found on much older fossils, and the new discoveries indicate feathers continued to develop into modern form before the extinction of dinosaurs, explained Norell, who was not part of the research team.      A separate report by Roy A. Wogelius of the University of Manchester, England, published online June 30 by Science, reports the finding of trace metals in feather fossils, suggesting their colors included black, brown and a reddish-brown.      \\"Despite many reports over the past decade of feathered dinosaurs and new birds from China, only now are we beginning to understand just how diverse feather types were\\" millions of years ago, Norell said.      ___      http://www.sciencemag.org ||||| A trove of ancient feathers both primitive and complex is providing scientists with an unprecedented snapshot of what some dinosaurs and birds looked like during the Cretaceous period.            An account published online Thursday in the journal Science describes a host of feathers and feather-like filaments found in western Canada. The structures were ensconced in 70-million-year-old amber.      Taken together, the feathers and filaments point to the diversity of this prehistoric plumed menagerie, said study coauthor Alexander Wolfe, a paleoecologist at the University of Alberta in Canada.            \\"The simplest feathers are of greatest interest because these protofeathers have been inferred to be the evolutionary precedent to evolved feathers,\\" Wolfe said in an interview with The Times.            Scientists have posited that feathers developed first as single, hair-like protrusions meant for insulation, then began to grow in clumps, and then as increasingly complex structures. At some point, they were probably used for other purposes (such as attracting mates), and later for flight.            Many of the samples described in the study accurately match one of those stages. Some feathers even had coiled barbules, similar to those that have evolved on modern birds such as sandgrouses, which allow the animals to transport water to the nest to cool their incubating eggs.            \\"We never thought we'd have fossils to show all these feathers, from primitive stage-one [protofeathers] to feathers of modern aspect,\\" Mark Norell, chairman of the division of paleontology at the American Museum of the Natural History, said in an interview with The Times. He was not involved in the study.

Credit: Science ||||| By Hans Villarica      Protofeather fossils discovered entombed in amber from the Late Cretaceous era support theories of dinosaur and avian evolution -- and make for one beautiful gallery      Dinosaur and bird feathers preserved in amber from a Late Cretaceous site in Canada reveal new insights into the structure, function, and color of animals that date back to about 78 million years ago.      Researchers led by University of Alberta paleontologist Ryan McKellar say these specimens represent distinct stages of feather evolution, from early-stage, single filament protofeathers to much more complex structures associated with modern diving birds. After analyzing the preserved pigment cells, the authors add that these feathered creatures may have also had a range of transparent, mottled, and diffused colors, similar to birds today. They can't determine which feathers belonged to birds or dinosaurs yet, but they did observe filament structures that are similar to those seen in other non-avian dinosaur fossils. Their findings appear in the current issue of the journal Science.      In the gallery below, with captions from McKellar, marvel at the beauty of these amber-preserved feathers. Then, in the Q&A that follows, learn more about how amber preservation works, the science of feather evolution, and the possibility of Jurassic Park-type experiments down the line.      How significant is this discovery?      This discovery is a pretty significant find. It supports a model for the evolution of feathers that has previously relied on compression fossils that are difficult to interpret and have been hotly debated.      Also, the amber-entombed feathers show that some of the most primitive feather types, also known as protofeathers, were still around just before the dinosaurs went extinct. They existed alongside feathers that are nearly identical to those of modern birds. Given what we know about the animals that were alive in the area at the time, it is reasonable to suggest that the protofeather-like specimens are attributable to dinosaurs and are the first specimens of this type of feather to be recovered from amber.      How does amber preservation work exactly?      Preservation in amber can vary quite a bit among deposits. Amber tends to preserve specimens in great detail because tree resin has antibacterial and drying properties that partially mummify inclusions and slow the initial onslaught of decay. Over many years, the resin polymerizes, turning into a plastic-like substance that is quite resilient, but burial usually results in heating that can have a profound effect on the inclusions over the span of millions of years.      The Canadian amber insect inclusions are largely preserved as hollow voids in the amber, with a thin film of carbonized, coal-like material, where the outside of the insect once was. The feathers appear to have fared much better, because they are fine and are not composed of material that decay easily. That said, many of the specimens show signs of partial decay, and there is no indication of how much, if any, original material remains intact.      What's the backstory of these specimens?      What originally got me interested in this project was a single feather fragment trapped in a spider web that had been given to Dr. Brian Chatterton. For my Ph.D. project, I worked on tiny, less than three millimeter, parasitic wasps trapped within amber from the same deposit. As part of this project I was able to go through the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology collection of 3,000 or so inclusions in great detail. After finding a lot of feather fragments in this collection, I had the good fortune of meeting the Leuck family, amateur collectors in southern Alberta, who donated a pair of additional specimens to the University of Alberta. Later, we learned that Dr. Philip Currie was also examining a trio of specimens from the deposit. We pooled the material, creating a surprisingly rich snapshot of feathers in the Late Cretaceous.      This project underlines the importance of maintaining museum collections as well as the role that interested amateurs can play in palaeontology. Without these, there is no way that we would have been able to observe these important specimens.      According to your paper, these feathers represent several distinct stages of feather evolution. Could you explain each stage briefly?      The evolutionary-developmental model is an attempt to explain how the transition from small hair-like feathers to modern feathers with multiple tiers of branching occurred. A quick account of modern feather anatomy would go like this: Feathers have a central shaft called the rachis. Off of this shaft branch the tufts, which in turn branch off into small structures called barbules that are segmented like bamboo shoots.      Stage 1 consists of individual filaments that are comparable to hair in terms of overall appearance. Stage 2 consists of multiple filaments that arise from a single base, forming barbs. Stage 3 is where feathers become branched structures, either by forming segmented barbules on their barbs or by forming barbs on their central shaft, the rachis, and then combining these features to make two tiers of branching. Stage 4 is where the barbules on each side of the barb were altered to connect barbs together and form a sheet or vaned feather. Stage 5 encompasses a wide range of finer alterations that actually permit powered flight and a wide range of additional uses for feathers.      The notion of dinosaur specimens preserved in amber reminds me of Jurassic Park. Would what happened in that movie be plausible? What can we look forward to learning?      Put simply, no. The specimens that we examined are extremely small and would not be expected to contain any DNA material. To put this into context, the only genetic material that has been recovered from amber is from lumps of mummified insect muscle tissue in much younger Dominican amber that are approximately 17 million years old and well after the age of dinosaurs.      If we are able to obtain more material, we would really like to examine the chemical makeup of the protofeather-like specimens, as well as the pigments found within these specimens and other feathers. It would then be possible to investigate how much of the original feather material remains intact and gain a better understanding of the feathers' colors.      Unfortunately, these investigations rely on being able to create small breaks within some of the specimens and examine them under very high magnifications, such as scanning electron microscopy, so they are not possible with the limited number of specimens that are currently available. A larger collection may also allow us to verify some of the other stages in feather evolution. ||||| Photo      Color is coming to the formerly black-and-white Mesozoic world of dinosaurs and early birds.      Not exactly high-definition color, and some formidable characters may show up in the same old drab and scaly wardrobes; they are dinosaurs, after all, with a reputation for resistance to change. But in time, you can look for splashes of color in museum dioramas of feathered figures from the age of dinosaurs.      For more than a decade, hardly a season has passed without more discoveries of dinosaur and bird fossils in China bearing impressions of feathers and traces of chemical coloring agents. Now, in Canada, paleontologists have found 70-million-year-old amber preserving 11 specimens showing a wide diversity of feather types at that time.      One specimen of so-called proto-feathers had a single bristlelike filament and some simple clusters. Others were complex structures with hooklike barbules that act like Velcro; in modern birds, this keeps feathers in place during dives. Still other specimens revealed feather patterns for flight and underwater diving.      Preserved pigment cells encased in the amber, along with other evidence, suggested that the feathered animals had an array of mottled patterns and diffuse colors like modern birds, scientists at the University of Alberta, led by Ryan C. McKellar, said in a report published Thursday in the journal Science.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Dr. McKellar’s team said the amber pieces, though small, “provide novel insights regarding feather formation.” The preserved filaments “display a wide range of pigmentation from nearly transparent to dark,” but “no larger-scale patterns are apparent.” ||||| Summary:","output":"Amber, hardened tree resin, has allowed researchers to study ancient feathers from 70 million years ago, providing them with a new perspective on what some dinosaurs may have looked like. The preserved specimens offer various types of feathers, from simple to complex structures, which give insight into the evolution of these creatures. These discoveries reveal that dinosaurs had a more diverse array of feathers than initially believed. Researchers from the University of Alberta have analyzed the amber specimens found in western Canada, which contain simple filament structures similar to the earliest non-flying dinosaurs and more complicated bird feathers with pigmentation and adaptations for flight and diving. These findings, along with a separate report by Roy A. Wogelius of the University of Manchester, suggest that the colors of these ancient feathers included black, brown, and reddish-brown. The preserved pigment cells further indicate the possibility of mottled patterns and diffuse colors similar to modern birds. The specimens found entombed in 70-million-year-old amber represent distinct stages of feather evolution, from elementary protofeathers to more complex structures. These discoveries support the evolutionary model of feather development, shedding light on how the transition from simple hairs to modern feathers with multiple tiers of branching occurred."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press      Prime Minister Justin Trudeau formally apologized Wednesday for a shameful episode in Canada’s history, when this country turned away more than 900 German Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi terror and persecution.      Canada’s 1939 refusal to grant asylum to the refugees on the MS St. Louis ocean liner and its callous attitude to what was unfolding in Europe was not only a dereliction of moral duty but helped embolden Adolf Hitler as he set about murdering millions of Jewish people, Mr. Trudeau said.      “[Hitler] watched ... as we refused their visas, ignored their letters and denied them entry,” the Prime Minister told the House of Commons.      Story continues below advertisement      “There is little doubt that our silence permitted the Nazis to come up with their own final solution,\\" he said of the indifference and apathy shown by many countries toward the Jewish people at the time.      In May, 1939, the St. Louis left Germany with passengers, including more than 900 Jewish German citizens seeking sanctuary. These refugees were barred from disembarking at the ship’s first destination in Cuba and then denied entry into the United States and finally Canada because of the government’s discriminatory “none is too many” immigration policy toward Jewish people, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a summary of the events. The U.S. State Department made its own apology in 2012.      The Jewish passengers returned to Europe where many were later condemned to concentration camps, with 254 killed during the Holocaust.      “To harbour such hatred and indifference towards the refugees was to share in the moral responsibility for their deaths,” Mr. Trudeau said.      “We apologize to the 907 German Jews aboard the MS St. Louis, as well as their families,” the Prime Minister told the Commons.      “We also apologize to others who paid the price of our inaction – whom we doomed to the ultimate horror of the death camps.”      Jan Blumenstein, a survivor of Nazi concentration camps including Auschwitz, had a grandmother on the St. Louis – Regina Blumenstein – who ultimately died in the Holocaust. He was present for the apology.      Story continues below advertisement      Story continues below advertisement      “Finally, somebody came to their senses and realized this is [still] going on all the time,\\" he said of the speech, saying it was important in that it acknowledged anti-Semitism remains strong.      Canada’s refusal to accept the St. Louis passengers took place more than six months after the infamous Kristallnacht in November, 1938, when storm troopers and members of the Hitler Youth burned hundreds of synagogues, smashed thousands of shop windows and killed dozens of Jews. About 30,000 people were sent to concentration camps, the first large cohort of the millions who would be murdered.      Mr. Trudeau warned of an “alarming rate” of discrimination and violence against Jewish people today.      “According to the most recent figures, 17 per cent of all hate crimes in Canada target Jewish people – far higher per capita than any other group,” the Prime Minister said.      “Holocaust deniers still exist. Anti-Semitism is still far too present. Jewish institutions and neighbourhoods are still being vandalized with swastikas,” he said.      He cited the recent killing of 11 people and wounding of six others at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.      Story continues below advertisement      “We must guard our communities and institutions against the kinds of evils that took hold in the hearts of so many, more than 70 years ago, for they did not end with the war,\\" Mr. Trudeau said.      The Prime Minister also raised intimidation of Jewish students on some Canadian college and university campuses by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions [BDS] campaign against Israel that he said makes them feel “unwelcomed and uncomfortable.”      The Prime Minister said the “long overdue” apology to the passengers of the St. Louis cannot erase the pain suffered by these refugees or those murdered in the Holocaust or their descendants. He said, however, he hopes it helps those hearing the apology to heal.      “More than 70 years ago, Canada turned its back on you,” he said to Jewish people.      “But today, Canadians pledge, now and forever: never again.\\"      Andrew Scheer, the Conservative Leader of the Official Opposition, echoed this apology and warned of “a disturbing resurgence and even normalization of anti-Semitic rhetoric.\\" This hatred “was not eradicated with the defeat of the Nazis. It is, unfortunately and sadly, very much alive today,\\" he said.      Story continues below advertisement      Nimrod Barkan, Israel’s Ambassador to Canada, was on hand for Mr. Trudeau’s address and said he was grateful to the Prime Minister. “We are all encouraged not only by the apology but more so by the comments about the need to fight anti-Semitism today, to fight BDS and to make sure there is no hate for Jews allowed anywhere around the world, and certainly not in Canada.”      With a report from Richard Blackwell ||||| Mr. Trudeau’s apology came less than two weeks after a gunman opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers, and at a time when anti-Semitism is rising across North America. It was not lost on many that it was delivered the day after an American election campaign marked by refugee-bashing.      “The rhetoric we are hearing across the border is very similar to the rhetoric we heard in the 1930s — the vilification of the other, the vilification of the press. It’s really scary,” said Danny Gruner, who attended Wednesday’s apology with his mother, Ana Maria Gordon, the sole survivor of the St. Louis living in Canada today.      Ms. Gordon, who met with Mr. Trudeau privately, was surrounded by many of her great-grandchildren and grandchildren.      Last week, Mr. Trudeau apologized to a British Columbia First Nation for the government’s treachery in inviting six Tsilhqot’in chiefs to peace talks 150 years ago. Instead of talking, the government arrested them, put them on trial and hanged them.      He has also apologized to Omar Khadr, the only Canadian who was held at the United States military base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. He emotionally apologized to gay members of the army, the police and in public service who were persecuted — some even imprisoned — because of their sexual orientation.      And he tearfully said sorry to indigenous people in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, where for much of the 20th century indigenous children were torn from their families and compelled to attend boarding schools, where many were abused.      “You will not remove the guilt from the perpetrators of the horror,” Mr. Gruner said. “But at least you can come to terms with what the country was at the time, and try to understand where we are at this particular time and where we want to be.” ||||| The Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler tested the limits of Canada's humanity in the lead up to the Second World War and Canada's government failed that test \\"miserably,\\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today.      The prime minister made the remarks as part of the apology delivered in the House of Commons for the 1939 decision by the Canadian government to turn away a boatload of German Jews seeking refuge from the Nazis.      \\"In the years leading up to the war, Hitler tested the world's resolve. He noted carefully as country after country proved itself indifferent to the plight of Jewish refugees,\\" Trudeau said.      Your country failed you. And for that, we are sorry. - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau      \\"He watched on as we refused their visas, ignored their letters and denied them entry. With every decree, he challenged the political courage of our leaders and the empathy of those who elected them.      \\"With every pogrom, he tested the bounds of our humanity and the limits of our solidarity ... Adolf Hitler's test was one the Canadian government failed miserably.\\"      In 1939, the MS St. Louis left Germany carrying 907 Jewish passengers fleeing persecution by the Nazi regime. The ship was turned away from Cuba and the United States before a group of Canadians tried to convince Prime Minister King's government to let it dock in Halifax.      The Canadian government heeded the anti-Semitic sentiment abroad at the time by severely restricting Jewish immigration. From 1933 to 1945, only about 5,000 Jewish refugees were accepted because of Canada's discriminatory 'none is too many' immigration policy.      When Ottawa refused to let the MS St. Louis passengers disembark, the ship returned to Europe.      About half the passengers were taken in by the U.K., the Netherlands, France and Belgium. About 500 of them ended up back in Germany, where 254 were killed in concentration and internment camps.      'Their cries for help were left unanswered'      \\"The story of the St. Louis and its passengers is no isolated incident,\\" Trudeau added.      \\"The Government of Canada was indifferent to the suffering of Jews long before the St. Louis ever set sail for Halifax, and sadly, long after it had returned to Europe.\\"      The prime minister went on to say the passengers of the MS St. Louis would have made Canada stronger but \\"their cries for help were left unanswered, for Canada deemed them unworthy of a home, and undeserving of our help.\\"      Trudeau said that Hitler, alone, did not seal the fate of the passengers of the MS St. Louis or the Jewish populations of Europe because for Canada \\"To harbour such hatred and indifference towards the refugees was to share in the moral responsibility for their deaths.\\"      The prime minister said that while decades have passed since the decision to turn away the MS St. Louis, the guilt or shame of rejecting the asylum seekers on that ship remains.      'Aliens in their own land'      \\"Today, I rise in this House of Commons to issue a long overdue apology to the Jewish refugees Canada turned away,\\" Trudeau said.      \\"We apologize to the 907 German Jews aboard the MS.

We also apologize to others who paid the price of our inaction, whom we doomed to the ultimate horror of the death camps.      \\"We used our laws to mask our anti-Semitism, our antipathy, our resentment. We are sorry for the callousness of Canada's response. And we are sorry for not apologizing sooner.\\"      Trudeau also apologized for letting anti-Semitism take root in Canada and for the way Canadians Jews were \\"meant to feel like strangers in their own homes, aliens in their own land.      \\"Your country failed you. And for that, we are sorry.\\"      A persistent problem      Trudeau went on to note that anti-Semitism continues to be a problem today in Canada. He said 17 per cent of all hate crimes target Canadian Jews — meaning the Jewish community experiences a far higher per-capita rate of hate crimes than any other group in Canada.      \\"Discrimination and violence against Jewish people in Canada and around the world continues at an alarming rate,\\" he said.      \\"Less than two weeks ago, not too far from here, a gunman opened fire on worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing eleven people and wounding six others.\\"      Jewish passengers of the MS St. Louis, a refugee ship turned away from Canada in 1939, returned to Europe to face Nazi persecution and the Holocaust.

He pledged to do more to protect Jewish places of worship.      While the apology will not ease the pain for those who lost family members on the MS St. Louis, Trudeau said he hopes it will bring them some sense of peace.      \\"More than 70 years ago, Canada turned its back on you,\\" he said. \\"But today, Canadians pledge, now and forever — never again.\\"      Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer taking part in the Canadian government's official apology for the 1939 decision to turn away the MS St. Louis and its 907 German Jewish passengers fleeing the Nazi Regime. 10:43      \\"It is a sign of a healthy society to be able to look at history clearly and see both the light and the dark, to celebrate our achievements but to also mourn our failings,\\" Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said.      \\"There is no shame as a country in acknowledging shameful acts in our past. The real shame would be in forgetting them.\\"      Occasions like these help Canada strike a path for the future, the Conservative leader said, adding that Canadians should continue to stand up to acts of dehumanization that lead to atrocities.      \\"Canada should have offered sanctuary of the passengers of the MS St. Louis. For our failure to do so then we stand with the government today in its apology,\\" Scheer said. \\"Never again, must 'none be too many.'\\"      The NDP's Guy Caron taking part in the Canadian government's official apology for the 1939 decision to turn away the MS St. Louis and its 907 German Jewish passengers fleeing the Nazi Regime. 9:36      \\"Two hundred and fifty four people who had boarded the MS St. Louis in the hopes of fleeing death ... could have been saved had Canada said, \`Yes,\\" \`said NDP leader in the House of Commons Guy Caron. \\"Canada abandoned people who then became victims to Hitler and his hate.      \\"The passengers of the MS St. Louis were fleeing anti-Semitism, unaware that anti-Semitism had crossed the ocean before them.      \\"Intolerance has no place here, yesterday, today and tomorrow.\\"      The Bloc Quebecois' Mario Beaulieu also stood in the House to deliver comments in French before Green Party Leader Elizabeth May closed out the apology with her own statement.

Unable to dock in Canada, the US or Cuba, the passengers returned to Europe and faced Nazi persecution. Over 250 of them died in concentration camps. Warning of an “alarming rate” of anti-Semitism today, Trudeau drew parallels between the killings of 11 people in Pittsburgh last month and the historic treatment of Jews."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: what became the standard german term for the art song??","output":"The standard German term for the art song is \\"Lied\\" (plural: Lieder). The Lied is a musical genre that emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in what is now considered the Romantic era of classical music. Its development was inspired by the convergence of poetry and music, as well as a blossoming interest in the expression of individual emotions, personal experiences, and introspection. As a musical form, the Lied typically consists of a German poem set to music for solo voice, usually accompanied by a piano. In some cases, other instrumental accompaniments or small ensembles can be utilized. One of the key features of the Lied is its focus on the narrative or emotional content of the poem, with the music composed to reflect, enhance, and sometimes even transcend the textual meaning. The emergence of the Lied as a popular genre can be attributed to composers such as Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann, who were among the first to delve into this expressive musical form. Schubert, in particular, is considered the pioneer of the Lied, having composed over 600 songs in this style throughout his career. His most famous works in this genre include the song cycles \\"Die schöne Müllerin\\" and \\"Winterreise.\\" Subsequent composers, such as Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, and Richard Strauss, continued to develop and elevate the Lied to new artistic heights. These composers, along with their predecessors, skillfully explored the depth of human emotions, the beauty of nature, and the intricacies of personal relationships through their Lieder. Furthermore, they integrated diverse musical elements, such as advanced harmony, melody, rhythm, and form, to better serve the expressive requirements of the text. As the genre evolved, composers began to experiment with the thematic content and musical structure of the Lied to create more sophisticated and multi-layered pieces. Some Lieder became highly complex, with intricate piano accompaniments and virtuosic vocal lines, while others remained simple and intimate. This diversity and adaptability of the Lied as a genre allowed it to maintain its relevance throughout the Romantic period and beyond, as it continued to be explored by composers of various nationalities and stylistic tendencies. In conclusion, the standard German term for the art song is \\"Lied,\\" a genre that emerged in the Romantic era as a result of the blending of poetry and music. It has played a significant role in the evolution of classical music and continues to be an essential part of the solo vocal repertoire, thanks to the groundbreaking works by composers like Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, and Richard Strauss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The posts are \\"HISTORICAL\\" when the author has already done something and they are \\"HYPOTHETICAL\\" when the author is considering doing something in the future. Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Input: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Many years ago I was a drug addict. I ended up homeless, penniless and majorly depressed. My older sister, Jane, told me to figure my life out and hung up on me. My oldest sister, Ann, drove down to pick me up and she gave me a place to stay. I think she saved my life that day. I ended up staying with her rent free for 2 years. During that time she also helped me in my personal life, kept me away from my abusive ex and addicted friends, found me a full time job and straightened out my life. I owe her so much. I'm thankful for all she did for me and that she didn't give up on me that day. It's been a few years since I moved out but we're still very close now. ​ When Ann got married I threw myself into the wedding planning. I wanted to repay her kindness for me. I bought and decorated her wedding shoes, sewed her daughter's dress for the wedding, baked her wedding cake, cupcakes and eclairs for her guests. I also DIYed her centerpieces for the tables. I was very involved in her wedding. Now Jane is getting married and she expected me to be as involved in her wedding as I was with Ann, but I'm not. I'm tired from working and I just don't want to bake a cake and other desserts for 70+ guests again. I told her she could reuse the centerpieces for her wedding but she wants completely new ones even though I kept them in really good condition. When Jane found out that I'm not keen on baking or crafting new center pieces for her wedding she complained that I was being unfair and showing favoritism. She tried begging but I continued to decline and said the reason I helped Ann with her wedding so much was to repay her kindness during the time I was homeless. Now Jane thinks I'm punishing her because she didn't help me out when I was homeless. That's not true. We buried the hatchet and forgave each other a long time ago.

London (AFP) - British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen and his wife are donating 1 million (900,000 euros) to help Syrian refugees, the charities receiving the money announced Sunday.      The \\"Borat\\" star and actress wife Isla Fisher are giving 500,000 to Save the Children to pay for measles vaccinations for children in northern Syria.      They are also donating the same amount to the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to help refugees in Syria and neighbouring countries, particularly women and children, with health care, shelter and sanitation.      More than four million refugees have fled conflict in Syria for the relative safety of the neighbouring countries, according to the United Nations.      Millions more have been forced to leave their homes for other parts of the country.      Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said the money would \\"save many thousands of lives and protect some of the most vulnerable children\\".      \\"By allowing us to make their generous donation to Syrian children public, Sacha and Isla are helping highlight the tragedy of the issue today,\\" he added.      David Miliband, the ex-British foreign secretary who is president of the IRC, called their gift a \\"great expression of humanity.\\" ||||| Today Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher have made a 1 million donation split equally between Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee to support victims of the conflict in Syria.      Donate now to help us provide food, water, medicine and education to Syrian children.      Today Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher have made a 1 million donation split equally between Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee to support victims of the conflict in Syria.      500,000 Dollars will be used to fund a programme vaccinating more than 250,000 children against a potential measles outbreak in Northern Syria. The other half of the donation will be used to help fund the work to support families, with a special concern for women and children, both inside Syria and in neighbouring countries who are suffering as a result of the ongoing conflict. The money will go towards education, health care, shelter and sanitation.      There are currently four million refugees in neighbouring states and over seven million displaced inside Syria. It has been estimated that around 12,000 children have been killed in the conflict and the real number may be much higher. Some sources have indicated that thousands of children have been killed by barrel bombs alone.      Justin Forsyth, Save the Children CEO, said: “The Syrian conflict is now approaching its fifth year and children are the first victims. There is no safe place left in Syria, with shelling and violence omnipresent. Food and medicines have become scarce and basic necessities unaffordable. Syria’s health system has collapsed and deadly childhood diseases – like measles - which had previously been all but eradicated have now returned, threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. By allowing us to make their generous donation to Syrian children public, Sacha and Isla are helping highlight the tragedy of the issue today. These are desperate times for Syrian families facing bombs, bullets and torture in Syria. The couple’s donation will save many thousands of lives and protect some of the most vulnerable children.”      David Miliband, president and CEO of the international rescue committee (IRC) said: \\"Now is the time for all of us to double down on commitments to civilians caught up in the Syria conflict. These people are the victims of terror. As hope for the end of conflict recedes, it is all the more important to meet the most basic human needs.

Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: What is the setting of this story? Movie title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral. He begins tiring of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has... The answer is:","output":"The setting of the story in the movie \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" is primarily in Italy during the 1950s. The movie starts in New York City, where Tom Ripley gets the task to persuade Dickie Greenleaf to return to the United States.

We were there June 6, and around 830PM, we decided to walk in the Verona Restaurant, since we wanted a nice dinner for my husband's birthday. The hostess that sat us promptly was gracious, and said someone would be there shortly with water.  We waited about 5 minutes for water. Our waiter Peter must of been having an off night, or support staff wasn't there. I cannot think of too many reasons for how were treated during our meal there.  First of all, the ambiance of the restaurant is nice, the booths just a bit nicer with the nice leather seating. The ceiling has a nice alabaster light, but it seemed to be right on our table. Perhaps at a later hour they dim the lights? Before we were even acknowledged by Peter, our waiter, or anyone with a glass a water was probably a good 5-6 minutes after we sat down. At least get a person a glass of water.  When Peter came over, we had plenty of time to review the menus, as the hostess had given those when we first sat down. Peter ran through the menu, offered to get drinks. My husband decided on water, and I requested a cup of coffee with cream. We placed our order, hubby had the NY steak with the Potatoes Rustica, and I had the 8oz Ribeye with Baby Vegetables(broccalini).  The redeeming quality of this place WAS the food. I had to ask for my coffee again, I was just about done with dinner. We were NEVER EVEN ASKED ONCE HOW OUR FOOD WAS. NOT ONCE.  I am so disappointed in this place. I thought we might of found a nice, dress up nice and have a celebration dinner, as my husband wanted a casino night for his birthday. It seemed our bread came late... while the rolls are good, you get a couple, I hesitated to even think of asking for any more.  Our water glasses were never refilled(glasses completely OUT of water), wait-staff never asked how things went with us.... ANYTHING to acknowledge that we were even there. I believe it was the manager that refilled our glasses about 5 minutes before we left.  Perhaps we weren't high-rollers? I don't know the answer to that one. I do know that the party next to us, had a wonderful waitress, and she communicated with them. We never asked for anything out of the ordinary, we were dressed appropriately for a nice restaurant, and we have dined in nice places before, and never been treated so poorly.  We never demanded anything, didn't order something not on the menu, we weren't demanding in any way shape or form.    WAIT! We asked for bread after the salad arrived, maybe that was it?? We had been there around 30-35 minutes when we requested bread..We almost had consumed the salad and from experience, you usually will get a selection of bread. Although, once the bread arrived, Stephen did an awesome job preparing the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was good.  I think that perhaps they realized that things were basically not salvageable, as Peter said when he dropped off the dinner check, and hurried off, \\"the coffee is free\\" said as he passed by the table. Weird.  I wouldn't go back to the restaurant. I had hoped for a place where you are treated well, and the food good.  I have to say that the prices, I thought we reasonable, my 8OZ  Ribeye was 17, with one side included. We ordered an In Casa Ensalta(sp) - 8- which was pretty good.   The food isn't the problem, at least not on June 6, 2009, it was either the staffing wasn't sufficent - it should've of been... It was Saturday night. They should expect more diners on a weekend night, and staff accordingly. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","output":"This review can be described as having mixed sentiment. The reviewer gives the restaurant two stars and expresses a mostly negative sentiment towards the service they experienced from their waiter, Peter, and the overall dining experience. They mention long waiting times for water and bread, insufficient attention from the staff, and lack of communication on how their meal was. Additionally, they express disappointment in not being treated well, possibly due to not being perceived as high-rollers. However, the sentiment shifts to positive when discussing the food, which the reviewer considers as the redeeming quality of the restaurant, and they find the prices reasonable. They compliment the dishes they ordered, namely the NY steak, Potatoes Rustica, Ribeye, Baby Vegetables, and In Casa Ensalata.  In summary, the sentiment of the review is mixed, with positive sentiment about the food, ambiance, and pricing, but negative sentiment about the service and overall experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He offers D 500,000 as a down payment, and offers him 10mil if he carries out the job. D has Elbourne double the payment, and agrees to search for Charlotte. At the same time, Charlotte's older brother hires another group of vampire hunters, the notorious Marcus brothers, composed of the leader Borgoff, a hulking man named Nolt, a blade master named Kyle, a physically disabled psychic named Grove and a woman named Leila who hunts vampires because of a personal grudge rather than for monetary gain. The two parties (D and the Marcus brothers) race inexorably after Meier Link. However, Meier Link hires the mutant Barbarois; a group of lethal mercenary body guards.

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff. After the end of the story, the narrator is probably feeling Pick the correct answer from the following options: - A little better - Blue - not enough information - Still watching autopsies Answer:","output":"A little better"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Output:","output":"72 To solve this problem, we can break it down into a few steps using the definition of the problem.  1. We know Isabel bought 4 country albums and 5 pop albums, so to find the total number of albums she bought, we add the two numbers: 4 (country albums) + 5 (pop albums) = 9 (total albums). 2. Since each album has 8 songs, we can find the total number of songs by multiplying the number of albums by the number of songs per album: 9 (total albums) * 8 (songs per album) = 72 (total songs).

Context: Englishman Sir Francis Drake probably located the island on the final leg of his circumnavigation of the world (1577–1580). Further visits by other English explorers followed, and, once Saint Helena’s location was more widely known, English ships of war began to lie in wait in the area to attack Portuguese India carracks on their way home. In developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island. The Portuguese and Spanish soon gave up regularly calling at the island, partly because they used ports along the West African coast, but also because of attacks on their shipping, the desecration of their chapel and religious icons, destruction of their livestock and destruction of plantations by Dutch and English sailors.","output":"The two nations that did NOT give up calling on Saint Helena were the Dutch and English.

So, their individual work rates are: a's work rate = 1/28 (work/day) b's work rate = 1/10 (work/day) Step 2: Calculate the work done by b in 5 days b works for 5 days, so we'll multiply b's work rate by 5 to get the work done.
