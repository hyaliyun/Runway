The soldiers include a lieutenant who likes art, a macho sergeant, a farmer accompanied by his beloved donkey Silvana, and other quirky people. They are not very good soldiers, but a cross section of average, independent men.The soldiers anticipate attack from outside and on the island and take all sorts of inept precautions. They find a small town with no people. They see bombing on the horizon and realize that the ship that would pick them up has been destroyed. Then mysteriously, people reappear in the village: the villagers say they hid because the Germans had taken all the men. They have decided to accommodate the Italians. It isn't long before everyone's sunny nature appears. The Italian soldiers are absorbed into the life, heat and landscape of the idyllic island.The local priest asks the lieutenant, a Sunday painter, to restore the murals in his church. Two soldiers, who are brothers, befriend a lovely young woman, a shepherdess, who believes that three is the perfect number for an affair of pure sexual fun.

Paul Scholes has claimed that former Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney may be past his best and says England must show the strength to drop him if he performs poorly at another World Cup. The Old Trafford legend believes that Rooney, 28, must live up to expectations in Brazil if he wants to be considered as one of the world’s top players after failing to score in the last two tournaments in Germany and South Africa. Scholes, who was on United’s coaching staff for the final four games of the season, also claimed that Rooney does not work as well in a strike partnership and that could mean Louis van Gaal has to choose between him and Robin van Persie next season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney in England training. Reached his peak? Paul Scholes (left) fears former United team-mate Wayne Rooney may be past his best. ‘After an. indifferent season, the England management team has to get the best from. Wayne Rooney for the World Cup,’ said Scholes. ‘He’s. got a brilliant scoring record for his country with 38 goals in 89. internationals, but he’s played in eight World Cup games without a goal. You expect more of him. If Wayne is going to be one of the best. footballers in the world, this World Cup is where he has to produce. ‘Maybe. Wayne has felt the  pressure of playing for England in the last two. World Cups when he’s not scored. I know how difficult it can be. Wayne’s. peak may have been a lot younger than we’d expect of footballers. traditionally. ‘Age. 28 or 29 has been the normal peak. With Wayne, it could have been when. he scored 27 league goals in 2011-2012 when he was 26. ‘Wayne. was in the Everton team at 16 years of age, in 2003. Since then he’s. played at Euro 2004, two World Cups, the Premier League, and Champions. League every year. There’s a chance he’s worn out. Remember the name: Rooney (left) made his debut for boyhood club Everton at the age of 16 in 2002. ‘I’m. not saying Wayne needs to be dropped, but if his form doesn’t get up to. scratch in the warm-ups, or in the first game of the World Cup, it will. be interesting to see if the  England management team has the balls to. make that decision. ‘We. have quality forwards in the squad this time. That should give Wayne. the competition he needs to spur him on a little more.’ Scholes believes Rooney needs to conserve his energy and focus on scoring goals if he is going to be most effective in Brazil. Coaches: Scholes was part of the United interim management team with Phil Neville and Nicky Butt. He. added: ‘To get the very best from Wayne, the manager needs to tell him,. “Don’t bother running back. Stay up top. Stay centre  forward. Score. goals. That’s your job in my team”. ‘Wayne’s. almost like a schoolkid. He loves being a footballer. Wayne wants all. the responsibility to score. He’ll try to play left back, right back. Sometimes he does that too much instead of saving himself and his energy. for what his teams need — the ball in the net. He needs to use his. energy more effectively now as he’s a player who likes to be up front on. his own and I don’t think he’s great with partnerships. ‘It’ll. be interesting next season with Louis van Gaal and how he decides to. play Wayne. It looks like it might come to a straight choice between. Wayne and Van Persie.’ Tucked away: Rooney (left) scored 17 league goals this season for United as the club finished seventh. In. his blog for Paddy Power, Scholes also admitted he is unlikely to be. involved in Van Gaal’s backroom team, and warned United executive. vice-chairman Ed Woodward he still needs to convince people that he is. good enough for the job. He. added: ‘I’ve not spoken to Edward Woodward. I’m not waiting for a phone. call and don’t expect to be at Old Trafford next season. ‘Louis. van Gaal has the credentials but he has a major job on his hands. United need five or six  players to get anywhere near the top of the. Premier League again. Straight to the point: Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal (left) speaks with Robin van Persie on Thursday. ‘The. players did not perform last season. It was a disaster. David Moyes was. a little negative with the teams he put out and he took a lot of stick,. but I believe he’s a top manager. I’d question if 10 months was enough. time. ‘Edward. Woodward has an awful lot to prove this time that he’s good enough at. his job. He has to bring the players in that the new manager wants. It’s. obvious that last year he didn’t manage to do that. ‘If he doesn’t, we are not going to get anywhere near the top.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"In this article, Paul Scholes expresses his concerns about former Manchester United teammate, Wayne Rooney, potentially being past his best and the possibility of him under-performing during the World Cup.

(I) yes. (II) it is not possible to tell. (III) no.","output":"(II) It is not possible to tell. Based on the provided premise, which states that \\"Other critics say the play has outlived [its] raciness\\" and mentions that La Ronde was banned at the turn of the century, we cannot definitively conclude whether the hypothesis that \\"Kidman only agreed to appear in the play on the basis that the movie would later be banned and generate publicity for her\\" is true. There are several reasons why we cannot draw a clear conclusion about Kidman's motivations for appearing in the play: 1. Lack of Information about Kidman's Motivations: The premise does not provide any direct information about Kidman's thoughts or motivations behind her decision to appear in the play. We can only speculate on her intentions based on the play's content and history. 2. Outdated Raciness: While La Ronde was initially banned due to its raciness at the time, the premise indicates that the play's content is now considered relatively tame. This could suggest that Kidman's decision to be a part of the play may not be rooted in the desire to generate publicity through controversy, but rather in the artistic elements of the play or other professional reasons. 3. Multiple Characters and Co-Star: The premise mentions that Kidman and her co-star, Iain Glen, both played various characters in the play. This could be interpreted as an indication that the play's structure and acting challenges might have been an appealing aspect for both actors rather than the play's potentially controversial nature. 4. No Mention of Movie Adaptation: The hypothesis specifically states that Kidman agreed to appear in the play with the expectation of generating publicity for \\"the movie.\\" However, the premise does not mention anything about a movie adaptation of the play. This makes it difficult to determine whether the hypothesis is true or false, as the link between the play and a movie adaptation is unclear. Considering all these points, it is not possible to tell whether the hypothesis is true or not. The provided premise does not offer enough information about Kidman's motivations or the potential existence of a movie adaptation to support or refute the hypothesis. Furthermore, the premise suggests that La Ronde's content may no longer be as controversial as it once was, which could imply that any potential publicity generated by a modern performance of the play may not be rooted in controversy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremonies Live Coverage THE GAMES ARE UNDERWAY (12:40 BST/7:40 ET) \\"The moment everyone was waiting for finally arrived. The Olympic torch, which spent 70 days traveling across the United Kingdom, carried by 8,000 torchbearers from all walks of life, made its way into the stadium. The torchbearer's identity had been a well-kept secret. The two most popular suggestions were Roger Bannister, who broke the 4-minute barrier in the mile in 1954, and Steve Redgrave, a five-time Olympic champion in rowing. The other great secret was how it would be done, and where it would be located. In the stadium, a video showed David Beckham zipping up the Thames in speedboat with the torch. When the boat reached the dock, Beckham then passed it Redgrave, who made the final run to the stadium. The torch made its way toward the flags of the 204 competing nations carried by group of seven young athletes. There would be no big-name former athlete as torchbearer after all. A ring of flames rose in the center of the stadium creating a cauldron, marking the official start of the London Olympics. The stadium exploded. Fireworks filled the sky.

Context: There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.

In 1935, murderer Mattie Appleyard (James Stewart), bank robber Lee Cottrill (Strother Martin), and young Johnny Jesus (Kurt Russell) are released from the West Virginia State Penitentiary, located in the fictional town of Glory. Appleyard is issued a check for 25,452.32 for his 40 years of prison work, an enormous amount in the Great Depression.All three men are escorted by prison Captain \\"Doc\\" Council (George Kennedy) to the train station, ensuring they leave town. However once on the train, Appleyard realizes that his check is only redeemable in person at the local bank in Glory, requiring his return. In the meantime, Council is in league with banker Homer Grindstaff (David Huddleston) to ensure Appleyard will not cash the check. He and his accomplices, Steve Mystic (Mike Kellin) and Junior Kilfong (Morgan Paull), travel to another stop down the line in order to kill Appleyard. Informed of the plot by guilt-ridden conductor Willis Hubbard (Robert Donner), the three former prisoners thwart the plan. Kilfong ends up shooting an innocent passenger, mining supply salesman Roy K. Sizemore (William Windom). Council kills the wounded Sizemore and places the blame on Appleyard, who escapes with Sizemore's supply of dynamite.The next day, Council informs Grindstaff of the previous events at the bank. As they talk, Appleyard walks in with dynamite strapped to his chest and a suitcase with the remainder, \\"60 more pounds.\\" Appleyard threatens to blow them all up \\"and half this city block\\" if the banker doesn't cash his check. Grindstaff reluctantly complies.Appleyard and his friends, who followed him back to Glory, split up with the plan to meet again later. While waiting at the rendezvous, Cottrill is talked into boarding a houseboat owned by a down-on-her-luck prostitute named Cleo (Anne Baxter) for a drink of whiskey. Also aboard is Chanty (Katherine Cannon), a sixteen-year-old virgin whom Cleo has taken in, hoping to receive 100 from any customer in exchange for her virginity.Appleyard and Johnny show up, only to be tracked down by Council and his bloodhound. The three friends get away in a skiff, leaving the suitcase of dynamite with Cleo. Johnny is worried about what Council will do to Chanty, so they turn around and go back after Council leaves.Before Council left, he told Cleo about Appleyard's money. Held at gunpoint, Appleyard gives her the suitcase that she believes contains the money in exchange for Chanty. After they leave, Cleo tries to shoot the locked suitcase open with disastrously fatal, yet comedic results.The fugitives are later trapped on a boxcar by Council. The train is a \\"fools' parade\\" as described by Appleyard, going nowhere beyond the local train yard. Luckily for them, guilt-ridden train conductor Willis Hubbard returns and helps them escape. However, he is too afraid of Council to tell the police what he knows.Council, Mystic, and Kilfong (Morgan Paull) track them to an abandoned house. Council decides he doesn't want to share the loot, so he kills his two confederates. He then shoots a window out, wounding Appleyard. Johnny throws a stick of the remaining dynamite at Council, but Council's bloodhound comically returns it. Appleyard hastily throws it back out the window, killing Council.The men are arrested and Appleyard's money confiscated, but Hubbard has mustered up enough courage to confess the truth.

Tom Stansfield is a researcher at a publishing company who works under the tyrannical Jack Taylor. Tom has a crush on his boss' daughter, Lisa, who is completely controlled by her overprotective father. She reveals to Tom that her father is making her house-sit the same night as a party she wants to attend, but Tom convinces her to stand up to her father and attend the party anyway. Lisa asks him to come to their house that night, leading Tom to think that she has invited him to the party; in reality, she just wants him to fill in for her - he reluctantly agrees. A comedy of errors ensues, including the return of Lisa's older brother, Red, on the run from drug dealers. Red dumps drugs into the toilet, and instead returns a bag of flour to the drug dealer. One of Tom's tasks is to guard their owl, O-J, which lives in an open cage (it has not been able to fly due to a deep depression, from the loss of a prior mate).

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: On a grassy plain in South Africa,thousands of miles from home,two pairs of Zoo--bred South China tiger cubs----one-year-o1d Hope and Cathay and six-month-old Tiger Woods and Madonna--are learning to hunt in the wild.The hope is that they will one day pass on their skills to their young,allowing the next generation to get back to wildlife reserves in China. A survey shows that the tigers are in more danger of dying out than China's most famous animal,the giant panda.Forty years ago,about 4,000 South China tigers lived in the wild.Today there are only about 30.An additional 64 live in 19 zoos in China,,which are all descendants of six wild animals seized in 1956. The cubs were born in zoos in China and removed from their mothers when they were three months old.Their first home in South Africa was a one-acre camp where they stayed for a month.Their next home was a ten acre area,where they lived for three months to help them gradually get used to life outside a cage. When the cubs first arrived in South Africa,they didn't even want to leave their cages.It took weeks to get them to eat chicken,used as they were to being fed beef at the Zoo in China where they were born.It took months of practice to hunt a live animal and then make the link between the kill and food.Now just a few months on,and living in a 150-acre camp,they have become remarkably skilled hunters. All four animals will finally return to Zoos in China while the pioneering pairs' cubs will grow up completely wild.The aim is for _ to go to reserves developed in China by 2008,when the Olympic Games will be held in Beijing. Question: Which of the following is true? Answer: Answer:","output":"The South China tiger cubs, which include one-year-old Hope and Cathay and six-month-old Tiger Woods and Madonna, were zoo-bred and brought to South Africa to learn hunting skills in the wild, with the objective of eventually passing on these skills to their offspring.

At night, Jody appears to Reggie in a dream and takes him to the Tall Man's lair, where they rescue Mike. As Reggie wakes, Jody opens a portal and Mike emerges. The Tall Man tries to follow, but Reggie closes the portal, leaving the Tall Man's hands behind. After fighting off the Tall Man's minions, including the undead looters, they enter a large mortuary.... Answer:","output":"In the movie Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead, the Tall Man dislikes opposition and individuals who interfere with his plans. Throughout the movie, he shows disdain for the main protagonists, Reggie, Mike, and their allies, who continuously challenge his attempts to spread death and destruction. The Tall Man also dislikes defeat, as evidenced by his relentless pursuit of the main characters and his refusal to give up even when faced with obstacles. Another aspect that the Tall Man might dislike is the human resistance and their ability to fight back against his evil actions. This can be seen through the various confrontations between the Tall Man and the main characters, as well as their ability to rescue Mike and thwart his plans. In summary, the Tall Man in Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead dislikes opposition, defeat, and human resistance, as these factors directly challenge his reign of terror and his plans to conquer the world of the living."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Unfortunately the print for this DVD is very poor. Most images are washed out to the point identifying the different actors can be difficult at times. In fact it finally got the best of me, and I did not finish watching it. Old serials like these from the non-surviving studios must be rare and good prints even rarer. It is doubtful it would be economically viable to restore this one or others like it.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door.

ANXIOUS TIMES--A SEARCH ORGANISED AND VIGOROUSLY CARRIED OUT.  It is not easy to conceive the state of alarm that prevailed in the settlement of the Norsemen when it came to be known that little Snorro and Olaf were lost. The terrible fact did not of course break on them all at once.  For some hours after the two adventurers had left home, Dame Gudrid went briskly about her household avocations, humming tunefully one of her native Icelandic airs, and thinking, no doubt, of Snorro. Astrid, assisted by Bertha, went about the dairy operations, gossiping of small matters in a pleasant way, and, among other things, providing Snorro's allowance of milk. Thora busied herself in the preparation of Snorro's little bed; and Freydissa, whose stern nature was always softened by the sight of the child, constructed, with elaborate care, a little coat for Snorro's body. Thus Snorro's interests were being tenderly cared for until the gradual descent of the sun induced the remark, that \\"Olaf must surely have taken a longer walk than usual that day.\\"  \\"I must go and meet them,\\" said Gudrid, becoming for the first time uneasy.  \\"Let me go with you,\\" said Bertha.  \\"Come, child,\\" returned Gudrid.

As a result, prince Al-Mu'tamin flees to Castile to warn king Ferdinand of Yusufs invasion. In Castile, Rodrigo de Vivar is living a life of privilege as the son of a nobleman. He is best friends with prince Sancho and is secretly in a romantic relationship with Jimena, the daughter of count Gormaz. Unfortunately, Gormaz disapproves, and suggests that Jimena should marry the arrogant and self-centered count OrdoÃ±ez. As the royal court receives word that the Almoravids of Zaragoza had crossed the Castilian border, Rodrigo gets the opportunity to accompany Sancho, OrdoÃ±es and Gormaz on a scouting mission. Once they set up camp, Gormaz is ambushed by Al-Mu'tamin and his warriors, but Rodrigo intervenes. Once Al-Mu'tamin gets the chance to speak, he is allowed by Sancho to accompany them back to the palace. Some time later, king Ferdinand dies, and the devious and power-hungry princess Urraca plots to have Sancho killed so that the weak-minded prince Alfonso can be crowned. Gormaz meets with Rodrigo on a balcony, on Jimenas request, where Rodrigo asks for her hand in marriage. Gormaz refuses, and instead challenges Rodrigo to a swordfight. Rodrigo is hesitant to fight, but when Gormaz insists, he draws his sword. As the two fight, Urraca sends out her lover and servant to assassinate Sancho by stabbing him in the back with a dagger. At the same time, Rodrigo accidentally kills Gormaz. When Jimena witnesses, she vows to never speak to Rodrigo ever again, and he is forced to flee the scene.

You may have read some of the scary research recently that links parabens (a preservative ingredient found in loads of health and beauty products) with breast cancer, and whilst there is no evidence yet to prove that using parabens causes breast cancer more and more people are choosing to ditch parabens in favour of something more natural. I’m gradually trying to replace all of my old skincare and bodycare products with natural alternatives so that my body comes into contact with less parabens and other nasty chemicals. One of the types of products which seems to be very late to the natural table is deodorant, there isn’t a wide variety of paraben-free products available yet but I was really pleased to see that Soft & Gentle, a well-known household brand, had brought out this new 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant. It’s free from parabens, allergens and aluminium and uses astringent plant extracts that shrink the sweat pores to reduce perspiration whilst natural herb sage acts as a deodoriser. Available in three fragrances – Active, Floral and Care – I’ve been using the Floral Soft & Gentle 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant for over 2 weeks and I’ve really put it through its paces as the temperature has been fairly hot and humid for the last fortnight. With a deodorant there are 2 main factors that we can look at to evaluate its success – dryness and odour control. So how did this paraben free Soft & Gentle deodorant fare? With regard to dryness I found that it kept me dry all day. I’ve been walking 2 miles or more most days and the weather has been warm, over 25 degrees some days, and I’ve been feeling generally a bit hot and sticky. But not on my underarms, they’ve been dry and I feel confident that this deodorant controls my sweat. In the first couple of days I did notice a little bit of unpleasant odour, but then I increased the amount that I was spraying under each arm and after this I’ve experienced no problems whatsoever, even after doing exercise or going on a long walk.

If In the Victorian era, the town expanded northward from its original site (a Roman settlement at Waterhead); the commercial center now lies approximately 1 km (1.2 mile) from the lake., can we conclude that \\"The geographical position was an important influence of town's expansion.\\"?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that the geographical position was an important influence on the town's expansion during the Victorian era. The town's expansion northwards from its original position demonstrates how geography can significantly impact urban growth and development patterns. This observation is supported by various reasons explained in more detail below. 1. Resource Availability: The original site of settlement, a Roman settlement at Waterhead, may have had limited resources to support a growing population, prompting a move to the region northwards. If in this area resources such as fertile soil, fresh water, mineral resources, or timber were more plentiful, these could have attracted the population towards the north, thus influencing expansion in this direction. 2. Topography: The geographical layout of the land also plays a critical role in determining the direction of a town's growth. If the area towards the south was characterized by harsh topography such as steep mountains, vast deserts, or extensive marshlands, it would have naturally hindered development in that direction. In contrast, if the land to the north was flat and easier to build on, it would encourage expansion in that direction.  3. Climate: The weather patterns in the northward direction might have been more favorable for human habitation and agriculture. Climatic conditions influence development through their impact on health, productivity, and the economy, among other factors.  4. Trade and Commerce: If the town's commercial center now lies approximately 1 km from the lake, one might also consider the lake's influence on the trade and commerce during the Victorian era. Lakes were, and still are, significant sources of fish, and they also served as transport routes. Being close to a water body would have facilitated trade and commerce, thereby encouraging population growth and urban expansion in that direction. 5. Infrastructure Development: During the Victorian era, advancements in technology and infrastructure such as railroads, roads, and bridges may have made it easier for the town to expand northwards. Highways, streets, and railways often guide the direction of a town’s growth, as areas with better connectivity tend to develop faster. 6. Defence Mechanisms: Historically, elements like the proximity to water bodies were strategic for defense purposes, and towns close to these natural features were, in many cases, easier to protect. The position of the town 1 km away from the lake might have been planned because of strategic importance in ancient warfare.  Therefore, based on these reasons, we can say that the geographical position was an essential factor influencing the town’s northward expansion during the Victorian era. Geographical elements often dictate the ways in which human settlements grow and evolve over time, shaping our living environments to a large extent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life?  Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. A:","output":"Aspen is the city that didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life. The paragraph states that there was no air pollution in Aspen, while Seattle experienced a lot of air pollution.

Answer the question...how old is megan prince harry's wife??","output":"Megan, more commonly spelled as Meghan, refers to Meghan Markle, who is Prince Harry's wife. Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981. To determine her age, we would need to calculate the difference between her birth year and the current year, taking into account her birth month and day. As of October 2021, Meghan Markle is 40 years old. She turned 40 on August 4, 2021. This age may change depending on the current date. To determine her current age in the future, follow these steps: 1. Take note of the current year. For example, if it is the year 2023, we will use this year in our calculation. 2. Subtract Meghan's birth year (1981) from the current year. In our example, we would calculate 2023 - 1981 = 42. 3. Consider the month and day of her birthday. Meghan's birthday is on August 4. Compare her birthday to the current date. If her birthday has already occurred in the current year, you can use the result from step 2 as her age. However, if the current date is before her birthday, subtract one from the result in step 2. In our example, if the current date in 2023 is before August 4, Meghan would be 41 years old.

The two sides of Istanbul's metro are connected under the Bosphorus by the Marmaray tunnel, inaugurated in 2013 as the first rail connection between Thrace and Anatolia. Until then, buses provide transportation within and between the two halves of the city, accommodating 2.2 million passenger trips each day. The Metrobus, a form of bus rapid transit, crosses the Bosphorus Bridge, with dedicated lanes leading to its termini. İDO (Istanbul Seabuses) runs a combination of all-passenger ferries and car-and-passenger ferries to ports on both sides of the Bosphorus, as far north as the Black Sea. With additional destinations around the Sea of Marmara, İDO runs the largest municipal ferry operation in the world. The city's main cruise ship terminal is the Port of Istanbul in Karaköy, with a capacity of 10,000 passengers per hour. Most visitors enter Istanbul by air, but about half a million foreign tourists enter the city by sea each year. International rail service from Istanbul launched in 1889, with a line between Bucharest and Istanbul's Sirkeci Terminal, which ultimately became famous as the eastern terminus of the Orient Express from Paris. Regular service to Bucharest and Thessaloniki continued until the early 2010s, when the former was interrupted for Marmaray construction and the latter was halted due to economic problems in Greece.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B.

It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls. In 2010, the Manchester Local Education Authority was ranked last out of Greater Manchester's ten LEAs – and 147th out...","output":"To answer the question, I will find the relevant information about the place whose previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music.

Martin's characters are wonderfully three dimensional, with actions that are driven by their own individual personalities rather than by a contrived plot. Full of surprises, deceptions, and multiple levels of betrayal, this one and its predecessor are books that will stay in the reader's mind long after the last page is turned. Because of the intricate plotting and mulitple storylines, this book is best read after you have reread A Game of Thrones.For those who don't know, the series is scheduled for a total of 6 books. There is supposed to be a five or so year break in \\"story\\" time after the third book, so the entire tale can be viewed as two related trilogies. This structure should help prevent the plot creep that has affected Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is quite positive. The reviewer expresses deep satisfaction and enthusiasm for the fantasy book mentioned, making a point to praise its realistic and intricate plot, full and well-constructed characters, and embedded surprises and deceptions. They obviously appreciate the adult theme of the novel, and that it breaks away from conventional contrived plots often intended for younger audiences. The reviewer lauds the author's ability to create a story that is endemic to the characters' personalities, showing an appreciation for good characterization and narrative depth. They also highly appreciate the narrative structure, expecting that the plan of releasing the full story in two related trilogies will help to avoid \\"plot creep\\", a storytelling flaw that they attribute to another series - Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. This shows that the reviewer is well-read and discerning, and brings up other fantasy series for comparison in a very considered, deliberate way, reinforcing the overall positive tone of the review. The use of words such as 'fantastic', 'finally', 'wonderfully', 'surprises', and 'intricately' further indicate a strong positive sentiment towards the series. The reviewer also reveals their long-term engagement with the series, recommending that a prior book be re-read to fully enjoy the complexity of the plot, and anticipates the future instalments with interest. They refer to the book as one that 'will stay in the reader's mind long after the last page is turned,' indicating that they found the book to be impactful and thought-provoking.

Fact 2: All plants are of bush type.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what detects and responds to the daily cycle of light and darkness?\\" with the following options:  - fens  - apples  - oxygen  - Oak  - gravity  - amoeba  - earth's rotation  - bushes Answer:","output":"Based on the given facts, the correct answer to the question \\"what detects and responds to the daily cycle of light and darkness?\\" is \\"bushes\\". Fact 1 indicates that plants detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness, and Fact 2 states that all plants are of bush type. Therefore, bushes detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's consider the process involved in plants detecting light and their ability to respond accordingly: Plants have specific photoreceptor proteins that help them sense light. These photoreceptors absorb different colors of light and transmit signals that allow the plant to adjust its growth and development based on various environmental factors. One of the most important processes impacted by the daily cycle of light and darkness is the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, including bushes, utilize sunlight to produce energy and synthesize food from water and carbon dioxide. The daily cycle of light and darkness directly influences the rate of photosynthesis, and as a result, impacts the plant's growth, reproduction, and other adaptative mechanisms such as opening and closing of stomata. Now, evaluating the given options, we can deduce why bushes are the best answer: - Fens: Fens are wetlands, which are ecosystems, not a type of organism. Therefore, they cannot detect or respond to the light cycle. - Apples: Although apples come from an apple tree, which is a plant that responds to the light cycle, an apple is a fruit and does not have its own mechanisms to detect and respond to light. - Oxygen: Oxygen is an element and a product of photosynthesis but is not able to detect or respond to the light cycle. - Oak: Oak is a type of tree, which could be considered a plant, but given the second fact where it is stated that all plants are of bush type, it is better to choose the more generic term \\"bushes\\" as the answer. - Gravity: Gravity is a fundamental force in nature and directly influences plants' growth and orientation. However, it does not detect and respond to the light and darkness cycle. - Amoeba: Amoeba is a kind of single-celled organism that lives in aquatic environments. Although some species might be photosynthetic, they are not plants and do not fit the provided facts. - Earth's rotation: Earth's rotation contributes to the daily cycle of light and darkness, but it is not an entity that detects and responds to it. In conclusion, the best answer considering the facts provided is that bushes detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After being fired from his post, Mays is surprisingly chosen as the party candidate for the presidency (after his party's original presidential and vice-presidential nominees die in a plane crash; their two separate planes crashed into each other) to run against sitting vice-president Brian Lewis. Assuming the election was already lost, the party decided to pick a likeable but losing minority candidate to improve their chances of another politician taking the office in the next presidential election. At first, Mays feels he will not be able to succeed as President because he would be representing the entire African-American populace, and does not want to do anything to mess it up. However, Mays begins to rise in the polls after his brother (Bernie Mac) persuades him to speak out for what he believes. He begins to talk about issues such as welfare, money, society, etc. After Lewis runs a series of attack ads including one saying Mays supports Cancer, Mays begins to fight back using what he claimed was \\"kissing\\" his opponent (Taking from Bugs Bunny-Elmer Fudd cartoons). In this strategy, Mays hires various individuals such as a KKK member to endorse his opponent, or dubs a videotape of Osama bin Ladin saying he hates America but likes Brian Lewis.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  With the ending of the Gupta Dynasty in northern India in the early 6th century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of Tamilakam) interfaced between the increasing use of the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. The local language formed the desi (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more marga (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (ghatikas) taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries.Contemporaneous literature and inscriptions show that Kannada was not only popular in the modern Karnataka region but had spread further north into present day southern Maharashtra and to the northern Deccan by the 8th century. Kavirajamarga, the work on poetics, refers to the entire region between the Kaveri River and the Godavari River as \\"Kannada country\\". Higher education in Sanskrit included the subjects of Veda, Vyakarana (grammar), Jyotisha (astronomy and astrology), Sahitya (literature), Mimansa (Exegesis), Dharmashastra (law), Puranas (ritual), and Nyaya (logic). An examination of inscriptions from this period shows that the Kavya (classical) style of writing was popular. The awareness of the merits and defects in inscriptions by the archivists indicates that even they, though mediocre poets, had studied standard classical literature in Sanskrit. An...

Context: Countess Nicolette de Gobignon pressed a wet cloth tothe King's brow. Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" Question: Nicolette thought the Kings family was Answer: Answer:","output":"Nicolette thought the King's family was more concerned with their own welfare than the King's well-being.

The fact that they crowded into the room, making it even more stifling, further suggests that they were more considered with their personal status and public appearance than the King's comfort. Nicolette's thoughts on this matter heighten the sense of inadequacy in the royal family's handling of the King's illness and also highlight her own dedication to the King's care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.

A pair of German officers abruptly interrupt their lunch to catch up with the rapidly descending plane. When the Germans arrive at the crash site, they encounter a burning fuselage surrounded by Italian soldiers. The soldiers explain that the pilot was killed in the crash. Satisfied, the Germans leave. As soon as they are gone, the Italians mock their imperious occupiers and part ranks to reveal a hidden and slightly injured American flyer, Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra).Ryan is taken to an Italian POW camp filled with British and American prisoners. Italian discipline over the camp is lax and the prisoners are filthy and ragged. Constant escape attempts have enraged the Italian commandant and resulted in the withholding of clean clothes, hot water, razors, and food parcels. The ranking British officer has just died while imprisoned in the camp sweat box. Command has fallen to the irascible British Major Fincham (Trevor Howard) of the Ninth Fusiliers.

Lawyer: Russia Becoming Anti-Democratic (AP) AP - A defense lawyer for jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky said Tuesday anti-democratic trends were emerging in Russia under President Vladimir Putin with the aim of quieting political opponents. What is this text about?","output":"This text is a brief news report discussing the concerns of a defense lawyer representing jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The lawyer claims that anti-democratic trends are emerging in Russia under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, with the intention of silencing political opponents. The news report indicates that the defense lawyer is worried about the state of democracy in Russia, and believes that the situation under Putin's government is becoming increasingly unfavorable for those expressing dissenting political views. Specifically, the lawyer suggests that the arrest and imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an influential oil tycoon, might have a broader political context, potentially serving as an example of how the government is using legal and other measures to suppress opposition. Mikhail Khodorkovsky was a powerful figure in Russia's business and political circles before his arrest. It's significant that his defense lawyer is pointing out the potential political motivations behind his client's incarceration, as this raises questions about the integrity and fairness of Russia's legal system in such cases. It also brings attention to the broader implications of Putin's leadership and potential threats to democracy within the country. To fully understand the report, it's important to consider the legal and political challenges Khodorkovsky faced leading up to his arrest. The jailed tycoon's case has long been a subject of controversy, as some believe that the charges against him were politically motivated, while others argue that they were legitimate. This news report can be seen as a reminder of this ongoing debate, as well as an indication that the defense lawyer is still concerned about the state of democracy in Russia and the rights of political opponents under Putin's government. To summarize, this text is about a defense lawyer's concerns over emerging anti-democratic trends in Russia under President Vladimir Putin. The lawyer, who represents jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, states that these trends are aimed at silencing political opposition, and highlights Khodorkovsky's case as a possible example of the lengths the government is willing to go to maintain its grip on power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does cos x = 0 always imply that sin x = 1? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? pick from the following.  (A). no  (B). yes","output":"The tangent (tan) of an angle theta is defined as the ratio of the sine to the cosine of theta, i.e., tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta). In trigonometry, sine (sin) and cosine (cos) are defined as the ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle corresponding to a given angle. The sine function represents the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle (in a right triangle) to the length of the hypotenuse, while the cosine function represents the ratio of the adjacent side's length to the hypotenuse's length. By the Pythagorean theorem and properties of right triangles, the value of the sine and cosine functions for any angle can never be more than 1 or less than -1. However, the tangent function has no such constraint. Since it is the ratio of sine to cosine, we can see that the value of the tangent function increases and becomes infinity as the cosine function approaches zero, while the sine function remains in the interval +1 and -1. This is why the tangent of an angle may have values greater than 1, while neither sine nor cosine values can be greater than 1. Moving on to the second question: \\"Does cos x=0 always imply sin x=1?\\" No, cos(x)=0 does not always imply that sin(x)=1. The cosine and sine functions have specific values depending on the angle x. When considering the array of angles in which cos(x)=0, we can look at x=90 degrees (or x=π/2 radians) and x=270 degrees (or x=3π/2 radians) where cos(x) is equal to 0. However, the sine function takes different values in these points. When the angle x=90 degrees (or π/2 radians), sin(x) is equal to 1, and when x=270 degrees (or 3π/2 radians), sin(x) is equal to -1. So, while there are cases where cos(x)=0 and sin(x)=1, it does not hold true for all angles where cos(x)=0. Lastly, the multi-choice question: \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\" My choice would be: (A). No These two questions are not the same. The first question asks for the reason why the tangent of an angle can be greater than 1, while the sine and cosine functions cannot be greater than 1. The second question asks if cos(x)=0 implies sin(x)=1, which is an inquiry about the values of sin and cos at specific angle conditions.

He stopped to look at the front row of shoes, and he felt happy to see that the pair of shoes he wanted very much was still there. Looking down, he felt sorry for himself. He really wanted to have them for his birthday. He sadly walked away and thought how to tell his mother about it. He knew she would give him anything he liked if she could. But he also knew very well she had little money. He decided not to go home at once, as he looked worried and his mother would notice  it. So he went to the park and sat on the grass. Then he saw a boy in a wheel chair   . He noticed that the boy moved the wheel with his hands. Tom looked at him carefully and was surprised to see the boy have no feet. He looked at his own feet. \\"It's much better to be without shoes than without feet, \\"he thought. There was no reason   for him to feel so sorry and sad.

Step 1: Gather necessary resources for the task James made sure he had all the necessary ingredients and supplies at hand, such as apples and the wheel for crushing them. He needed to follow the recipe faithfully, and he wanted to use fresh apple juice rather than store-bought for a more authentic and stronger flavor. Step 2: Select the right apples James picked ripe and juicy apples for this task, as they would yield the best flavor and the highest amount of juice. He wanted the dish to be as delicious and satisfying as possible. Step 3: Clean and prepare the apples Before crushing the apples, James rinsed and wiped them thoroughly to ensure they were clean. He also removed any seeds or inedible parts that may affect the taste and quality of the apple juice. Step 4: Crush the apples using the wheel James positioned the wheel over the apples and applied pressure, carefully crushing them to extract the juice. This was a crucial step, as too little pressure would not provide enough juice, while too much pressure could damage the apples and affect the juice's quality. Step 5: Collect and strain the juice As James crushed the apples, the juice flooded out and pooled beneath the wheel. Using a strainer, he carefully separated the juice from the pulp and other solid remnants, ensuring a smooth and clear liquid. This would keep the recipe's texture consistent and help prevent unwanted chunks in the final dish. Step 6: Integrate the apple juice into the recipe With the freshly squeezed apple juice ready, James proceeded to add it to the other ingredients as the recipe instructed. Expertly blending the flavors together, he was confident that the fresh juice would make a significant difference in the taste of the dish. Step 7: Complete the recipe and taste the results Following the steps outlined in the recipe, James cooked and plated the dish, admiring the mouthwatering aroma that filled the kitchen. He took a first bite, allowing the flavors to meld in his mouth, and he couldn't help but smile. The extra effort of using fresh apple juice had paid off, giving the dish an unparalleled depth of flavor and leaving him satisfied with the end result. Step 8: Share with loved ones and friends Feeling proud of his culinary achievement, James decided to share the dish with his family and friends, eager to let them taste the difference that fresh apple juice made. Their expressions of delight and compliments on the dish's fantastic flavor only further confirmed his belief that fresh ingredients truly do make a difference in cooking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As a result, Prime Minister Theresa May had called for a snap election on the 8th of June, 2017. While the intent of this election was to strengthen the Conservative Party and provide a strong mandate for the Brexit negotiations, there was an underlying effect that may have helped the party get over the lingering embarrassment of the 2015 election expense scandal that had haunted the Conservatives for the past few years. This article delves into the events of the scandal, its effects on the Conservative Party, and how the 2017 election played a role in overshadowing the incident. The 2015 Election Expenses Scandal The 2015 election expense scandal, also known as the \\"Battle Bus\\" scandal, occurred following the significant electoral gains made by the Conservative Party during that year's general election. The scandal began to unfold when Channel 4 News accused the Tories of failing to properly declare their expenses for the contentious 2015 contest. The allegations entailed that the Conservative Party had potentially broken election laws by not correctly accounting for significant expenditure in key marginal seats that they won. The Conservative Party had been accused of misreporting their expenses, omitting the costs incurred by their \\"Battle Bus\\" campaign. This campaign involved transporting party activists to closely-contested constituencies to canvas the local electorate and build support for the Conservative candidates ahead of the election. The expenses scandal centered around whether these costs should have been attributed to local or national election expenses; local expenses have strict spending limits, while national expenses have more significant flexibility. The Electoral Commission, a regulatory body overseeing elections in the UK, conducted an extensive investigation on the matter. As a result, the commission levied a record fine of £70,000 on the Conservative Party for inaccurately reporting their expenditure during the 2015 election. Additionally, 14 individuals were reported to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Impact on the Conservative Party This controversy led to immense scrutiny on the Conservative Party and its improper reporting. It negatively impacted the party's image in the public eye, giving rise to numerous critics and detractors who accused the party of trying to manipulate the political system in their favor. Moreover, the scandal raised concerns as to whether key Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) would face criminal charges, potentially losing their seats in case of a guilty verdict. The 2017 Election: An Opportunity to Move On Amidst the Brexit negotiations and other political challenges, Prime Minister Theresa May sought a stronger mandate to bolster her party's stance. The 2017 election provided the perfect opportunity for the Conservative Party to not only strengthen its majority in Parliament but also to overshadow the expenses scandal. The focus on Brexit and the European Union negotiations, coupled with the opposition from the Labour Party and other political entities, shifted the media and public attention away from the expenses scandal. In June 2017, the CPS announced that no further action would be taken against the Conservative Party MPs under investigation in connection with the 2015 election expenses case, citing \\"insufficient evidence\\" to reach the threshold for prosecution. Subsequently, the controversy faded into the background as domestic and international issues took precedence. Conclusion The 2017 general election played a pivotal role in allowing the Conservative Party to move past the lingering embarrassment of the 2015 election expenses scandal. With the media and public attention shifting to Brexit negotiations, and the clearing of MPs under investigation, the party was able to focus on other critical issues and regain the trust of the electorate. While the scandal will remain a cautionary tale of transparency in political campaigns, the 2017 election ultimately allowed the Conservatives to leave it in the past as they continued to guide the UK through the complex landscape of Brexit."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Like other forms of depression, atypical depression can be caused by a mix of contributing factors such as genetics, environment, childhood trauma, and brain chemistry. The symptoms of atypical depression include:  A mood that can lift due to positive things happening in your life. This differs from MDD, in which the mood is usually depressed even in the face of positive events. Hypersomnia, which is sleeping longer than normal, either at night or during increased napping during the day. Sleep totals at least 10 hours or more a day. This is different than MDD, which may cause hypersomnia or insomnia (sleeplessness).  Heavy feeling in the arms or legs, or the feeling of being weighed down, that lasts more than an hour a day  A consistent pattern of sensitivity or personalization in relationships, where a person often thinks they are being rejected or rebuffed when they aren't  Increase in appetite that may cause weight gain. This is different than MDD, which may cause weight gain or weight loss.  Body image issues or a fear of weight gain  Unhealthy relationships with food, such as bulimia, extreme food restrictions, or bingeing To diagnose atypical depression, your doctor will check to see if you have at least five depressive symptoms. These symptoms must occur over a span of at least two weeks. If you have not seen a doctor or therapist for an official diagnosis, see a professional as soon as you can. Your doctor or therapist will assess your medical and family history, any symptoms you have, and your current life circumstances to get a correct diagnosis. Cognitive behavior therapy has proven to be extremely helpful in treating atypical depression. A therapist trained in CBT techniques can teach you behavioral strategies to break the cycle of depression and engage in activities that alleviate depression. It is important that you work with a therapist to ensure your CBT treatment is effective. It's also important to have a therapist in case difficult issues arise, such as dealing with past traumas, that you will need help to work through.  A major part of CBT involves identifying automatic negative or unhelpful thought patterns and challenging these thoughts. The depressed person may have thoughts like, \\"I will never get better\\" or \\"Nobody likes me.\\" The therapist will ask you to notice these thoughts when they occur and will teach you to question whether or not there is really any truth to these thoughts.  For instance, if your negative thought is \\"Nobody likes me,\\" your therapist may point to evidence the the contrary, such as the friends who reached out to spend time with you in the last week. You may have turned these people down because you were feeling depressed, but the evidence shows that people do like you. Depending on your circumstances or history, your sessions may include stress management skills, social skills training, assertiveness skills, or ways to help your deal with draining relationships.  If you have a history of trauma or abuse, your sessions will help you process your experiences to lessen their impact on your mood. Depression is not a condition that you can treat by yourself. It does not matter how strong you are or how rich your experience, you need at least some assistance if you want to beat depression. If you don't treat atypical depression, it may get worse. That is why depression treatment needs to always include psychotherapy and in most cases prescription medications as well. It is essential to always stick to your treatment plan, even when you are feeling better. Quitting medication or therapy on your own or skipping session will likely cause a relapse and you will have to start all over again.","output":"Atypical depression, characterized by symptoms like mood lifts in response to positive events, hypersomnia, weight gain due to increased appetite, body image issues, and sensitivity in relationships, requires at least a two-week span of these symptoms for diagnosis, and while it can be aggravating factors such as genetics, environment, or childhood trauma, it can be effectively treated through cognitive behavior therapy and potentially, prescription medication, under professional supervision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

If Schumer worked at Dash, it would almost make it worthwhile to stand in line to shop the Kardashian Kollection.      When surveying the many, many photos snapped by the press, Schumer did notice a silver lining, though: “I look like a Pantene ad!” She looked so good that Norton suggested she make crawling her new go-to red carpet pose.

To make cold process soap, you heat the oils in your kitchen pot until they're approximately 100 degrees. Slowly add the lye-water mixture and blend the soap until it thickens to trace. After the mixture reaches trace, you add your fragrance, color, and additives and pour it into the mold.. b).

After the mixture reaches trace, you add your fragrance, color, and additives and pour it into the mold..","output":"There are two possible methods to make soap at home, both using the cold process. This answer will provide detailed instructions for each method so that you can choose the one that suits you best. Method a) To make cold process soap using method a, follow the steps below: 1. Gather your ingredients: You will need fats and oils, water, lye (sodium hydroxide), fragrance, colorants, and additives. The most common oils used in soap making are coconut oil, olive oil, and palm oil. You can also use other oils like castor oil, shea butter, or cocoa butter. 2. Prepare the lye solution: Using safety gear like gloves and goggles, carefully mix the lye and water. Slowly pour the lye into the water (never the other way around) while stirring until it's completely dissolved. This process generates heat, so be careful and let the mixture cool down to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 3. Heat the oils: In a large pot, combine all the oils and gently heat them until they reach approximately 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Use a kitchen thermometer to ensure the correct temperature. 4. Combine lye solution and oils: Slowly pour the lye solution into the pot with the oils, stirring constantly. Use a stick blender to blend the soap until it thickens to trace. Trace is the point when the soap has thickened enough to leave a slight trail on the surface when you lift and drizzle some of the mixture. 5. Customize your soap: Once you reach trace, add your desired fragrance, color, and other additives for texture, exfoliants, or skin benefits. Mix thoroughly to ensure even distribution. 6. Pour into mold: Pour the soap mixture into a mold and tap it gently to release any air bubbles. Cover the mold with plastic wrap or a lid, then insulate with towels or blankets to keep the heat in. 7. Let the soap set: Allow the soap to set in the mold for 24-48 hours. After this time, you can remove the soap and cut it into desired shapes and sizes. 8. Cure the soap: Place the soap bars on a drying rack in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area. Allow the soap to cure for 4-6 weeks before using. This process ensures that the soap hardens, becomes milder, and lasts longer. Method b) This method is nearly identical to method a. The only difference lies in the type of pot you use for heating the oils and blending the soap. In method b, you should use a dedicated soap pot instead of a regular kitchen pot. Following the same steps, you'll create cold process soap with this method. Conclusion Both methods are effective for creating cold process soap. The primary difference lies in the type of pot used for heating oils and blending the soap mixture. Whichever method you choose, remember to practice safety measures while handling lye, and enjoy the process of creating your own homemade soap."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Where is a knight likely to be found in the US? Possible A: middle ages, chess set, historical novel, castle, guarding the king  Why is \\"chess set\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Chess set\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because: 1. Understanding the context: The question asks where a knight is likely to be found in the US. The given options include middle ages, chess set, historical novel, castle, and guarding the king. Since the US did not exist during the Middle Ages and is not in the context of a historical novel, we must consider options based on modern-day settings. 2. Interpreting the term \\"knight\\": A knight has multiple meanings. It could refer to a medieval warrior or a chess piece, represented by a horse's head. It is important to recognize the contemporary interpretation of the term in this context and apply the human common sense approach to filter out irrelevant options. 3. Narrowing down the options: Choosing \\"chess set\\" as the answer is a result of eliminating other options through logical reasoning and human common sense in the given context.

According to a new Australian study, a bad mood can actually be good for you. The study showed that being sad could help people to judge others more correctly and was also good for the memory. The study was carried out by Professor Joseph Forgas at the University of New South Wales.\\"People in a bad mood paid more attention to the people and things around them than happy people .Happy people were more likely to believe anything they were told,\\"said Forgas For the study, Forgas and his team did a lot of experiments. During the experiments, they made the participants  feel happy or sad by watching films and thinking about good or bad things of the past. In one of the experiments, happy and sad participants were asked to judge whether some wrong things were true or not. The results showed that people in a bad mood were less likely to believe that these things were true. People in a bad mood were also less likely to make mistakes when they were asked to remember the things that they saw. The study also showed that sad people were better at talking about their thoughts in written style. In fact, the study said that a slightly bad mood could help to make communication more successful. The answer to this question is:","output":"According to a new Australian study conducted by Professor Joseph Forgas, which of the following statements about being in a bad mood is true?  A) Bad mood significantly impairs judgment and memory  B) People in a bad mood are more susceptible to believing everything they are told  C) A bad mood can help people to judge others more accurately and improves memory  D) The study shows no difference between the behavior of people in bad moods and those in good moods.

Zhou attempted to advise North Korean commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics which had allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s, but by some accounts North Korean commanders did not utilize these tactics effectively.

Lauren likes her pizza at a high temperature when reheated so Matt cooks it for a long time. Emily likes her pizza at a lower temperature so Matt only puts hers in the microwave for a couple seconds.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Are the particles in Emily's pizza moving faster or slower than in Lauren's pizza?  Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Answer:","output":"The particles in Emily's pizza are moving slower compared to those in Lauren's pizza. When Matt reheats the leftover pizza, he uses different times for each stepchild based on their temperature preferences. Lauren likes her pizza at a high temperature, so Matt cooks it for a longer time. This leads to the particles in Lauren's pizza gaining more kinetic energy and moving more quickly, resulting in a higher temperature and a warmer pizza. On the other hand, Emily prefers her pizza at a lower temperature, so Matt only puts hers in the microwave for a couple of seconds. This shorter cooking time means that the particles in Emily's pizza do not gain as much kinetic energy. As a result, the particles in Emily's pizza move more slowly, leading to a lower temperature and a cooler pizza. To recap, the particles in Emily's pizza are moving more slowly than those in Lauren's pizza due to the difference in reheating times corresponding to their individual temperature preferences. This difference in particle movement results in Emily's pizza having a lower temperature compared to Lauren's pizza, making it feel cooler when consumed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that offered giving the Chicago Symphony Orchestra three and a half months?, using the article: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

Plenty of girls liked Lawrence and didn't like Hunter because","output":"Hunter had this egotistical air about him, whereas Lawrence possessed a certain charm and genuine warmth that people naturally gravitated towards. Both boys were well-known around the small town, but their reputations couldn't have been more distinct. On a sunny autumn afternoon, the local townspeople gathered for the annual fall festival. The entire area was bustling with excitement. The scent of pumpkin-spiced treats hung in the air, and soft laughter rang throughout the town square. As events unfolded, both Lawrence and Hunter were recruited to assist in the pie-eating contest. Lawrence, being the friendly soul that he was, took his role as the timekeeper with grace and enthusiasm. His goal was to ensure that everyone had a fair chance at winning, and he'd closely monitor the contestants' progress while offering encouraging words. Step 1: Lawrence would attentively observe the pie-eating contest area and carefully gauge the progress of each contestant. Step 2: He would make sure his surroundings were clear of any distractions or obstacles while he tallied the number of pies being consumed. Step 3: Lawrence would periodically communicate the remaining time to the contestants and the audience. He believed that timely updates would inspire the competitors to give their best effort. On the other hand, Hunter was in charge of choosing the pie flavors for the contest. Instead of going about the task diplomatically, he preferred to make hasty and arbitrary selections, catering solely to his tastes. He was more concerned about basking in the attention of the festival-goers than performing his duties with the same dedication as Lawrence. Step 1: Unapologetically, Hunter would grab pies from the assortment available without putting much thought into it. Step 2: He'd ignore the preferences of the contestants or the audience and dismiss their voices in the decision-making process. Step 3: Rather than evenly distributing the selected pies among the contestants or considering their allergies or preferences, Hunter would impose his choices upon them and focus on making himself the center of the event. As the pie-eating contest began, it was apparent to the townspeople that Lawrence's diligent and empathetic nature was a stark contrast to Hunter's selfish and self-centered characteristics. This difference led many, especially the girls in town, to favor Lawrence's company over Hunter's. They appreciated the genuine warmth and authenticity Lawrence brought with him, as opposed to the superficial façade that Hunter seemed to hide behind. Although both young men were presented with the same task, how they approached it and their intentions behind their actions greatly influenced the outcome and the perception of their characters. In the end, it was Lawrence's earnest devotion to serving others that further endeared him to the town's people and solidified his reputation as a beloved and respected citizen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Widows, who were often allowed much control over their own lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they were unable to become priests.\\"?

She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter.  Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Some sunspots are tough to remove and don’t respond well to OTC creams and other products. If you’d like to remove or lighten the sunspots for cosmetic reasons, visit a local dermatologist and ask them to inspect your sunspots. Describe to them how long you’ve had the sunspots and mention what other treatments you’ve tried. In some cases, you may need to visit your general practitioner first and get a referral to a dermatologist. Laser resurfacing can be done at a doctor’s office or hospital. The procedure entails removing upper layers of your skin (which include the unwanted sunspots) with beams of light. Laser resurfacing is expensive—since it’s typically not covered by insurance—but effective in removing sunspots by taking off thin layers of skin. Recovery time can take up to 3 weeks.  You’ll be mildly sedated during the procedure itself. It’s an outpatient procedure, though, so you’ll be dismissed from the doctor’s office or the hospital after it’s done. Before going ahead with the procedure, the doctor will ask you about your medical history and any prescription medications you’re taking. This will help the doctor confirm that the patches are, in fact, sunspots and aren’t caused by another skin condition. If your doctor agrees that a chemical peel will help remove your sunspots, they’ll apply a mild acid to your face. This treated layer of skin—which typically contains the unwanted sunspots—will peel off, allowing fresh new skin to grow in its place. Peels can be performed at some dermatologist offices or at hospitals. The procedure can leave the affected area red for several days. The procedure can cause some lingering pain, so your doctor may suggest you take OTC pain medication or use a cold compress for a week. If you’d rather not treat your entire face but would prefer to focus only on removing sunspots, cryotherapy may be the way to go. When performing this procedure, doctors typically use nitrous oxide to freeze the sunspots. The spots will then scab and fall off in approximately 1 week, leaving un-darkened skin behind. Microdermabrasion is a fairly aggressive way to treat sunspots, so make sure to check with your doctor before having the treatment performed. In the procedure, a doctor will use a special applicator to remove the outermost layer of your skin. This will remove sunspots and leave fresh skin behind. Some doctors will perform the procedure at their office, while others will refer you to a local hospital. Fortunately, the procedure isn’t painful and can be done in 60 minutes. Your skin may feel tight or slightly stretched after the microdermabrasion. If this bothers you, take a dose of OTC pain medication.

Step 2: Define \\"purer\\" For this context, I will assume that \\"purer\\" means a subject that is more fundamental or essential in nature, less subject to individual interpretation, and based mainly on objective principles. Step 3: Evaluate the choices - Faith: Faith is a subjective belief that is often based on personal or spiritual experiences rather than objective evidence. Thus, it does not qualify as a purer subject. - Astronomy: Astronomy is a branch of science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. While it is a specific discipline with clear objectives, it still falls under the broader category of science, so it is not a purer subject. - Discovery: Discovery refers to the act of finding or learning about something new. It is an essential component of all the fields listed, but it is not a stand-alone subject. - Arts: Arts encompass various creative disciplines that express human experiences and emotions.

Given the question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been...

William McCollom stepped down as chief of police in Peachtree City nearly a week after a prosecutor announced that although the New Year's Day shooting appeared accidental, McCollom could eventually face a misdemeanor charge accusing him of recklessly taking a gun to bed after drinking alcohol and taking sleeping medication.  The shooting in Peachtree City, an upscale community of 35,000 people south of Atlanta, left Margaret McCollom paralyzed below the waist.  \\"I have had had two families in Peachtree City -- my police family and my personal family.

Try to do something to relax before bed, like taking a warm bath. Avoid electronic screens in the hours leading up to bedtime, as the blue light can stimulate brain activity that makes sleeping difficult. If you're having trouble sleeping for more than 20 minutes, get up and read a book until you begin to feel sleepy. While regular physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, exercising before your exam can actually lead to inaccurate cholesterol readings.

Your blood pressure and any other exams or blood work required can be negatively affected by food and stimulants.  As stated, coffee can skew blood pressure readings so do not indulge in any caffeine intake until after exams are complete. Fasting at least four hours before blood tests can yield better results.

Please briefly summarize this news article: In the Virginia woods, Mark Warner is trailed by Obamacare Updated 7:27 a.m. ET, 4/17/2014 Wakefield, Virginia (CNN) - Mark Warner was weaving his way through the crowd on a chilly Wednesday afternoon at the Shad Planking, the annual Virginia fish fry that brings beer-sipping politicos together in the tall pines of southeastern Virginia, when a burly man sporting an NRA sticker approached. “Senator, did you read the Affordable Care Act before you voted for it?” he asked. Warner, his brow furrowed earnestly, was prepared. “I’ve outlined a series of changes to it,” he said, gripping the man’s shoulder and jabbing his finger. “Five separate bills.” The Democrat moved along briskly, back-slapping longtime supporters but also facing down several more questions about the health care law he supported from hostile interrogators, most of them backing Republican Ed Gillespie, his likely challenger this year. CNN: Key races to watch in 2014 With his signature grin and rolled-up sleeves, Warner answered them all like the seasoned politician he is. But the specter of the Obamacare pecked at him throughout what was supposed to be a light-hearted afternoon of backwoods politicking and friendly bipartisan joshing. The drive into the 66th annual Shad Planking along Brittles Mill Road in Wakefield was dotted with hundreds of pro-Warner campaign signs. But they were overshadowed by a series of larger placards paid for by the Republican Party of Virginia. “Mark Warner Betrayed Virginia,” they read. “Obamacare’s Deciding Vote.” Warner has a big lead over the little-known Gillespie early polls, and the Republican still has to secure the Senate nomination at a convention in June. But inside the event, Gillespie supporters appeared to outnumber Warner backers by a wide margin. Gillespie had arrived earlier, trailed by staffers and a small horde of volunteers hoisting campaign signs. The first-time candidate, a veteran GOP fixer and lobbyist, worked his campaign booth, handing out beer and taking questions from reporters. “The problem with Sen. Warner is with his record,” Gillespie said. “The more Virginia learns about that record, they’ll be surprised because it’s also at odds with how Sen. Warner portrays himself back home. He is not the independent voice he portrays himself to be, voting 97% of the time President Obama and Harry Reid.” On his way out of the woods, Gillespie bumped into Warner, the first time the two have crossed paths as rival candidates. They chatted briefly about Terry McAuliffe, the new Virginia governor who chaired the Democratic National Committee a decade ago when Gillespie ran the Republican National Committee. Polls: Warner way ahead of Gillespie in Virginia Warner was booked as this year’s headline speaker. He was introduced by John Hager, a former GOP lieutenant governor, who heralded the event’s bipartisan conviviality. “Looks like there’s lots of good gettin’-together,” he chuckled as he surveyed the audience. It wasn’t always that way: The event was started by the segregationist Democrats who used to dominate politics in the commonwealth. Today, women and African-Americans are allowed to participate, but the Shad Planking retains a conservative bent. Wednesday’s vest-wearing crowd was mostly white and mostly male, part Garden and Gun, part Guns and Ammo. In keeping with the spirit of the day and his own political centrism, Warner avoided charged rhetoric in his brief talk on stage. A former governor and Democratic Party chairman, it was his fourth career appearance at the Shad Planking. He had warm words for the Republicans sitting next to him on stage, including George Allen, the former governor and senator who had a wad of tobacco stuffed into his lower lip. Warner declined to roast Gillespie, as speakers often do with their opponents here. His jokes were instead about Virginia’s shifting electoral landscape. “Of course, I know among this crowd I represent an endangered species – a Virginia Democrat,” Warner cracked. “Not unlike Republican women, our numbers here are few.” And then: “You know, they say the face of Virginia is changing. I have been coming to the Shad Planking for nearly 25 years, and as I look out over this crowd, the face of Virginia looks just about the same as it ever was. Just a little more wrinkled.” Complete coverage of the 2014 midterm elections His speech was peppered with feel-goody nods to “the Virginia way,” commonwealth shorthand for a genteel manner of across-the-aisle deal-making that “produces results.” The happy talk glossed over the grid-locked realities of do-nothing Washington and the ideological warfare unfolding in the state capital of Richmond, where a battle over Medicaid expansion could force a government shutdown. Warner huddled with the press after his speech. They wanted to know what elements of his Senate record he would feature in his campaign. He was quick to pivot back to his accomplishments as governor, mainly his landmark 2004 tax reform deal and successful efforts to boost Virginia’s business-friendly reputation. “What Virginians have always appreciated is people who get stuff done,” he said. But what about his Senate record? Warner talked about his “efforts” on issues like debt, infrastructure, immigration, housing and finance - but not health care. He referenced his work with bipartisan “gangs” in the Senate, where “being a gang member is a good thing.” He punted when asked if he would welcome President Barack Obama to campaign with him before November. “There will be time to talk about the campaign,” he said. “I have worked with the President, but there are areas where I disagree with the President.” As examples, Warner pointed to entitlement reform and energy policy, specifically his support for the Keystone XL Pipeline and offshore oil and gas drilling. “So that’s a maybe?” a reporter followed up. Warner was already moving on to shake the next hand. Summary:","output":"Mark Warner, a Democratic Senator from Virginia, recently attended the annual Virginia fish fry event called Shad Planking. There, he was confronted by several individuals questioning his support for the Affordable Care Act. Warner responded by stating that he has proposed changes to the Act through five different bills. Despite having a significant lead over his likely opponent, Republican Ed Gillespie, in early polls, Warner faced a larger number of Gillespie supporters at the event. The two candidates had a brief and polite interaction, discussing the new Virginia governor, Terry McAuliffe. When questioned about his Senate record, Warner focused on his accomplishments while serving as governor and his bipartisan efforts in the Senate on issues including debt, infrastructure, immigration, housing, and finance."},{"instruction":"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Vadim Jean  for the following movie plot:  British director Vadim Jean helmed this British-Canadian family comedy about former private eye Howard Spitz (Kelsey Grammer), who writes hardboiled detective novels.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Texans urge NASA to take retired shuttle away from New York Houston to New York: Displaying a retired space shuttle near a strip joint is no way to treat a precious space artifact. New York, which was awarded one of four shuttles by NASA in a national competition, is looking at revising its plans for displaying the Enterprise orbiter. And Texas lawmakers, still angry that Houston lost out to the Big Apple, are pushing NASA to reconsider. Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) accused New York’s Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum of a \\"bait-and-switch'' in proposing to locate the shuttle \\"next to a bagel joint, a car wash and a strip club.\\" \\"The only place this shuttle should be heading to is Houston’s 'Space City, U.S.A.,' the historical place for all space exploration,\\" he said on the House floor this week. Houston is home to Johnson Space Center, the control center for manned missions and astronaut training facilities. Texans are seizing on a recent New York Times article that reported that the New York museum no longer plans to display the Enterprise on a berth on the Hudson River next to the Intrepid aircraft carrier. Instead the shuttle will be displayed in a parking lot on 12th Avenue. The lot is surrounded by a bagel shop, a car wash, warehouses and a strip club. The New York museum declined to comment beyond a statement from museum President Susan Marenoff-Zausner: “We look forward to having Enterprise at the Intrepid for all New Yorkers and all our visitors to enjoy and continue to be in the planning stages. No final decisions have been made.” Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas), whose district includes Johnson Space Center, is circulating a letter among colleagues calling on NASA to reconsider. And Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) said in a statement, \\"It would be a disgrace if the Enterprise were to end up spending years in an obscure corner of JFK Airport or in a deserted industrial parking lot. If this is what New York City has in mind, NASA should consider awarding Enterprise to another city that will do a better job of displaying this national treasure.'' NASA Administrator Charles Bolden in April selected the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in northern Virginia, Florida’s Kennedy Space Center and the California Science Center in Los Angeles to receive Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour, respectively. New York City’s Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum landed the Enterprise, a test orbiter that never flew in space. Texans were furious that Houston, with its vital role in NASA history, was passed over for, of all places, New York. Poe said at the time that putting a shuttle in Manhattan was \\"like putting the Statue of Liberty in Omaha.'' \\"One Giant Snub for Houston,\\" read the headline in the Houston Chronicle. Talks are underway to move the Explorer, a full-scale mock-up shuttle, from the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida to Space Center Houston at Johnson Space Center. But Texans aren't giving up on trying to land the Enterprise. A NASA spokesman said in a statement that the agency \\"does not foresee any issues that would prevent transferring the Enterprise to Intrepid as scheduled in 2012. NASA firmly stands by its decisions. The locations selected ensure that the greatest number of Americans will have a chance to see these national treasures and learn more about their significant contribution to our nation’s space exploration history.\\" Bolden recently told the NASA inspector general’s office that \\"if it had been strictly a personal decision, his preference would have been to place an orbiter in Houston,\\" but he could not ignore that Space Center Houston had relatively low attendance rates and provided significantly lower international access than the locations selected.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen.  - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event.  - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing.  - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia.  - Tsugiharu Ogiwara (   Ogiwara Tsugiharu ) ( born 20 December 1969 ) is a Japanese nordic combined skier who competed from 1994 to 1998 .

Article: Atacama Desert becomes floral wonderland after historic rainfall in Chile      Updated      Chile's Atacama Desert is one of the driest places on Earth.      But parts of the usually arid landscape are currently covered in a multitude of flowers, following massive downpours earlier in the year linked to this year's \\"Godzilla El Nino\\".      Flash flooding in the country's north region earlier this year killed 25 people and left thousands homeless.      The floral phenomenon — where dormant seeds bloom in spring after high rainfall events — is known as desierto florido, or flowering desert.      The spectacle will not last for much longer as the landscape is expected to return to normal from November.      Topics: deserts, ecology, science-and-technology, human-interest, chile      First posted ||||| A train travels amid a fuschia landscape in the Atacama Desert. The normally barren landscape erupted in a riot of colors this month as desert blooms covered the landscape.      The Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth, is experiencing a riot of color as a rare springtime bloom of flowers covers every hillside.      The explosion of color is the result of rains that swept through the region earlier this year, watering seeds that had lain dormant in the ground for years.      The Atacama Desert typically gets just 0.6 inches (15 millimeters) a year in rainfall, though some places in the region, such as Arica, receive even less, experiencing between 0.04 and 0.12 inches (1 and 3 mm) of rain a year. [See photos of the beautiful blooms in the Atacama Desert]      Most of the time, the desert is an otherworldly, forbidding landscape of steep, rocky hillsides, salt lakes and old lava flows. However, this year, the heaviest rains in two decades hit the region, causing mudslides and overflowing rivers that killed 28 people. In one day in March alone, the town of Antofagasta, Chile was battered with 0.9 inches (23 mm) of rain, the equivalent of seven years of precipitation, turning the entire town into a river of mud, according to The Weather Channel.      Those rare winter rains also watered the parched landscape, nourishing flower seeds that had been buried in the ground for years. The result? A dazzling carpet of pinks, oranges, yellows and purples as far as the eye can see.      The explosion of color has also been a bonanza for the other hardy species that live in the arid landscape. Rodents, lizards, birds and various insects have all been drawn to feast on the 200 plant species that appeared, according to the International Business Times.

In 2010, we had a long flowering but already this year, 2015, has surpassed all the previous ones,\\" Rodrigo Ruiz, acting regional director of Chile's National Tourism Service, Sernatur, told the International Business Times.      Typically, blooms like this occur every five to 10 years due to the lack of rainfall, according to AccuWeather. Those hoping to see the rare blooms in person have just a few more weeks, as the flowers typically begin to die off in early November.      The spectacle was a rare treat, even for those who lived in the area.      \\"For us, it was a miracle because in several years, I believe, based on my age and the time I have been here, I had never seen what the grass looks like until now,\\" Ramon Cortes, a landowner in Vallenar, Chile, told the International Business Times.

The Atacama Desert is located in the north part of the country and barely receives any rain throughout the entire year, making it extremely difficult for any vegetation to grow.      “Rainfall is extremely hard to come by in northern Chile,” AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Kristina Pydynowski said.      However, historic rainfall moved through the region earlier this year which lead to catastrophic flooding, but it also provided water for flower seeds that laid dormant for years.                  Flower blossoms like this only happen roughly every five to ten years due to how scarce rain is.      People traveling to the area to view the spectacle will have until the early part of November before the flowers begin to die and the landscape returns to normal.      RELATED:      Chile Weather Center      Extremely Rare Rain Floods Northern Chile      VIDEO: Avalance of Water and Mud Flooding Atacama Desert      The Atacama Desert is one of the few spots in the entire world that experiences flower blooms of this nature.

Article: Beach volleyball is one of those sports that can be an exciting game to play and watch, or, can just be about some friends getting together to have a great time. It's really easy, and all you need is sand, a net and a group of people, of any age or fitness level, who want to have fun. Beach volleyball can be played with as few as two people on each team, making a total of four people. However, if you are less skilled and experienced in the game, it will be easier to play with a larger team. The more players you have, the less ground each person will be responsible for covering and the more time they will have to recover in between shots. If you only have a few players, each of you will get quite a workout running for the ball after each volley. If you are looking for that relaxing, fun, low-key experience, choose larger teams. Beach volleyball is similar to regular volleyball in its rules. However, even experienced volleyball players do not realize how much more difficult it is to run and jump on sand. Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard ground, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a playground. When a player trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body. While he needs to be able to hit the ball with a great deal of power and accuracy , strengthening his legs is extremely important. Whether you are in it for the competition, or just to have a great time with your friends, beach volleyball can be very exciting and fun. You may even start out with friends and fall in love with the sport. Question: The passage mainly tells us   _  .

As you delve deeper into understanding your own identity and personality, you will uncover new aspects of yourself that may surprise you or challenge your previously held beliefs.

It follows the endeavors of taciturn, aging spymaster George Smiley to uncover a Soviet mole in the British Secret Intelligence Service. Since the time of its publication, the novel has received critical acclaim for its complex social commentary and lack of sensationalism, and remains a staple of the spy fiction genre. Can we draw the following conclusion? Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was released in the 20th century.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was released in the 20th century. The novel was published in 1974, which falls within the 20th century (1901-2000). Authored by British writer John le Carré, the book has become a prominent work in the spy fiction genre. Over the years, it has garnered praise for its intricate narrative, in-depth social commentary, and lack of unnecessary sensationalism. The story revolves around the protagonist, George Smiley, a quiet, aging spymaster who undertakes the mission to unveil a Soviet mole within the British Secret Intelligence Service. The novel delves into the complex world of international espionage, shedding light on the intricate games of deception and betrayal that are synonymous with the Cold War era. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy manages to achieve a fine balance between providing suspenseful and thrilling elements while also offering a realistic portrayal of the dangerous, high-stakes political climate of the time. John le Carré's background in intelligence and his extensive experience working for the British government lend credibility to the story and its characters. Throughout the novel, readers witness the physical and emotional toll that a life of secrecy and subterfuge can have on spies and their personal relationships. This human element serves as a vital counterpoint to the otherwise cold, calculated world of intelligence gathering and covert operations. In addition to receiving critical acclaim, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has been adapted into various mediums. A 1979 BBC miniseries starring Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley was met with praise, and a 2011 film adaptation directed by Tomas Alfredson and featuring an ensemble cast led by Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, and Tom Hardy was similarly well-received. In conclusion, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy's release in 1974 positions it firmly within the 20th-century timeframe. Its influence within the spy fiction genre continues to be felt today, and its blend of suspense, realism, and complex characterizations has cemented its status as a classic work of literature. The novel's examination of the morally ambiguous world of espionage offers readers a compelling glimpse into the difficult decisions and sacrifices made by those operating in the shadows during one of history's most tense and uncertain periods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:A study published in Scientific Reports said a tiny, three-ply cord fragment made from bark was spotted on a stone tool recovered from the Abri du Maras. It implies that Neanderthals understood concepts like pairs, sets and numbers. Twisted fibres provide the basis for clothes, bags, nets and even boats. Neanderthals - whose species died out about 40,000 years ago - are already known to have made birch bark tar, art and shell beads. They also controlled fire, lived in shelters, were skilled hunters of large animals and deliberately buried their dead in graves. Typically, archaeologists and paleoanthropologists only find faunal remains or stone tools at sites like the Abri du Maras. Perishable materials are usually missing. But a team of researchers from France, the US and Spain discovered a fragment of cord adhering to the underside of a 60mm- (2.4-inch-) long stone tool. The cord, believed to have been made with the inner bark of a conifer tree, was approximately 6.2mm long and 0.5mm wide. Three groups of fibres were separated and twisted clockwise in an \\"S-twist\\". Once twisted, the strands were twined anti-clockwise in \\"Z-twist\\" to form a cord. The study - whose lead author was Bruce Hardy of Kenyon College in Ohio - concluded that the production of the cord demonstrated that Neanderthals had a detailed ecological understanding of trees and how to transform them into entirely different functional substances. The production of the cord also implied a cognitive understanding of numeracy and context-sensitive operational memory, according to the study. That is because it required keeping track of multiple, sequential operations simultaneously. \\"Given the ongoing revelations of Neanderthal art and technology, it is difficult to see how we can regard Neanderthals as anything other than the cognitive equals of modern humans,\\" the study said.

Write a title for this article: Your first yoga class is sure to be filled with flexible bodies, strange props, wall-to-wall mirrors, and in some cases, the occasional odd-sounding chant. It’s no surprise that yoga can intimidate even the most hardcore gym rats. But if you’ve seen a devoted yogi body or heard about its many benefits, you’ve probably thought about trying it. To put your mind and body at ease, we asked several seasoned yoga instructors to give us some helpful tips to get you through your first class with your dignity intact. Sign up for a beginner class. A beginner class will ensure that the fundamental principles of alignment and safety guidelines are broken down, says Sam Debicki, a yoga instructor in New York City. If you don’t see any classes that are clearly listed as basic or beginner, she recommends an Iyengar yoga class, which teaches the basic poses. Classes labeled as ‘Hatha,’ ‘alignment,’ or ‘slow flow,’ are also suitable for beginners, as they tend to move at a slow pace and offer precise instruction. Be familiar with a few basic moves. Johan Montijano, an instructor who offers private lessons and teaches at several well-known health clubs, suggests that you 'YouTube' some basic poses like Downward Dog, Upward Dog, Child’s pose and the Warrior poses. If you know the basics, you’ll have a much easier time following along. As Debicki notes, “Beginners tend to have their hands too close to their feet in down dog,” but in fact, the distance should match the distance between your hands and feet as if you were in a plank or push-up position. Wear spandex or long pants. You do a lot of stretching in yoga, and “those little running shorts might not be enough,” says Montijano. “You’re already going to be embarrassed so don’t give yourself another thing to be embarrassed about.” PHOTOS: Hot Celeb Bodies Shaped By Yoga Know the equipment. “Before class starts, set your mat down and grab and props you need,” says Debicki. It's polite to stagger your mat with the person next to you so you avoid bumping elbows. If the instructor doesn’t provide direction as to what equipment you need, “grab two blocks, a blanket and a strap (sometimes referred to as a belt),” says Alie Flynt, a yoga instructor at New York City's YogaWorks studio. \\"These 'yoga toys' will make your life a whole lot easier in the beginning.” Respect yourself. Be mindful of the feedback you receive from your body. Montijano tells beginners, “Respect yourself and be very conservative in your first class.” Flynt says that pain, twinges, dizziness and shortness of breath are all signs to slow down. \\"Just like people don’t like being pushed around, the body doesn’t either,” she adds. “You have to ease into the practice with care and attentiveness.” Avoid any unwanted attention. If you’re a newbie who wants to hide from the more advanced-students, Montijano suggests positioning your mat in the back of the room. There, you can follow along with those in front of you while not worrying about others watching you. Also, “Don’t put your mat against the left side wall of the room,” says Debicki. “A number of poses involve facing the side of the wall and the right side is usually done first,” she explains. If you’re facing the left side of the room, “you won’t have anyone to look at for guidance!” Check your ego at the door. “Don’t compare yourself to other, more advanced students in the class,” says Flynt. Remember that everybody in the room has had a first yoga class — and they’re back for more. Tell your instructor you’re new. Flynt says that by telling the instructor you’re a beginner, they can keep a close eye on you and give you appropriate modifications and variations. “We try to make ourselves especially useful to new yogis and keep an eye out for them,” adds Debicki. Breathe! “When in doubt, breathe, breathe and breathe some more,” says Flynt. “Yoga is the perfect practice to learn to breathe when things are challenging.” Stay for the whole class. Savasana is the final resting pose where you lay on your back with your eyes closed. It may seem silly at first your first class, but you’ll quickly appreciate it as a time for your body and mind to absorb the benefits of the practice “like a sponge” says Flynt. If you absolutely must leave early, “make sure you do it before savasana,” says Debicki.

A female New York City police officer claims she was repeatedly groped and grinded against by a hulking sergeant who nicknamed her his 'work p****.' Ann Cardenas, 29, has accused 300-pound Sgt. David John of sexually abusing and harassing her at the 83rd Precinct in Bushwick, Brooklyn. She claims in a discrimination suit filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the state Human Rights Division that the 41-year-old showed her photos of his penis and crudely told her he wanted to have sex with her as well as rubbing himself against her while grunting. Alleged harassment: Ann Cardenas, 29, has accused Sgt. David John of sexually abusing and harassing her at the 83rd Precinct in Bushwick, Brooklyn, pictured. The Brooklyn district attorney's office and the NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau are also investigating the claims, which Cardenas' lawyer describes as the worst sexual harassment case she's seen. 'There was a frathouse culture in the precinct that was beyond the pale,' Linda Cronin told the New York Daily News. The six-year force veteran describes an occasion in the summer of 2013 when she was sitting on a couch in the precinct and Sgt. John 'grabbed me, threw me down and held me down while trying to kiss me.' The January EEOC complaint continues, 'He then climbed on top of me and would not let me up.' The harassment allegedly went on for more than a year. 'He also showed me pictures of his penis and asked, \\"Is this big? It's bigger than your boyfriend's.\\"' In the complaint she alleged the harassment regularly took place in front of other officers. 'Sgt. John often pulls his pants down in front of me,' she claims. 'He often sleeps in the office with his belt undone, and then will pull his pants down, grab his groin and say, \\"Ann, hold this for me.\\"' John's representatives have denied Cardenas' claims, suggesting there are many holes in her story. Andrew Quinn, a lawyer for the Sergeants Benevolent Association, told the Daily News: 'Sgt. John is aware of the allegations and is in possession of compelling evidence confirming that Officer Cardenas is not being entirely truthful.' The 20-year NYPD veteran has filed for retirement but his departure is on hold during the investigation. He was placed on modified assignment last month.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Tracey Ullman was born Trace Ullman in Slough, Buckinghamshire, the younger of two daughters, to Dorin (nee Cleaver) and Antony John Ullman. Her mother was British, with Roma ancestry, and her father was a Roman Catholic Pole. On the subject of the spelling of her name: \\"My real name is Trace Ullman, but I added the 'y.' My mother said it was spelled the American way, but I don't think she can spell! Along with her television work, Ullman has featured in many films throughout her career. Her first theatrical film was a small role in Paul McCartney's 1984 film Give My Regards to Broad Street. This was followed by a supporting role in the 1985 Meryl Streep drama Plenty. She re-teamed with Streep for 1992's Death Becomes Her, playing Toni, a bartender who runs away with Ernest (Bruce Willis) and lives happily ever after. Director Robert Zemeckis decided to re-shoot the ending, opting for a darker, \\"more risky ending.\\" This meant that Ullman's scenes would have to be cut. \\"We were all heartbroken over losing the character. (She) was so great.\\" Despite the cut, some of her scenes were released in an early trailer for the film. Death Becomes Her is one of two instances in which her scenes in a film have ended up on the cutting room floor. Due to time constraints, her song in 1996's Everyone Says I Love You was deleted.  She made her big screen leading role debut in 1990's I Love You to Death acting alongside Kevin Kline, River Phoenix and Joan Plowright. She subsequently appeared in lead and supporting roles in films such as Robin Hood: Men in Tights, Nancy Savoca's Household Saints, Bullets over Broadway, Small Time Crooks and A Dirty Shame. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her work in Small Time Crooks in 2001.  Her voice work in film includes Tim Burton's Corpse Bride and the computer-animated The Tale of Despereaux. She acted as creative consultant on the 2006 DreamWorks feature, Flushed Away.  In 2014, she played Jack's Mother in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Into the Woods.  Ullman was under serious consideration for a number of roles: Betty Rubble in 1994's The Flintstones; Effie Trinket in The Hunger Games. Director Adrian Lyne asked her to screen test for his film Fatal Attraction. She passed on the idea and the role went to Glenn Close. She was also sought for reuniting with her Plenty co-star Meryl Streep in She-Devil. The part ultimately went to comedian Roseanne Barr. what other films did she do work for?","output":"Tracey Ullman has worked in many films during her career.

Answer: The answer is:","output":"There is a negative tone to this product review.  To understand why the tone of this review is negative, it is essential to analyze the various elements present in the text. The title, \\"Rak's Wreck Review,\\" starts with a word that implies destruction or damage, which sets a negative tone right away. This title suggests that the content will likely involve criticism or dissatisfaction with the product. Moving to the first sentence, it acknowledges Mr. Rak's talent as a guitarist, stating that he is \\"one of the finest guitarists in the world\\" and can \\"play wonderful stuff.\\" This recognition may initially appear to set a positive tone; however, it also serves to heighten the contrast with the ensuing negative comments about the CD. In the second sentence, the reviewer asserts that this particular CD is the \\"worst possible collection\\" of Mr. Rak's music. The strong language used to describe the CD —particularly \\"worse possible\\"—clearly indicates negativity. The reviewer then emphasizes this dissatisfaction by saying that they have not had an enjoyable experience listening to the album. The final sentence of the review urges people not to buy the CD and goes on to say that \\"it is an embarrassment.\\" This is another strong negative statement that reflects the reviewer's opinion of the album. The use of the word \\"embarrassment\\" adds an emotional dimension to the negative tone, as it conveys feelings of shame, discomfort, or awkwardness for both Mr. Rak and the potential listeners. In conclusion, although the review begins by acknowledging Mr. Rak's talent and potential as a guitarist, it quickly transitions to a disparaging commentary on the CD in question. The strong negative language, reinforced by a comparison to better work from the guitarist, establishes a decidedly negative tone in this product review."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

And most of us (72% of shoppers) will be looking to take advantage of free shipping deals this holiday season, according to a new survey by Deloitte. Sometimes it seems you can’t avoid those annoying fees, but that’s probably just because you don’t know all of the tricks. Here are five ways to get free shipping—guaranteed. 1. Check for special deals. The first step is to click over to sites like freeshipping.org and retailmenot.com for shipping deals. During the holidays there are loads of them. Some stores are waiving shipping fees entirely during the Christmas rush. Best Buy and Target, for example, are offering free shipping with no minimum order until January 2, 2016, and December 25, 2015, respectively. Many other stores, including Sears and Kmart, have lowered minimum orders for free shipping. 2. Try ship-to-store options. Many stores, including Walmart, Kohl’s, REI, and Staples, offer this service to web shoppers. When you check out, choose the store pickup option; you’ll get a text or email when your order is ready, and you can drop by to grab your stuff, which will be packed and waiting for you. Some retailers have special pickup areas, so in addition to avoiding crowds in the aisles you can skip waiting in checkout lines. 3. Sign up for a shipping service. Amazon Prime (99 per year) and ShopRunner (79) offer free unlimited two-day shipping. Amazon’s service, of course, is just for Amazon purchases. But it also includes lots of other goodies, including free streaming movies, music, and TV shows, unlimited photo storage, and thousands of free Kindle ebooks. ShopRunner offers free shipping on millions of items at hundreds of retailers, including PetSmart, Staples, and Toys R Us. Another nice perk: ShopRunner gives you free return shipping. If you’re not sure whether you want to commit to paying the annual fee, both services let you sign up now for a one-month free trial. (Just remember to put a note in your calendar, so if you decide to cancel before the free trial is up your credit card will not be charged.) Another option, if you buy lots of stuff at Sears and Kmart, is to sign up for Shop Your Way Max, which gives you a year of free two-day shipping for 49, plus cash back on purchases. Members of the military can get six months of the service free. And Walmart just rolled out its Shipping Pass pilot program with unlimited three-day shipping for 50 a year. For the holidays, the service promises to deliver your purchases by Christmas if you order by December 22. 4. Shop on December 18. It’s this year’s Free Shipping Day extravaganza. And it’s a great day to shop. Hundreds of major retailers’ websites will be offering free shipping with no minimum order and guaranteed delivery by Christmas Eve. Nearly 600 merchants have signed up so far, including Cabela’s, DSW, Lord & Taylor, and Omaha Steaks. Get details at freeshippingday.com. 5. Haggle! Yes, if all else fails, it pays to negotiate. You might be able to finagle free shipping by contacting customer service via phone or live chat at the website. Simply ask for a break on shipping fees. If you ask nicely, you might just get a special shipping deal; worst-case scenario, they might just offer you an extra discount or freebie. Happy holidays!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Reducing resource use means just what it says using fewer resources. There are lots of ways to reduce our use of resources. Buy durable goods. Choose items that are well made so they will last longer. Youll buy fewer items in the long run, so youll save money as well as resources. Thats a win-win! Repair rather than replace. Fix your bike rather than buying a new one. Sew on a button instead of buying a new shirt. Youll use fewer resources and save money. Buy only what you need. Dont buy a gallon of milk if you can only drink half of it before it spoils. Instead, buy a half gallon and drink all of it. You wont be wasting resources (or money!) Buy local. For example, buy local produce at a farmers market, like the one in Figure 2.20. A lot of resources are saved by not shipping goods long distances. Products bought at farmers markets use less packaging, too! About a third of what we throw out is packaging.

After the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War of 1410-1411 not all issues between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Teutonic Knights were settled. The most contentious matter was the border between Samogitia and Prussia. Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas the Great demanded the entire right bank of the Neman River including the town of Memel . The Knights demanded that after deaths of Vytautas and Jogaila, King of Poland, Samogitia would pass to them. Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, agreed to mediate the dispute and appointed Benedict Makrai to hear the arguments. On 3 May 1413, Benedict made the decision and recognized the right bank of the Neman River, including Klaipėda, to Lithuania. The Knights refused to accept this decision and Teutonic Grand Master Heinrich von Plauen ordered Teutonic armies into northern Poland. The army, commanded by Michael Küchmeister von Sternberg, returned into Prussia after just 16 days of campaign. The knights did not believe that the Order, still recovering from the defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, was ready for another war with Poland. Küchmeister deposed von Plauen and became the Grand Master. He attempted to reopen the negotiations with Poland in May 1414. As King Jogaila demanded to reinstate von Plauen and refused any attempts at a compromise, the talks broke down. Answer this question: Which Knights demanded that Samogitia would pass to them?","output":"The Teutonic Knights demanded that Samogitia would pass to them after the deaths of Vytautas and Jogaila. The Teutonic Knights, also known as the Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem, were a medieval Catholic military order involved in the conflict with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland during the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War of 1410-1411. They sought to gain control over Samogitia, a region in the northwestern part of present-day Lithuania, as part of their territorial expansion and religious crusade."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Duke was born in New York City, the only child of tobacco and hydroelectric power tycoon James Buchanan Duke and his second wife, Nanaline Holt Inman, widow of Dr. William Patterson Inman. At his death in 1925, the elder Duke's will bequeathed the majority of his estate to his wife and daughter, along with 17 million in two separate clauses of the will, to The Duke Endowment he had created in 1924. The total value of the estate was not disclosed, but was estimated variously at 60 million to 100 million (equivalent to 837 million to 1.395 billion in 2018), the majority culled from J.B. Duke's holds in Lucky Strike cigarettes. Duke spent her early childhood at Duke Farms, her father's 2,700-acre (11 km2) estate in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey. Duke's first major philanthropic act was to establish Independent Aid, Inc., in 1934, when she was 21 years old, in order to manage the many requests for financial assistance addressed to her. In 1958, she established the Duke Gardens Foundation to endow the public display gardens she started to create at Duke Farms. Her Foundation intended that Duke Gardens \\"reveal the interests and philanthropic aspirations of the Duke family, as well as an appreciation for other cultures and a yearning for global understanding.\\". Duke Gardens were the center of a controversy over the decision by the trustees of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation to close them on May 25, 2008.  In 1968, Duke created the Newport Restoration Foundation with the goal of preserving more than eighty colonial buildings in the town. Historic properties include Rough Point, Samuel Whitehorne House, Prescott Farm, the Buloid-Perry House, the King's Arms Tavern, the Baptist Meetinghouse, and the Cotton House. Seventy-one buildings are rented to tenants. Only five function as museums. She also funded the construction of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India, visited by the Beatles in 1968.  Duke's extensive travels led to an interest in a variety of cultures, and during her lifetime she amassed a considerable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asian art. After her death, numerous pieces were donated to The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco and the Walters Art Museum of Baltimore.  Duke did much additional philanthropic work and was a major benefactor of medical research and child welfare programs. In the late 1980s, Duke donated 2 million to Duke University to be used for AIDS research. Her foundation, Independent Aid, became the Doris Duke Foundation, which still exists as a private grant-making entity. After her death, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation was established in 1996, supporting four national grant making programs and Doris Duke's three estates, Shangri La, Rough Point, and Duke Farms. What charities did Doris Duke sponsor ?","output":"Doris Duke sponsored many charities.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again. She found another doctor that actually treated us like we were human. Question: How did the narrator likely feel about doctor's visits and shots after the Tetanus shot?

Does it follow that \\"There are just a few components of the study. \\"?","output":"In order to determine if the statement \\"There are just a few components of the study\\" follows from the given information, we must first break down the sentence and analyze its meaning. The phrase \\"For purposes of this study, we define these components as follows\\" suggests that specific components have been established and will be defined for the study in question. However, without knowing the number or nature of these components, it is impossible to draw a direct conclusion about whether there are many or just a few components. The word \\"few\\" is relative and can be subjective, as it does not provide a precise quantity. What one person may consider as just a few components, another might perceive as numerous, so it's important to clarify the number of components in the study before drawing any conclusions. To determine if \\"There are just a few components of the study\\" is an appropriate conclusion, we would need to gather more information about the following aspects: 1. The specific number of components in the study: Understanding the exact number of components outlined in the study will allow us to determine if the number is generally considered to be few or many. Depending on the context, this assessment may also include comparing the components in this study to the components in similar studies. If the number of components is significantly smaller than what is commonly found in similar studies, one might consider it as just a few. 2. The complexity of the components: The complexity of each component should also be considered when determining if there are few or many components. If the components are incredibly complex and each component requires a significant amount of study, one may still consider them as just a few, even if the actual number is relatively high. 3. Context within the field of study or discipline: Understanding the context of components within the specific field of study or discipline can help establish whether there are few or many components. If the study in question has fewer components than others within the field, it may be appropriate to describe it as having just a few components. In conclusion, determining whether the statement \\"There are just a few components of the study\\" is accurate depends on gathering additional information about the number, complexity, and context of the study components. Without such data, it would be premature to conclude that there are just a few components in the study."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Kiernan's writing? The answer to this question is:","output":"The controversial Canadian-born American you are referring to is Henry Miller. Born in New York City to Canadian parents, Miller gained fame and notoriety for his autobiographical novels, which often delved into his own experiences and presented his outlook on life in a confessional style.

However, these novels broke new ground in the realm of autobiographical writing, paving the way for a more open and candid mode of self-expression among other writers. One of Miller's disciples, whom James G. Kiernan wrote about, was the American author Anais Nin. The two had a long-lasting friendship and collaboration. Nin, also known for her own confessional style of writing, published her diaries that detailed her life, work, relationships, and inner thoughts.

Answer a question about this article: The growth of the Internet, and particularly distributed search engines like Kazaa and Gnutella, have represented a challenge for copyright policy. The Recording Industry Association of America, in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against copyright infringement, which the industry calls \\"piracy\\". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company Napster, and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act have been enacted, that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the Copyright Directive. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the Conditional Access Directive of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting public domain works, limitations and exceptions to copyright, or uses allowed by the copyright holder. Some copyleft licenses, like GNU GPL 3, are designed to counter that. Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor's program, or for accessibility reasons; however, distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal. What does the recording industry call piracy?","output":"The recording industry refers to copyright infringement as \\"piracy.\\" This term is used to describe the unauthorized copying, distribution, and use of copyrighted material, such as music, movies, software, and other digital works. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has been at the forefront of the fight against copyright infringement, taking legal action against file-sharing platforms and individuals who engage in unauthorized sharing of copyrighted content.

I will iterate through the list. 2. As I iterate, I will separate the items into two secondary lists: one for alphabetical items (letters_list) and one for numerical items (numbers_list). 3. Since the instruction mentions that the order in which the elements appear should be maintained, I won't do any sorting but will simply append items to the secondary lists in the order I encounter them. 4. After the iteration is complete, I will concatenate the two lists with the alphabetical one first. 5. The concatenated list will be the final output of the task. Let's start the implementation: Step 1-3: Separating Alphabetical and Numerical Items Our given list is ['y', '7575', '3941', 'a', '8857', '2961', 'j', '1697', '881', '1783', '9711', '2719', 'Y', 'w', '3065', 'f', 'a', 'I', '7251', 'F', 'o', '5807', '3183', '4971', 'c', '123', 'g', 'o', '7231', '6599', '4687', '563', 'p', '8679']. Now we will begin to separate the alphabetical and numerical items. Looking at our given list and categorizing each item: First item 'y', it's an alphabetical character so we put it in our letters_list. Second item '7575', it's a numerical character so we put it in our numbers_list. Likewise, we continue this process for all items in the list. Step 4: Concatenating the Lists After I complete iterating and sorting the elements into two secondary lists, I now need to concatenate these lists into one, with the list containing the alphabetical items coming first. Step 5: Output the Final List Our final list after concatenation is: ['y', 'a', 'j', 'Y', 'w', 'f', 'a', 'I', 'F', 'o', 'c', 'g', 'o', 'p', '7575', '3941', '8857', '2961', '1697', '881', '1783', '9711', '2719', '3065', '7251', '5807', '3183', '4971', '123', '7231', '6599', '4687', '563', '8679'].

Translate to English English:","output":"The question concerns disadvantaged areas, the European Union's regions facing difficulties. English: The topic pertains to disadvantaged areas, which are regions within the European Union that are experiencing various challenges and hardships. These areas may have limited resources, a lack of infrastructure, or face economic and social disparities when compared to more prosperous regions within the EU. Disadvantaged areas in the European Union may suffer from high unemployment rates, low income levels, and reduced access to education and healthcare services. This is often due to historical, geographical, and socioeconomic factors that contribute to the development gap between regions. The European Union recognizes the need to address these disparities and has implemented several policies and funding programs aimed at promoting regional development, social cohesion, and economic convergence. One of the key strategies to address the challenges faced by disadvantaged areas is the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), which was established to strengthen economic and social cohesion within the EU. The ERDF provides funding to support programs that aim to reduce disparities between regions, promote sustainable development, and improve the overall quality of life for citizens. This includes investing in infrastructure, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and funding research and innovation projects. Another important initiative is the European Social Fund (ESF), which focuses on improving employment opportunities and encouraging social inclusion within disadvantaged areas. The ESF provides funding for programs that assist in the integration of disadvantaged individuals into the labor market, supporting lifelong learning initiatives and fostering social innovation to better address social challenges. Furthermore, the Cohesion Fund is a financial instrument designed to assist member states in improving their economic and social conditions. This fund targets countries with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita below 90% of the EU average, and it provides support for projects in the fields of environment and trans-European networks. In addition to these funding mechanisms, the European Union also encourages cross-border cooperation and partnerships between regions facing similar challenges, as well as sharing best practices and innovative solutions to promote regional development. In summary, disadvantaged areas within the European Union are regions that struggle with various challenges and difficulties, often due to historical, geographical, and socioeconomic factors.

Article: Steroids are anti-inflammatory. By decreasing inflammation, steroids help a dog with CAD feel less itchy. However, steroids have serious long-term side effects, including increased drinking and urinating, liver enlargement, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system. Because CAD requires lifelong therapy, you and your vet will need to discuss the safest way to use steroids to treat your Golden Retriever’s CAD.  Even though steroids rapidly reduce itching and inflammation, your vet’s goal may be to limit or even eliminate the use of steroids for your Golden Retriever.  Prednisone is a type of steroid used to treat CAD. Steroids can be given as short-term relief for flare-ups (temporary episodes of itchiness). They can also be given for the duration of an allergy season, as long as the season is short (a few months or less). As a third option, steroids can be given as long term, low-dose therapy. Your vet will determine which type of steroid therapy your Golden Retriever will need.  If your Golden Retriever needs long term steroid therapy, your vet may prescribe a low dosage to be given every other day. Your vet would start with an initial dosage, then gradually decrease that dosage as your Golden Retriever’s symptoms improve. Do not make changes to the steroid dosage on your own. This could make treatment more challenging. If your Golden Retriever is on long term steroid therapy, monitoring for side effects is very important. In addition to observing your dog at home, your vet will want to see your dog regularly to analyze blood and urine samples. For example, because steroids can cause liver enlargement, your vet will want to look for increased levels of liver enzymes in your dog’s blood. If you notice any side effects (e.g., drinking and urinating more often, diarrhea, increased panting) at home, contact your vet right away. You do not have to wait until your regularly scheduled appointment to have your Golden Retriever examined. In addition to steroids, your vet may prescribe other medications, such as antihistamines, with the goal of limiting or eliminating steroid use. Follow prescription instructions for these other medications. Your vet will determine if the other medications are working well enough to start phasing out the steroids from the treatment plan. What is a summary?","output":"Summary: Steroids like prednisone can provide anti-inflammatory relief for dogs with Canine Atopic Dermatitis (CAD), reducing itchiness. However, they have potential long-term side effects, so veterinarians may aim to limit or eliminate their use. Steroid treatment options include short-term relief, seasonal use, or long-term low-dose therapy. Veterinarians will closely monitor dogs on long-term steroid therapy, regularly analyzing blood and urine samples for any side effects. Additional medications, such as antihistamines, may be prescribed to minimize or remove the need for steroids in managing a Golden Retriever's CAD."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To keep lettuce crisp in your garden as it grows,  (I). grow it in shady, cool places with plenty of water.; (II). grow it in sunny, well lit and somewhat dry places.;","output":"When considering the best solution for growing crisp lettuce in your garden, it is crucial to understand the growth requirements and preferences of this leafy green. Lettuce is a cool-season crop that thrives in moderate temperatures and requires an adequate water supply to maintain its fresh, crisp texture. Bearing this in mind, let's evaluate and compare the two provided solutions. (I) Grow it in shady, cool places with plenty of water: Growing lettuce in cool, shady spots can benefit its growth and help maintain its crisp texture. Lettuce is happiest at temperatures between 60 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 18 degrees Celsius). In hotter climates or during warmer summer months, providing shade can keep the lettuce growing without causing it to wilt or become bitter due to heat stress. Hydration plays an equally important role in lettuce growth. Lettuce is comprised of around 94-96% water, which makes it one of the most water-rich crops. Consistent and proper watering ensures that the lettuce remains turgid and develops a satisfying crunch. Periods of drought or inconsistent water supply can cause the lettuce to become tough, bitter, and prone to bolting, which is when the plant goes to seed and is no longer suitable for eating. (II) Grow it in sunny, well-lit, and somewhat dry places: Lettuce requires sunlight for optimal growth but can be negatively impacted by overly hot and arid environments. It prefers exposure to sunlight for at least 6 hours a day but can also benefit from partial shade to protect it from scorching summer heat. Growing lettuce in an environment that is too dry can lead to issues mentioned earlier, such as bitterness and bolting. Although this choice could, in theory, create crisp lettuce, it is unlikely to be the best available choice for promoting steady growth and the desired quality of lettuce. Upon examining the two options, the better solution for the given goal of maintaining crisp lettuce in your garden as it grows is: (I) Grow it in shady, cool places with plenty of water. This option caters to the lettuce's preferred temperature range, provides protection from excessive heat, and ensures a consistent water supply for optimal hydration. By meeting these requirements, the lettuce has a greater chance of developing the crisp texture that is sought after. However, it is important to keep the lettuce exposed to sunlight or partially shaded environments for the right amount of time so that it can receive the necessary energy for growth. By combining the right temperature, water supply, and light exposure, you can successfully achieve crisp and delicious garden-grown lettuce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people. There is also a vaccine to protect against hepatitis B.  and the situation: Two identical twin brothers go to the doctor to get blood work done and also checked for STDs as part of their routine medical checkups. Neither man thinks they have caught anything, but both are sexually active so they want to get checked out. After getting the test results, the doctor tells Hank that he has strep throat, but no STDs. Jacob is told that he has hepatitis B. The doctor gives both men information about what medication to take and what they need to do to manage their diseases.  Answer the following question: Which man's skin is more likely to turn yellow? A:","output":"A: Jacob's skin is more likely to turn yellow. Since Jacob has been diagnosed with Hepatitis B, he is at risk for experiencing symptoms of the disease, including the yellowing of the skin and eyes, also known as jaundice. This occurs due to the liver's inability to properly process bilirubin, a waste product that results from the breakdown of old red blood cells. Hepatitis B affects the liver, and as the liver function declines, jaundice may develop. On the other hand, Hank has been diagnosed with strep throat, which is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the throat and tonsils, caused by the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Strep throat does not have any direct impact on the liver and therefore does not cause yellowing of the skin and eyes.

Prosecution lawyers in the Jodi Arias murder trial have challenged the defendant over phone records and diary entries they say contradict her claims her boyfriend was a pedophile. Arias, who maintains she was acting in self-defense when she shot Travis Alexander and stabbed him 27 times, has said she walked in on Mr Alexander looking at photographs of young boys. The defendant has said during her testimony that she fled in disgust. Prosecution lawyers have now pressed her to explain why phone records show five calls between the couple on the same day she allegedly ran away in horror. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. One-on-one: Prosecutor Juan Martinez (left) aggressively questioned Jodi Arias (right) on the first day of the prosecution's turn during the ongoing murder trial on Thursday. Prosecutor Juan Martinez also pointed out that Arias and Mr Alexander exchanged text messages throughout the afternoon and evening at the time Arias claims she found her partner looking at the photographs. Arias stuck by her earlier testimony, according to an ABC News report. The prosecution had started their portion. of the Jodi Arias murder trial on Thursday by aggressively questioning. her about different stories that they believe she lied about on the. stand. They used her own journal entries to. argue that she lied about a specific explicit sex romp with boyfriend. Travis Alexander that involved Tootsie pops and Pop Rocks. Mr Martinez went on to attack her scandalous claims that Mr Alexander was sexually. attracted to young boys, examining the timeline of the texts that they. sent one another on the day that she supposedly walked in on him. pleasuring himself to pictures of minors. The supposed incident took place months before Arias shot and stabbed Alexander, killing him reportedly in self defense. Earlier in the trial during her questioning by her defense attorney, Arias said that the reason she missed her friend Lonnie Dworkin's baptism was because she and Alexander were having sex and using the candy as props. Mr Martinez was verbally sparring with Arias as he pushed her to look at her own journal entries where she gave an alternate reason for missing Mr Dworkin's baptism. In doing so, Mr Martinez is likely planning on showing that Arias lied about her sex life with Mr Alexander to the court, bringing into question what else she lies about. At one point, he focused on her 'selective memory' because he said that she said she didn't recall certain points from the trial but was 'able to remember the drink you ordered from Starbucks five years ago'. Grilled: Martinez asks Arias a question about her diary during cross examination in Maricopa County Superior Court today in Phoenix, Arizona. 'You can tell us what kind of sex you had with Mr Alexander many years ago but you can't remember what you said yesterday or a few days ago?' he said during his quick succession of questions. She admitted that she had trouble with her memory when she was under stress. Another issue that he addressed during the first portion of the questioning was the timeline surrounding her damaged finger. Earlier in the trial, she stated that she and Mr Alexander got in a physical altercation in January 2008 when he threw her on the floor and allegedly kicked her in the ribs and finger. She told the court that she didn't want to see a doctor for fear of getting Mr Alexander in trouble so they made a makeshift splint, but the finger- her left ring finger- did not heal and is still damaged to this day. Mr Martinez showed a journal entry that was made after the alleged fight and it made no reference to the fight. He also showed a picture that was taken months after the fight where her hand does not appear damaged. After the fact: The picture on the screen was taken months after she was supposedly kicked by Alexander when he allegedly damaged her finger, but her finger does not look damaged in the picture. Alternate story: The court was also shown video of an interrogation when she told an investigator that fictitious intruders attacked her and caused the hand injury. He also used a videotaped interview. that she had with Detective Esteban Flores who was investigating Mr. Alexander's murder where she said that her finger was damaged on June 4-. the night that she killed Mr Alexander. At that time, however, she was. making up a story about how two intruders broke into Mr Alexander's. home, attacking and killing him. 'Whatever you told us in the past is somewhat suspect,' Mr Martinez said in court. Much of the afternoon was spent parsing over the texts that Mr Alexander and Arias exchanged on the day when she alleged that she caught him pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys. That allegedly occurred on January 21, 2008. The next day, she claims they had the violent altercation that she says resulted in her left ring finger being damaged. One of the main points of Mr Martinez' inquiry is her personal journal, where two days after the alleged fight and three days after the supposed discovery of Mr Alexander's alleged sexual interest in boys, she wrote: 'I haven't written because there is nothing noteworthy to report.' The prosecution comes after eight days where Arias was questioned about her relationship and eventual murder of Mr Alexander. The. questioning style was predictably nicer during that time than it was. today, however, since it was her defense attorney Kirk Nurmi doing the. asking. Her story: Arias' defense is based entirely around the fact that she killed Alexander in self-defense- which she tearfully told the court on Wednesday- and that she lied multiple times to investigators because she was trying to avoid jail. Contemplation: Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi was a much more gentle questioner when he examined Arias. Wednesday was arguably most explosive day of her murder trial, when Arias testified that there was a 'huge gap' in her memory from June 4, 2008 - the day that Alexander died at his Mesa, Arizona home. Arias told jurors that she and Alexander had been taking naked pictures in his shower when she dropped his camera, causing him to erupt in a rage, body-slamming her against the tiles and threatening to kill her. She went on to say that she does not remember stabbing him 27 times but does remember 'accidentally' shooting him. The trial continues.

This game was controversial due to a missed call that drastically altered the Lions' chances of winning. The Seahawks led 13-3 heading into the 4th quarter. Wilson was sacked and fumbled, and the Lions defense ran it back for a touchdown, cutting the deficit to 13-10. After the Seahawks' offense had a 3 and out, the Lions had the ball at their 10-yard line. They reached the red zone a few minutes later. On 3rd and 1, Stafford completed a pass to Calvin Johnson, who reached the Seahawks' 1 yard line and attempted to reach out and score the go ahead touchdown. As Johnson was brought down, Kam Chancellor stripped the ball from him. K.J. Wright then knocked the ball out of the back of the end zone. The referees ruled it a touchback, giving the Seahawks the ball back on their 20-yard line. The Seahawks ran two plays, forcing the Lions to burn their timeouts. On 3rd and 2, Wilson completed a pass to Kearse, gaining the first down.  With no timeouts remaining, the Seahawks kneeled, ran out the clock, and ended the game, winning 13-10. As a result, the Lions dropped to 0-4. Wright's bat play caused controversy afterwards. Minutes after the game ended, the NFL VP of officiating ruled that Wright illegally batted the ball out of the back of endzone. Had the call been made, a penalty would have been assessed that gave the Lions a 1st down at the spot of the fumble, plus half the distance to the goal (6-inch line). The officiating crew was heavily criticized by analysts, fans, and players following the missed call.  Several comparisons were immediately made to the Seahawks' controversial victory over the Green Bay Packers in Week 3 of the 2012 season, which also happened on Monday Night Football.

Background: Clinton Richard Dawkins  (born 26 March 1941) is an English ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was the University of Oxford's Professor for Public Understanding of Science from 1995 until 2008. Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term, meme. With his book The Extended Phenotype (1982), he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment. Context: Dawkins is a prominent critic of creationism, a religious belief that humanity, life, and the universe were created by a deity without recourse to evolution. He has described the Young Earth creationist view that the Earth is only a few thousand years old as \\"a preposterous, mind-shrinking falsehood\\"; and his 1986 book, The Blind Watchmaker, contains a sustained critique of the argument from design, an important creationist argument. In the book, Dawkins argues against the watchmaker analogy made famous by the eighteenth-century English theologian William Paley via his book Natural Theology, in which Paley argues that just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence merely by accident, so too must all living things--with their far greater complexity--be purposefully designed. Dawkins shares the view generally held by scientists that natural selection is sufficient to explain the apparent functionality and non-random complexity of the biological world, and can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, albeit as an automatic, unguided by any designer, nonintelligent, blind watchmaker.  In 1986, Dawkins and biologist John Maynard Smith participated in an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society). In general, however, Dawkins has followed the advice of his late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because \\"what they seek is the oxygen of respectability\\", and doing so would \\"give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all\\". He suggests that creationists \\"don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public.\\" In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that \\"among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know.\\" When Moyers questioned him on the use of the word theory, Dawkins stated that \\"evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening.\\" He added that \\"it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English.\\"  Dawkins has opposed the inclusion of intelligent design in science education, describing it as \\"not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one\\". He has been referred to in the media as \\"Darwin's Rottweiler\\", a reference to English biologist T. H. Huxley, who was known as \\"Darwin's Bulldog\\" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's evolutionary ideas. (The contrasting sobriquet of \\"God's Rottweiler\\" was given to Pope Benedict XVI while he was a cardinal working for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.) He has been a strong critic of the British organisation Truth in Science, which promotes the teaching of creationism in state schools, and whose work Dawkins has described as an \\"educational scandal\\". He plans to subsidise schools through the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science with the delivery of books, DVDs, and pamphlets that counteract their work. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article: 1. Dawkins' significant contributions to evolutionary biology: Aside from his popular book \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" Dawkins is also known for introducing the concept of the extended phenotype in his 1982 book, \\"The Extended Phenotype.\\" This idea posits that the phenotypic effects of a gene can reach beyond an organism's body and influence its environment. 2. Dawkins' position on debates with creationists: Dawkins generally avoids engaging in formal debates with creationists, following the advice of his colleague Stephen Jay Gould. He believes that participating in such debates provides creationists with the \\"oxygen of respectability\\" and acknowledges them in a way that may not be productive. 3. Dawkins' views on intelligent design as a non-scientific argument: Dawkins opposes the inclusion of intelligent design in science education, characterizing it as a religious argument rather than a scientific one. This highlights his commitment to promoting evidence-based reasoning and science education. 4. Dawkins' role as an advocate for evolution: Dawkins has been nicknamed \\"Darwin's Rottweiler\\" due to his fervent support of Charles Darwin's ideas on evolution, similar to how the English biologist T.

The early reign of Abd al-Malik was marked by the revolt of Al-Mukhtar, which was based in Kufa. Al-Mukhtar hoped to elevate Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, another son of Ali, to the caliphate, although Ibn al-Hanafiyyah himself may have had no connection to the revolt. The troops of al-Mukhtar engaged in battles both with the Umayyads in 686, defeating them at the river Khazir near Mosul, and with Ibn al-Zubayr in 687, at which time the revolt of al-Mukhtar was crushed.

You could also use bricks instead of books for the same effect. Set a reminder on your calendar to check the flowers after a few weeks have passed to see if they’re done. They should feel like fine tissue paper. If they aren’t done yet, carefully shut them back into the book for another week to continue pressing them. It takes less time to press flowers with heavy books than if you were to use a wooden flower press because there is considerably more weight being applied from the books. Summary:","output":"To press flowers with heavy books, follow these simple steps to achieve the best results: 1. Choose your flowers: Pick fresh flowers that are not too bulky. Ideally, choose flowers with a relatively flat profile and less moisture content. 2. Prepare the flowers: If necessary, remove excess foliage and ensure the flowers are clean and free from dirt or insects. Arrange the flowers in the desired position, as they will be pressed in the same form. 3. Select your pressing materials: Heavy books, such as dictionaries or encyclopedias, provide the necessary weight to press your flowers effectively. Also, you may opt for bricks or other heavy objects to place on top of the book for additional weight. 4. Prepare paper or tissue: Arrange clean, non-colored paper or tissue paper on a flat surface. This will help absorb moisture from the flowers during the pressing process. 5. Position the flowers: Place the flowers onto the paper or tissue, making sure they do not overlap or touch each other. Carefully cover them with another piece of paper or tissue. 6. Assemble the pressing stack: Select the heaviest book you have, open it to the middle, and place the flowers, along with the paper or tissue, into the book. Close the book and add more heavy books or bricks on top to apply pressure. 7. Press and wait: Allow the flowers to press for about two to three weeks. During this time, the weight of the books will force any moisture out of the flowers and cause them to flatten and dry. 8. Check the progress: After the pressing period, gently open the book and inspect the flowers. They should feel like fine tissue paper. If they are not fully pressed or dried, simply close the book and wait another week before checking again. 9. Preserve and use: Once the flowers are fully pressed and dried, carefully remove them from the book and store them in a safe and dry place, or use them in your desired crafts or display projects. Using heavy books to press flowers is an easy and effective way to preserve their beauty for various decorative purposes. With patience and care, you can create stunning works of art with your pressed flowers."},{"instruction":"Is this product review positive?

Would \\"The Soviet archives record that their burnt remains were recovered and interred in successive locations until 1970 when they were again exhumed, cremated and the ashes scattered.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Adolf Hitler, the infamous dictator and leader of the Nazi Party during World War II, killed himself on April 30, 1945. As the Allies closed in on Berlin and the defeat of Nazi Germany became inevitable, Hitler, along with his wife, Eva Braun, decided to commit suicide in order to avoid capture. They both ingested cyanide capsules, and it is believed that Hitler also shot himself in the head. Your suggested statement, \\"The Soviet archives record that their burnt remains were recovered and interred in successive locations until 1970 when they were again exhumed, cremated and the ashes scattered,\\" is indeed a reasonable answer as it refers to the handling of Hitler's and Braun's remains after their deaths. Upon discovering their bodies, Hitler's SS guards followed his instructions to burn the remains to prevent them from falling into the hands of the advancing Soviet forces. As the Red Army arrived in Berlin shortly after, they uncovered the charred remains of the couple outside the Führerbunker, Hitler's underground Berlin headquarters. Soviet officials brought the remains to Moscow for identification and further examination, during which they concluded that the bodies were indeed those of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. The confirmed remains were then buried in several successive locations throughout the Eastern Bloc. This was done to prevent potential followers from turning Hitler's grave into a Neo-Nazi shrine or pilgrimage site. In 1970, the KGB, under the order of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, decided to dispose of Hitler's and Braun's remains once and for all. They exhumed the remains from their hidden grave in Magdeburg, East Germany, and cremated them in order to remove any identifiable traces. Following cremation, their ashes were scattered in the Biederitz river, thus eliminating any potential grave sites or memorials. In conclusion, Adolf Hitler took his own life on April 30, 1945, and your statement about the handling of his remains by Soviet forces provides an accurate account of how the remains were treated and ultimately disposed of. The cremation and scattering of ashes in 1970 marked the final chapter in the physical legacy of one of history's most infamous figures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The unexpected resignation of David Petraeus as head of the CIA must have come as a shock to many Americans, especially given his impeccable record as a distinguished military commander. But like the greatest heroes from Shakespeare, it would appear that he was not exempt from the time-honored temptations of human folly and self-destruction.  And now the plot is thickening, as details emerge that Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, is involved somehow in the scandal.  As Americans are coming to terms with the revelation of Petraeus' adultery, on the other side of the Atlantic, the feeling among the French can be summed up by a blasÃ© shrug.  Every time a steamy sexual intrigue is laid bare near the corridors of Washington power, the French don't see what all the fuss is about. It's only sex, after all. It's impossible to imagine a French political leader resigning because of an extramarital indiscretion. If this rule were observed, the French parliament would be nearly vacant.  The Petraeus affair: A lot more than sex  The past five French presidents are known to have had at least one -- and in some cases, many more -- mistresses throughout their political career. The current resident of the ElysÃ©e Palace, Francois Hollande, has been caught in the middle of an embarrassing dispute between his previous and current female companions. The French, long used to regarding their leaders with cynical detachment, have been following this tormented domestic feud with interest and maybe some contempt.  1. Who was head of the CIA? 2. Is he still in charge? 3. What happened? 4. Who is in charge of US and NATO troops? 5. In which country? 6. How do the French feel about these events? 7. Where does the French president live? 8.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Understanding El Niño Rain in California. Fires in the tropics. Floods in the southern United States. Unseasonably warm weather on the Eastern Seaboard. All have followed El Niño events in past years. The recurring meteorological phenomenon formed again in 2015, and, according to Martin Hoerling, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it is “ranking up with the biggest in the historical record that we have.” To understand El Niño, it’s useful to remember some basic geography. Picture the equatorial Pacific, the large stretch of ocean with South Asia and Australia to the west, and South America to the east. The Pacific trade winds that blow over the region usually move from east to west, pushing the water at the ocean’s surface toward South Asia and Australia. As the warmest water evaporates, the air fills with moisture and contributes to the monsoon seasons in Asia and Australia. El Niño occurs when the trade winds stop moving. Scientists have been unable to immediately pinpoint the cause of this shift. “A variety of factors can start the cycle in motion at any given time,” Mr. Hoerling said. “In any given El Niño, sometimes after the fact it becomes evident which precursor seemed to tip the balance.” The weather phenomenon known as El Niño can cause dramatic effects around the world. Henry Fountain explains where it comes from. He added: “But once these conditions begin to unfold, they go through a life cycle that lasts on the order of 12 months or so, and there’s a lot of predictability in that.” El Niño events typically occur every two to seven years. The current event was identified about six months ago, though scientists are not yet sure what caused it. What are the effects of El Niño? Scientists do know what happens after the winds stop blowing. The weather reverses: Australia and South Asia experience drought instead of rain, and the Pacific Coast of South America is drenched by a rainy season. The paths of other winds, known as jet streams, are altered. One of them drives Pacific storms to California. Strong El Niño events deliver heavy rain to California (Mr. Hoerling predicted that those could arrive this month), and push warm air across the northern United States and Canada, which helps to explain the current unseasonable warmth on the East Coast. Outside the United States, rains increase along the equatorial Pacific, which means that normally arid regions such as the Galápagos get quite wet. A weak Atlantic hurricane season, like the one this summer, also tends to follow El Niño. And the typhoon season in the tropical west Pacific tends to become very active because the warm ocean spawns more atmospheric disturbances that can develop into storms. Notable effects linked to the 2015 event include drought in Indonesia, which contributed to extensive wildfires in the country. (A similar effect was caused by the last strong El Niño.) Typhoon Melor, which prompted the evacuation of thousands in the Philippines, is also consistent with the effects seen during past El Niños. Why is it called El Niño? According to NASA, fishermen in Latin America recognized that they usually saw the effects of the phenomenon close to Christmas. El Niño, which means the boy in Spanish, refers to the birth of Christ. (Though for some, it will always be associated with Chris Farley). Is El Niño caused by climate change? Evidence suggests that El Niño has been happening for thousands of years. That said, three of the strongest events in the historical record, which goes back about 120 years, have taken place in the last 30 years. Mr. Hoerling said that the question of climate change causing stronger events is being researched. Is El Niño good or bad? Because the phenomenon has been recurring for so long, it is built into ecosystems around the world. Mr. Hoerling pointed out that “some areas that never get rain, only get rain in this phenomenon. It’s a very important climate feature of those regions.” He pointed to parts of California and the Southwestern United States, where the rain delivered by El Niño is essential to the ecology. At the same time, El Niño can cause typhoons, rainstorms and droughts. So while the phenomenon cannot necessarily be categorized as positive or negative, it can have adverse effects on human populations that are best combated by understanding El Niño as well as we can. Hopefully, we’ve helped you to do that.","output":"The article provides an in-depth overview of the meteorological phenomenon known as El Niño, which occurs when the Pacific trade winds stop moving. El Niño is responsible for altering weather patterns globally, causing events like rain in California, fires in the tropics, floods in the US, and unseasonably warm weather on the Eastern Seaboard. The cause of the winds ceasing is not yet known, but once started, an El Niño event has a lifecycle of around 12 months. The effects of El Niño can be noticeable both within and outside of the US, changing usual rain and drought patterns, and causing variations in hurricane and typhoon activity. The studying of El Niño is crucial to understanding its potential impacts on human populations, despite the phenomenon itself being neither inherently bad nor good. Its influence is embedded into ecosystems worldwide, despite its adverse effects, such as typhoons, rainstorms, and droughts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was evident that Robert had taken his time to ensure that each corner was tucked in perfectly, and the creases were smoothed out to complement the crisp, clean appearance of the freshly-laundered linen. The once rumpled bed had transformed into a vision of comfort and tidiness that would rival any upscale hotel. Moreover, Logan appreciated the choice of sheets that Robert had picked out. The luxurious Egyptian cotton fabric not only felt incredibly soft to the touch, but also seemed to hug the contours of the mattress flawlessly. The high thread count gave the sheets a hint of sheen, making them look both elegant and inviting. The subtle striped pattern in a soothing shade of blue was a welcome change from the plain white sheets that they usually used. It created a harmonious and visually appealing backdrop to the arrangement of pillows and added depth to the overall aesthetic of the bedroom. Robert's attention to detail did not go unnoticed, as Logan observed that he had even taken the time to make sure the pillowcases were perfectly aligned, with the open end facing away from the door for a refined finish. The plump pillows complemented the immaculate sheets and enhanced the overall impression of a restful and comfortable sleeping space. Not only did the quality of work impress Logan, but it also made him reflect on the importance of teamwork and how each person's contribution can have a significant impact on a common goal. In this case, the shared responsibility of maintaining a clean and orderly living space contributed to fostering a sense of harmony and mutual respect between the two individuals. Furthermore, it strengthened their bond as roommates and friends, creating a nurturing and supportive environment within their shared living space. In conclusion, Logan's praise for Robert's meticulous approach towards making the bed served as a valuable reminder of the power of appreciation in reinforcing positive behavior. By acknowledging the effort and care put into a seemingly mundane task like making the bed, Logan validated the worth of such actions and encouraged the continuation of taking pride in one's home. It is through such reinforcement of gratitude and appreciation that strong bonds are formed and maintained, allowing individuals to work together in harmony and respect within shared environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Vivacious Lady Context: Lobby card for the film Vivacious Lady is a story of love at first sight between a young botany professor named Peter Morgan Jr. (Stewart) and a nightclub singer named Francey (Rogers). The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom. Keith brings Francey to the prom as his own guest, and Francey, still posing as a student, develops a friendly rapport with Mrs. Morgan, but gets into a nasty brawl with Helen in which Francey accidentally punches Peter's father. Peter says nothing at the prom, but blurts the news to his father just as Mr. Morgan is about to give an important speech, resulting in another argument and another flare-up of Mrs. Morgan's heart condition. This prevents Mrs. Morgan from learning who Francey is, but she accidentally finds out from Francey herself during a conversation in Francey's...

Context: The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

Kidder also spent time growing up in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador. Her mother was from British Columbia, Canada, and her father was from New Mexico, United States. She is of Welsh and English descent. In 2000, Kidder played Eileen Canboro in Apocalypse III: Tribulation, a Christian film dealing with Christian eschatology and the Rapture. Kidder stated afterwards that she did not realize until she was on the set that the movie was serious. Also that year she appeared in three episodes of Peter Benchley's Amazon (1999 TV series), playing a striking role as an insane Canadian woman bent on domination of all the local tribes. In 2001, she played the abusive mother of a serial killer in \\"Pique\\", an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. In 2002, she appeared alongside Crispin Glover and Vanessa Redgrave in the film adaptation of Crime and Punishment.  Kidder appeared on Broadway in The Vagina Monologues in December 2002, and toured with the show for two years.

With the exception of a limitation which illustrates the distinction between forever on the one hand and a definite number on the other, is there any limitation in the clause? Does the promotion, does the preambular recitation of promotion as such place a limit on it? Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? There is no distinction between forever and a definite number.","output":"In order to address this question effectively, we must first analyze the concept of limitations, the distinction between \\"forever\\" and a \\"definite number,\\" and the possible impact of preambular recitations of promotion. After evaluating these elements, we will determine whether the proposed subsequent sentence ties in with the preceding text. 1. Limitations: A limitation refers to a constraint or restriction placed upon a clause, which may be explicitly stated or contextually implied. By mentioning the exception of a limitation that highlights the contrast between \\"forever\\" and a \\"definite number,\\" it is suggested that there may be other limitations at play in the clause. 2. Forever vs. Definite Number: \\"Forever\\" denotes an infinite, inexhaustible duration or continuum without end, while a \\"definite number\\" signifies a fixed, finite value or quantity. The distinction between these two concepts is essential, as it relates to the scope and possible limitations of the clause being discussed. 3. Preambular Recitation of Promotion: The term \\"preambular recitation of promotion\\" likely refers to the objectives, considerations, or aspirations expressed in the preamble of a document that aims to promote or advance a particular interest. While not legally binding in itself, a preamble, by stating the strategic context and purpose of the subsequent clauses, may impose restrictions as to the scope and interpretation of these provisions. Taking into account these elements, it can be inferred that the text suggests the inclusion of the exception, which illustrates the distinction between \\"forever\\" and a \\"definite number,\\" may imply the existence of a limitation within the clause. Consequently, the preambular recitation of promotion could be interpreted as having an indirect restrictive effect on the clause. Now, let's consider the proposed subsequent sentence: \\"There is no distinction between forever and a definite number.\\" Given the preceding text, this sentence appears to contradict the established distinction between \\"forever\\" and a \\"definite number.\\" As previously mentioned, the contrast between these terms is integral to understanding the limitations potentially imposed on the clause by the exception and the preambular recitation of promotion. In conclusion, based on the context provided by the preceding text, the sentence \\"There is no distinction between forever and a definite number\\" seems to be inconsistent with the presented information, as it eliminates the crucial distinction that underlies the discussion on limitations within the clause. The distinction between \\"forever\\" and a \\"definite number\\" is essential to assess the extent of limitations, and dismissing this difference would disrupt the overall coherence and understanding of the text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyze Sentence 1: \\"We need to change old habits and seriously rethink business-as-usual.\\" This sentence implies that there is an urgent need to change established routines and deeply reconsider the standard approach to business. 2. Analyze Sentence 2: \\"He urged employees to 'avoid complacency' and to 'change old habits and seriously rethink business-as-usual.'\\" This sentence conveys that someone (likely a manager or leader) is encouraging employees not to be satisfied with the current state of affairs and to actively alter their customary behaviors and reassess the typical way of conducting business. 3. Compare the sentences: Both sentences emphasize the importance of changing old habits and reevaluating the conventional approach to business. However, Sentence 2 also includes a call to avoid complacency, which isn't explicitly stated in Sentence 1. Additionally, Sentence 2 involves someone urging employees to take these actions, whereas Sentence 1 simply states that these actions are necessary. Conclusion: The two sentences convey similar ideas, but they do not have the exact same meaning. Sentence 2 has an additional component (avoiding complacency) and is framed as a direct directive from a leader to employees, whereas Sentence 1 only conveys the need for change and reevaluation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: For a commuter rushito catch a train, a minute can mean the difference between dinner with the family and foods in the microwave. What most passengers don't realize is that their minute is already there.     Every commuter train that departs from New York Cityabout 900 a d leaves a minute later than scheduled. If the timetable says 8:14, the train will actually leave at 8:15.In other words, if you think you have only a minute to get that trainwell, relax. You have two.     The courtesy minute , in place for decades and published only in private timetables for employees, is meant for those who need the extra time to get off the platform and onto the train.     \\"If everyone knows they get an extra minute, they're going to waste time doing unimportant things,\\" explained Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for the Metro-North Railroad. Told of this article, Ms. Anders laughed. \\"Don't blow our cover!\\"she said.     Entirely hidden from the riding public, the secret minute is an odd departure from the railroad culture of down-to-the-second accuracy. The railroad industry helped invent the concept* of standard time, and time zones were established in the United States in the 1880s, 35 years before they were written into law. And most commuters know their train by the accurate minute it departs. The trains quickly make up the minute:at all other stops, the public timetable is carried out. The courtesy minute does not exist at commuter railroads in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, or San Francisco. But in New York, the secret minute dates back decades.     \\"That's been done forever, from my knowledge,\\" said Jack Swanberg, 70, an unofficial historian of Metro-North. \\"I was the trainmaster starting in 1970 and I'm sure it's been the case since 1870 for all I know.\\" Question: The passage mainly talks about  _  * Answer: Answer:","output":"The passage mainly talks about the \\"courtesy minute\\" in New York City's commuter train system, where trains actually depart a minute later than the scheduled time to give passengers an extra minute to board the train.

Options:  A. feeling refreshed  B. becoming tired  C. restlessness  D. leg cramps  E. sweating Answer:","output":"Option A: Feeling refreshed When you go for a run, your body undergoes substantial physical exertion, and as a result, you tend to sweat and feel heated. Taking a shower after a run is a common practice that serves multiple purposes and offers various benefits in line with common sense. Here's a detailed explanation of the benefits that support Option A: Feeling refreshed: 1. Cleansing: A post-run shower is a necessity to wash away the sweat, dirt, and impurities that accumulate on the skin during the run. This process of cleansing helps to prevent clogged pores, skin irritation, and potential breakouts. 2. Cooling down: After a run, the body's temperature remains elevated, which can lead to prolonged sweating even after completing the exercise. A shower helps lower your body temperature, providing a cooling effect that gradually brings it back to its normal state. 3. Muscle relaxation: A warm shower, in particular, can help soothe and relax tense muscles caused by rigorous physical activity. It helps improve blood circulation, relieving soreness and stiffness in muscles and joints, enhancing the overall recovery process. 4. Stress relief: A possible mental advantage of taking a shower after a run is the reduction in stress levels. The calming, refreshing sensation of the shower helps to clear the mind, relieve any built-up tension, and promote a sense of relaxation. 5. Re-energizing effect: A shower can invigorate the senses, aiding in the restoration of energy levels after the run. The pleasant sensation of clean, fresh skin and the overall refreshed feeling contribute to a more upbeat mood and increased motivation. In conclusion, taking a shower after a run is a sensible and practical habit that contributes to a person's overall well-being and fitness routine. It results in feeling refreshed and offers multiple physical and psychological benefits, allowing for both the body and mind to rejuvenate after exercise."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Philosophy of language seeks to understand the relationship between language and reality. Major topics in philosophy of language are the nature of meaning, intentionality, reference, the constitution of sentences, learning, and thought.  - Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein (26 April 1889  29 April 1951) was an Austrian-British philosopher who worked primarily in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. From 1929 to 1947, Wittgenstein taught at the University of Cambridge. During his lifetime he published just one slim book, the 75-page \\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\\" (1921), one article, one book review and a children's dictionary. His voluminous manuscripts were edited and published posthumously. \\"Philosophical Investigations\\" appeared as a book in 1953, and has since come to be recognised as one of the most important works of philosophy in the twentieth century. His teacher Bertrand Russell described Wittgenstein as \\"the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived; passionate, profound, intense, and dominating.\\"  - A ring name is a stage name used by a professional wrestler, martial artist, or a boxer. While some ring names may have a fictitious first name and surname, others may simply be a nickname from the moves that they do or their talents in the ring.  - The University of WisconsinMadison (also known as University of Wisconsin, Wisconsin, UW, or regionally as UWMadison, or simply Madison) is a public research university in Madison, Wisconsin, United States. Founded when Wisconsin achieved statehood in 1848, UWMadison is the official state university of Wisconsin, and the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin System. It was the first public university established in Wisconsin and remains the oldest and largest public university in the state. It became a land-grant institution in 1866. The main campus includes four National Historic Landmarks.  - In academia, a Festschrift (plural, \\"Festschriften\\" ) is a book honoring a respected person, especially an academic, and presented during his or her lifetime. The term, borrowed from German, could be translated as \\"celebration publication\\" or \\"celebratory (piece of) writing\\" (literally 'party-writing'; cognate with 'feast-script'). A comparable book presented posthumously is called a Gedenkschrift (\\"memorial publication\\"). Sometimes, the Latin term liber amicorum (literally: book of friends) is used for a Festschrift. The German word \\"Festschrift\\" has been incorporated into the English language.  - Martin Stokhof (born 1950, Amsterdam) is a Dutch logician and philosopher. Stokhof wrote a joint Ph.D. dissertation with Jeroen Groenendijk on the semantics of questions, under the supervision of Renate Bartsch and Johan van Benthem. He was also an important figure in the development of dynamic semantics (together with Groenendijk, Veltman and others). He is also known for his work on Ludwig Wittgenstein.  - Intuitionistic logic, sometimes more generally called constructive logic, is a system of symbolic logic that differs from classical logic by replacing the traditional concept of truth with the concept of constructive provability. For example, in classical logic, propositional formulae are always assigned a truth value from the two-element set of trivial propositions formula_1 (\\"true\\" and \\"false\\" respectively) regardless of whether we have direct evidence for either case. This is referred to as the 'law of excluded middle', because it excludes the possibility of any truth value besides 'true' or 'false'. In contrast, propositional formulae in intuitionistic logic are \\"not\\" assigned any definite truth value at all and instead \\"only\\" considered \\"true\\" when we have direct evidence, hence \\"proof\\". (We can also say, instead of the propositional formula being \\"true\\" due to direct evidence, that it is inhabited by a proof in the CurryHoward sense.) Operations in intuitionistic logic therefore preserve justification, with respect to evidence and provability, rather than truth-valuation.  - L. T. F. Gamut was a collective pseudonym for the Dutch logicians Johan van Benthem , Jeroen Groenendijk , Dick de Jongh , Martin Stokhof and Henk Verkuyl . Gamut stands for the Dutch universities of Groningen ( G ) , Amsterdam ( am ) , and Utrecht ( ut ) , then the affiliations of the authors . The initials L. T. F. stand for the discussed topics , respectively , Logic ( Dutch : Logica ) , Language ( Dutch : Taal ) and Philosophy ( Dutch : Filosofie ) .  - Pragmatics is a subfield of linguistics and semiotics that studies the ways in which context contributes to meaning. Pragmatics encompasses speech act theory, conversational implicature, talk in interaction and other approaches to language behavior in philosophy, sociology, linguistics and anthropology. Unlike semantics, which examines meaning that is conventional or \\"coded\\" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge (e.g., grammar, lexicon, etc.) of the speaker and listener, but also on the context of the utterance, any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred intent of the speaker, and other factors. In this respect, pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent ambiguity, since meaning relies on the manner, place, time etc. of an utterance.  - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.  - In modern popular fiction, a superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of costumed heroic character who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine). Fiction centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s, is known as superhero fiction.  - A name is a term used for identification. Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a \\"specific\\" individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called \\"common names\\" or (obsolete) \\"general names\\". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name.  - Semantics (from \\"smantikos\\", \\"significant\\") is primarily the linguistic, and also philosophical study of meaningin language, programming languages, formal logics, and semiotics. It focuses on the relationship between \\"signifiers\\"like words, phrases, signs, and symbolsand what they stand for, their denotation.  - Dick Herman Jacobus de Jongh (born 19 October 1939, Enschede) is a Dutch logician and mathematician and a retired professor at the University of Amsterdam. He received his PhD degree in 1968 from the University of WisconsinMadison under supervision of Stephen Kleene with a dissertation entitled \\"Investigations on the Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus\\". De Jongh is mostly known for his work on proof theory, provability logic and intuitionistic logic. De Jongh is a member of the group collectively publishing under the pseudonym L. T. F. Gamut. In 2004, on the occasion of his retirement, the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the University of Amsterdam published a festschrift in his honor.  - Jeroen Antonius Gerardus Groenendijk (born 20 July 1949, Amsterdam), is a Dutch logician, linguist and philosopher, working on philosophy of language, formal semantics, pragmatics.  - A pen name (\\"nom de plume\\", or \\"literary double\\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \\"real\\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.  - Provability logic is a modal logic, in which the box (or \\"necessity\\") operator is interpreted as 'it is provable that'. The point is to capture the notion of a proof predicate of a reasonably rich formal theory, such as Peano arithmetic.     What entity does 'l. t. f. gamut' has the relation 'field of work' with?

The sentence is talking about the location of the indigenous people in Assam and mentions some districts like Chirang, Baksa, and Udalguri. Here's the translation of the statement to English: In Assam's <MASK>, Chirang, Baksa, and Udalguri districts, there are no major settlements of indigenous people. Moreover, in the Karbi Anglong district, some large indigenous populations reside. However, it is not the land of the Assamese. Now let's examine the options: Option A: বাক্সা (Baksa) - Baksa is already mentioned in the statement, so it doesn't make sense to use it as the <MASK> token. Option B: ধেমাজি (Dhemaji) - This option makes sense as Dhemaji is a district in Assam and can be a part of the districts mentioned in the statement. Option C: মাজুলী (Majuli) - Majuli is a river island, not a district. Therefore, it does not fit the context of the sentence. Option D: কোকৰাঝাৰ (Kokrajhar) - This option also makes sense as Kokrajhar is a district in Assam and can be a part of the districts mentioned in the statement. Both Option B (Dhemaji) and Option D (Kokrajhar) could make sense when replacing the <MASK> token in the statement. However, considering that the sentence discusses indigenous people's settlements and Kokrajhar is essentially well-known for its connection with the Bodoland Territorial Region, it might be a better fit in this context. Therefore, the most logical word to replace the <MASK> token in the statement is: Option D: কোকৰাঝাৰ (Kokrajhar)"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information:  - Jean Auguste Margueritte (15 January 1823  6 September 1870), French General, father of Victor Margueritte and Paul Margueritte.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - A Muslim is someone who follows or practises Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. They also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\\"sunnah \\") as recorded in traditional accounts (\\"hadith\\"). \\"Muslim\\" is an Arabic word meaning \\"one who submits (to God)\\".  - French Algeria (to 1839, then ' afterward; unofficially ', , ') began in 1827 with the blockade of Algiers by the French navy and lasted from 1830 to 1962, under a variety of governmental systems. From 1848 until independence, the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria was administered as an integral part of France. The vast arid interior of Algeria, like the rest of French North Africa, was never considered part of France. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of European immigrants, known as ' and later, as '. However, indigenous Muslims remained a majority of the territory's population throughout its history. Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population with its lack of political and economic status fueled calls for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence, from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the Algerian War began. The war concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 Evian agreements and the July 1962 self-determination referendum.  - Paul Margueritte ( 20 February 1860 -- 29 December 1918 ) was born in French Algeria , the son of General Jean Auguste Margueritte ( 1823 -- 1870 ) , who was mortally wounded in the Battle of Sedan . An account of his life was published by Paul Margueritte as Mon père ( 1884 ; enlarged ed. , 1897 ) . Paul 's name is generally associated with that of his brother , Victor , because of their frequent collaboration . Paul Margueritte , who has given a picture of his home in Algiers in Le Jardin du passé ( 1895 ) , was sent to the military school of La Flèche for the sons of officers , and became in 1880 clerk to the minister of public instruction . He was an amateur mime and wrote several pantomimes , most notably Pierrot assassin de sa femme ( Théâtre de Valvins , 1881 ) and , in collaboration with Fernand Beissier , Colombine pardonnée ( Cercle Funambulesque , 1888 ) .  - Victor Margueritte (1 December 1866  23 March 1942) and his brother Paul Margueritte (18601918), French novelists, both born in Algeria, were the sons of General Jean Auguste Margueritte (18231870), who after an honorable career in Algeria was mortally wounded in the great cavalry charge at Sedan and died in Belgium on 6 September 1870.

He has already authorized 283 strikes in Pakistan, six times more than the number during President George W. Bush's eight years in office. As a result, the number of estimated deaths from the Obama administration's drone strikes is more than four times what it was during the Bush administration -- somewhere between 1,494 and 2,618. Under Obama, the drone campaign, which during the Bush administration had put emphasis on killing significant members of al Qaeda, has undergone a quiet and unheralded shift to focus increasingly on killing Taliban foot soldiers. This year alone, Obama has authorized around 30 drone strikes in Yemen, while OPTIONS: - Bergen only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. - Bush only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. - George W. Bush only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. - Obama only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. - Pakistan only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. - Peter Bergen only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. - Romney only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. - Taliban only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. - Yemen only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. - al Qaeda only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office.","output":"George W. Bush only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. This sentence is consistent with the paragraph which compares the number of drone strikes and policy focus between President Obama's administration and President George W. Bush's administration. The other options are incorrect because: - Bergen, Peter Bergen, and Romney are not relevant to the subject discussed - they didn't hold presidential office. - Pakistan, Taliban, Yemen, and al Qaeda are organizations or countries and not the subject being compared in the paragraph. - The option with Obama contradicts the previous sentence and is not a comparison as the paragraph's focus suggests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The new King and his wife Queen Alexandra had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as \\"the Marlborough House Set\\", were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palace—the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the Belle époque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today—once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel King Edward's heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash's original work.

Let's do this step by step: Step 1: Write down the initial equation: -6n = n - 14 Step 2: Move 'n' from the right side of the equation to the left by subtracting 'n' from both sides. It's important to change the sign of 'n' to '-n' because we're moving it from one side of the equation to the other: -6n - n = n - n - 14 This simplifies to: -7n = -14 Step 3: Now we can solve for 'n' by dividing both sides of the equation by -7: -7n / -7 = -14 / -7 So, n = 2 So, the solution to the equation -6*n = n - 14 is n = 2. If you substitute the value of n back into the original equation, you'll find that it would satisfy the equation: -6*2 = 2 - 14 -12 = -12 As we can see, both sides of the equation are equal when n = 2, which verifies that our solution is correct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the man who scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music.  In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity.... Answer:","output":"The first name of the man who scandalized some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music is Camille. Camille Saint-Saëns was a French composer, organist, conductor, and pianist who accepted a teaching position at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris in 1861. He is known for exposing his students to contemporary music, including works by Schumann, Liszt, and Wagner, which they were typically kept at a distance from due to the rigorous classical nature of their program of study. This unconventional approach to teaching made him a notable and influential figure in the music world, with his best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, expressing immense admiration and gratitude for him throughout his life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for a purported bomb attack on a passenger plane in Somalia earlier this month, saying it was targeted at Western officials and Turkish NATO forces.      The blast punched a one-metre-sized hole in the side of the Airbus A321 about 15 minutes after it had taken off from Mogadishu heading for Djibouti on February 2.      A senior source within the group told Al Jazeera that its initial target was a Turkish Airlines jet, but it only attacked Daallo Airlines after Turkey's national carrier cancelled its flight to the Somali capital.      In a statement obtained by Al Jazeera, the armed group said on Saturday the attack on the Daallo Airlines flight was part of an operation targeting dozens of Western intelligence officials and Turkish NATO forces.      It added that while the operation did not bring down the plane, \\"it struck terror in the hearts of the crusaders, demonstrating to the disbelievers that despite all their security measures and the strenuous efforts they make to conceal their presence, the Mujahideen can and will get to them.\\"      Al Shabab said the operation was \\"retribution for the crimes committed by the coalition of Western crusaders and their intelligence agencies against the Muslims of Somalia\\".      Al Shabab is fighting to overthrow Somalia's government and establish a state based on its interpretation of Islamic law.      READ MORE: Somalia airplane damage 'caused by bomb'      Last week, Somali Transport and Aviation Minister Ali Ahmed Jama said the mid-air explosion, which forced the plane to make an emergency landing, had been caused by a bomb.      The suspected bomber identified as Abdulahi Abdisalam was killed, probably after being propelled out of the aircraft in the explosion, investigators said.      The explosion did not damage the plane's navigation system, and this is what enabled the pilot to make the emergency landing.      READ MORE: Somali jet suspect 'checked in on Turkish Airlines'      Last Sunday, the head of Daallo Airlines told Al Jazeera that the suspected bomber on the jet was meant to board a Turkish Airlines flight.      Mohamed Ibrahim Yassin Olad said the flight's 74 passengers were originally checked in with Turkish Airlines, which flies to Somalia three times a week.      \\"They were not our passengers. Turkish Airlines cancelled its flight from Mogadishu that morning because the incoming flight from Djibouti could not come to Mogadishu because of what they said was strong wind,\\" Olad said.      \\"They requested we carry the passengers on their behalf to Djibouti where they would continue their journey on a Turkish Airlines flight,\\" he added.      The February 2 incident is the third aircraft attack to be claimed by al Shabab.      In December 2014, the group claimed to have shot down a Kenyan army jet over southern Somalia.      In 2007, al Shabab said it had shot down a civilian aircraft carrying supplies and eastern European engineers for the African Union Mission over Mogadishu's airport.      Also in the same year, the rebel group claimed to have shot down an Ethiopian military aircraft in southern Somalia amid fighting with troops from the neighbouring country.

REUTERS/Feisal Omar      MOGADISHU Somalia's al Shabaab insurgents said on Saturday they were responsible for a blast that punched a hole in the fuselage of a plane last week that the government said was caused by a bomb meant to kill everyone on board.      The suspected suicide bomber was sucked out of the Daallo Airlines plane through a one-meter (one-yard) wide hole when the blast ripped open the pressurized cabin in flight, officials said last week.      \\"Harakat Al-Shabaab Al Mujahideen carried out the airborne operation as a retribution for the crimes committed by the coalition of Western crusaders and their intelligence agencies against the Muslims of Somalia,\\" al Shabaab said in an emailed statement.      Last week, U.S. government sources said investigators suspected the Islamist militant group, which has links to al Qaeda, was responsible.      The plane made an emergency landing in the Somali capital.      Daallo's chief executive said the bomber was meant to be on a Turkish Airlines flight that was canceled due to bad weather.      Daallo had picked up the 70 stranded Turkish Airlines passengers to fly them to Djibouti, including the suicide bomber. In total, the flight had 74 passengers.

Born on December 5, 1927, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, or Rama IX, was the ninth monarch of the Chakri Dynasty. The world's longest-reigning monarch, Bhumibol Adulyadej, ruled for a remarkable 70 years until his passing on October 13, 2016. His dedication to the social, economic, and political progress of Thailand earned him unwavering respect and love from his subjects. This article delves into the exceptional life and legacy of the world's longest-reigning monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Early Life King Bhumibol Adulyadej was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, while his father, Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, pursued further studies in public health at Harvard University. Initially, the future king's life was not expected to revolve around the monarchy. His elder brother, King Ananda Mahidol, was the first in line for the throne, with Bhumibol Adulyadej next in line. However, the sudden and tragic passing of King Ananda Mahidol in June 1946 thrust 18-year-old Bhumibol Adulyadej into the role of King. Accession to the Throne On June 9, 1946, King Bhumibol Adulyadej ascended to the throne as the ninth king of the Chakri Dynasty. Initially, the idea of a teenage king caused uncertainty among the Thai people, but over the years, he would prove himself an extraordinary ruler. In 1946, he returned to Switzerland to complete his studies in engineering and law, where he honed both essential skills that would contribute to his successful reign. Accomplishments and Focus on Development Upon his return from Switzerland, King Bhumibol Adulyadej turned his attention to the well-being of his subjects. Realizing that Thailand's development hinged on agricultural prosperity, he became well-versed in agricultural practices and initiated thousands of development projects. These projects focused on addressing critical issues such as water resource management, education, healthcare, land management, and more. King Bhumibol Adulyadej's commitment to his people's welfare is evident through his \\"Sufficient Economy\\" philosophy, where sustainable, local solutions are prioritized. This pragmatic approach enabled Thailand to withstand external challenges while slowly and steadily cultivating self-sustainability, progress, and innovation at the grassroots level. The king's various development projects and his hands-on dedication to the well-being of his citizens made him a beloved figure in Thailand. A Powerful Symbol of Unity Thailand underwent several political turbulence throughout King Bhumibol Adulyadej's reign, from coups and military juntas to democratic transitions. During these tumultuous periods, the monarch emerged as a symbol of unity, stability, and continuity for the Thai people. He acted as an anchor for a society that faced economic, social, and political changes at home and abroad. Although his role was primarily ceremonial, the king maintained a deep connection with his people through compassionate and supportive actions during crises. Cultural Impact and Charitable Endeavors An accomplished musician, King Bhumibol Adulyadej was also a patron of the arts and sought to preserve Thai culture throughout his reign. He founded institutions such as the Thai Music Foundation to encourage the development of Thai music and composed songs that are still integral to the country's cultural fabric today. Furthermore, the king's dedication to charitable endeavors was unmatched. He established numerous royal foundations to address the needs of vulnerable populations, including disabled persons and children in need. His Majesty's volunteer program, which enlists citizens to contribute to community development, exemplifies his tireless efforts to engage and uplift Thai society. Conclusion King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 70-year reign leaves an indelible mark on Thailand, both as a nation and on a personal level for its citizens. His deep compassion, intellect, and commitment to the well-being of his people transformed him into an irreplaceable figure in Thai history. As the world's longest-reigning monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej's extraordinary example of service and leadership transcends his own realm and leaves an inspirational legacy for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Data Interpretation is an important part of Quantitative Aptitude exams and requires an individual to answer questions grounded in plots such as bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, textit{etc}. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in building models which can perform this task by learning from datasets containing triplets of the form {plot, question, answer}. Two such datasets have been proposed in the recent past which contain plots generated from synthetic data with limited (i) x-y axes variables (ii) question templates and (iii) answer vocabulary and hence do not adequately capture the challenges posed by this task. To overcome these limitations of existing datasets, we introduce a new dataset containing 9.7 million question-answer pairs grounded over 270,000 plots with three main differentiators. First, the plots in our dataset contain a wide variety of realistic x-y variables such as CO2 emission, fertility rate, textit{etc. } extracted from  real word data sources such as World Bank, government sites, textit{etc}. Second, the questions in our dataset are more complex as they are based on templates extracted from interesting questions asked by a crowd of workers using a fraction of these plots. Lastly, the answers in our dataset are not restricted to a small vocabulary and a large fraction of the answers seen at test time are not present in the training vocabulary. As a result, existing models for Visual Question Answering which largely use end-to-end models in a multi-class classification framework cannot be used for this task. We establish initial results on this dataset and emphasize the complexity of the task using a multi-staged modular pipeline with various sub-components to (i) extract relevant data from the plot and convert it to a semi-structured table (ii) combine the question with this table and use compositional semantic parsing to arrive at a logical form from which the answer can be derived. We believe that such a modular framework is the best way to go forward as it would enable the research community to independently make progress on all the sub-tasks involved in plot question answering. Solution:","output":"Introduce a new dataset with 9.7M question-answer pairs over 270k plots with diverse x-y variables from real-world sources, complex questions, and unrestricted answer vocabulary, challenging existing Visual Question Answering models.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What's the full name of the man who suggested the Chili Peppers record in Houdini's former mansion? from the following article ?  Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife. Frusciante, however, disagreed with Smith, and said \\"There are definitely ghosts in the house,\\" and Frusciante felt they were \\"very friendly. We [the band] have nothing but warm vibes and happiness everywhere we go in this house.\\"Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea each had their own rooms in the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For more than 30 days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment... A:","output":"The full name of the man who suggested the Chili Peppers record in Houdini's former mansion is Frederick Jay Rubin, commonly known as Rick Rubin. He is a renowned American record producer who contributed to the band's creative output and guided them through the recording process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As he was very busy, the letter lay on his desk till tea-time. Then he opened it and aPS10 note fell out onto his desk. With the note was a short letter. This is what it said: Dear sir, In 1935 I got engaged. But unfortunately at that time there was a lot of unemployment and I lost my job. I was six months without a job and then I got work again. But of course I was very short of money. I came to your shop to buy a wedding ring. The assistant brought some rings for me to look at, but she was called away for a moment, and I put one of the rings in my pocket. When she came back, I said I did not know the size of my girl-friend's finger. So I left the shop without buying a ring. My wife died a short while ago and the fact that I never paid for her ring has been on my conscience   all these years. At the time the ring cost PS2 so I reckon   that is about PS10 at today's price. And I am sending you that amount.

Here are possible answers to this question: - dog's mouth - floor - garage - trouble - nature  I believe the correct choice is \\"trouble\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"trouble\\". When cats are ripping things apart, they are typically engaging in destructive behavior, which can cause issues for their owners and their living environment. This behavior can be due to a variety of reasons, including boredom, stress, a lack of environmental enrichment, or a natural instinct to hunt and play. By tearing things apart, cats may inadvertently cause damage to their surroundings and create a mess. As a result, their owners might consider them to be \\"in trouble\\" due to the consequences of their actions. Let's briefly explore the other options as well: 1. Dog's mouth: This choice doesn't directly relate to the question since it focuses on an interaction between cats and dogs rather than the cat's destructive behavior. 2. Floor: This option mentions the location where the destruction may occur, but it doesn't address the behavior itself. 3. Garage: Similar to the floor, a garage is just a potential location for the cat's destructive behavior, but it doesn't provide an answer to the question. 4.

Here are possible answers to this question: - multiplication - putting together - times - subtraction - multiply  I believe the correct choice is \\"putting together\\", here's why: A:","output":"The question states that Sarah didn't think that they deserved division, implying that she chose an alternative mathematical operation. Among the given options, let's analyze each to determine the correct choice that aligns with Sarah's beliefs: 1. Multiplication: Multiplication is the inverse operation of division and involves combining equal groups of items to find the total quantity. Though this operation is related to division, it may not be the most appropriate choice given Sarah's rejection of division. 2. Putting together: This phrase suggests the act of combining elements or groups in some way, whether it be through addition, organization, or association. In the context of the question, \\"putting together\\" appears to be a reasonable choice that demonstrates Sarah's preference for an alternative method to division. It embodies an action that unites, which is the opposite of division. 3. Times: \\"Times\\" is synonymous with multiplication; therefore, the same rationale as option one applies here. 4. Subtraction: Subtraction is the math operation that involves taking away a certain quantity from another quantity. Although it is a different action than division, it does not fully align with Sarah's preference, as subtraction is still a process that breaks apart or reduces quantities instead of bringing them together. 5. Multiply: This is another term for multiplication, and the same explanation we discussed in the first option is applicable.

Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      The documentary crew spent hours interviewing Robert Durst, who had faced decades of law enforcement scrutiny involving three deaths.      The small crew didn’t have a chance to pour through every audio and video clip, Jarecki said. When extra editors were added, one of the editors was tasked with double-checking the material.      “One of the editors came back and said, ‘I think I found something,” Jarecki told “Good Morning America” Monday.      That something turned out to be Durst, apparently saying to himself, \\"There it is. You're caught\\" and \\"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\\" The off-camera audio clip served as powerful closing moment to the HBO series \\"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\\" which completed its sixth and final episode Sunday.      One day before the episode aired, Durst, 71, was arrested by FBI agents at a New Orleans hotel, in connection with a 2000 murder – one of three he has been suspected of since the 1980s. Durst is scheduled to appear in court today for an extradition hearing.      Jarecki said he was shocked to hear the audio for the first time.      Orleans Parish Sheriffs Office      \\"I sat there in the edit room with my partners, [Marc Smerling and Zac Stuart-Pontier], and we just sort of shook our heads and it took a while to really understand the impact of it. It was so chilling to hear it. It’s disturbing to hear it. It makes you very uncomfortable to hear it,” he said.      The audio was recorded three years ago, Jarecki said. The clip came from the group’s second and final interview of Durst. Jarecki said the documentary producers discussed what to do with the clip.      “We talked a lot about it with our legal advisors and we said, ‘Look, if we go to the authorities now, we’re missing the opportunity for us to actually get the real story from him, and it may take years for them to do that because the truth is, as filmmakers, we have the freedom to do things that maybe the law enforcement authorities wouldn’t have,” Jarecki said. “But at the same time, we didn’t want to hold it back if it was going to take forever. So all we could do was get him into the chair, which took a lot of work, and then, when we had his reaction, that was when we felt the time was right for us to show that to them and that was many, many months ago.      “We’ve been in contact with law enforcement for the past two years, so when we finally found that subsequent submission, what happens in the bathroom, we contacted them and we said, ‘We have something more.’”      Jarecki said the filmmakers did not make a deal with law enforcement over the timing of the arrest.      “We don’t have that kind of power, we’re not in charge of the arrest timing, and we had no idea of the arrest timing,” he said.      The Los Angeles Police Department said the death of Susan Berman has been under investigation since her body was found in her home on Christmas Eve in 2000.      \\"As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death,\\" the LAPD said.      Courtesy of HBO      Durst appeared before a magistrate Sunday in New Orleans where he was ordered held without bond, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office. He has an extradition hearing scheduled for Monday.      \\"We will waive extradition in an attempt to expedite the process of getting into court in LA to answer and defend against the charges,\\" Chip Lewis, Robert Durst’s attorney, told ABC News in a statement.      Durst's brother Douglas Durst said in a statement, \\"We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.\\"      HBO said in a statement, \\"We simply cannot say enough about the brilliant job that Andrew Jarecki and Marc Smerling did in producing The Jinx. Years in the making, their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in Robert Durst's story with the public and law enforcement.\\"      The New York real estate heir has made national headlines as a person of interest or suspect in three deaths since 1982.      Durst has denied killing Berman, but some believed he had a motive, allegedly wanting to silence her about the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen Durst, another death he has been investigated for but never charged. Berman was about to meet with investigators in New York about the disappearance of Kathleen Durst before she died.      Kathleen was officially declared dead in 2001, and Durst has said he has no idea what happened to her. Durst was also charged in the 2001 killing of a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, but he claimed self-defense and was later found not guilty.

Here's an impeccably timed New York Times story about the mind-blowing series finale of HBO's true-crime documentary series. Regarding the evidence collected by director Andrew Jarecki that most certainly led to Durst's arrest in New Orleans on Saturday, the Times reports:      In the final episode, a forensic document examiner the filmmakers asked to analyze Mr. Durst's handwriting concluded that the tics in the note's handwriting \\"are unique to one person and only one person.\\" Mr. Jarecki and [producer Marc Smerling] struggled with whether to bring the letter to law enforcement authorities. If they did so too soon, their lawyers told them, they could be considered law enforcement agents in the event of a prosecution, possibly jeopardizing the material's admissibility in court, Mr. Jarecki said. They also wanted to preserve a journalistic privilege not to disclose sources or testify in court. Still, Mr. Smerling said in an interview, \\"We had a moral obligation and an obligation to the families of the dead to see that justice was done.\\" They began speaking to Los Angeles investigators in early 2013. Near the documentary's end, the filmmakers were packing up their equipment when Mr. Durst asked to use the bathroom. He did not remove his wireless microphone as he closed the door, however, and began to whisper to himself. More than two years passed after the interview before the filmmakers found the audio.      Here's the audio that was allegedly found \\"more than two years\\" after the interview.      [There was a video here]      It's thrilling TV. But as Buzzfeed's Kate Arthur pointed out on Twitter, that two year figure is impossible, per the show's own timeline—and a good indication that Jarecki misrepresented the order of events on the show to create a more suspenseful finale.      The Jinx is suspiciously careful not to reveal exact dates, but based on the documentary and news coverage, the order of events goes something like:      2010: Jarecki's fictionalized version of Kathleen Durst's death, All Good Things was released. Sometime shortly after after this, Durst contacted Jarecki to propose an interview.      Jarecki's fictionalized version of Kathleen Durst's death, All Good Things was released. Sometime shortly after after this, Durst contacted Jarecki to propose an interview. 2010-2013: The bulk of the documentary interviews were filmed, and Jarecki and company discovered a never-before-seen bit of evidence: An envelope, addressed by Durst, with identical handwriting and misspelling to the \\"cadaver\\" note sent to LAPD following Susan Berman's Death.      The bulk of the documentary interviews were filmed, and Jarecki and company discovered a never-before-seen bit of evidence: An envelope, addressed by Durst, with identical handwriting and misspelling to the \\"cadaver\\" note sent to LAPD following Susan Berman's Death. 2012: According to Times reporter Charles Bagli, Jarecki filmed a final interview with Durst in 2012—and not after his 2013 arrest, as the show indicates.

(We've updated the timeline to include new reporting from the Post indicating that Durst's arrest warrant—based on Durst's interviews and what a source describes as \\"other unreleased footage\\"—was signed last week, and the FBI assisted the LAPD in tracking him down, and to include information from an interview with Jarecki in the Times and reporting by Buzzfeed's Kate Aurthur about the date of the interview. Additionally, there is an excerpt below from a CBS This Morning interview, in which Jarecki was asked about the timeline specifically.)      As you can tell, the Times' \\"more than two years\\" couldn't have passed between the final interview if the final interview actually occurred in the order of events presented on the show.      But it now appears that the Times' original reporting may have been right—the gap between the confession and the discovery of the footage could have been years if the interview took place in 2012, as Charles Bagli says. This separate Times ArtsBlog recap of the Jinx finale states the footage in question \\"was taped nearly three years ago but accidentally discovered just nine months ago.\\" If that's true, it means the second interview would have been recorded before his restraining-order arrest, and the events of the show were presented out of order.      So if the Times articles are correct about the timeframe and the second interview occurred sometime in mid-to-late 2012, it came well before Durst's arrest and likely before Jarecki started talking to cops.      Jarecki hasn't commented on when the interview took place yet. From the Times interview:      I'm just trying to clarify if the arrest for being on Douglas Durst's property happened after the second interview. Jarecki: Yeah, I think I've got to get back to you with a proper response on that.      Fishier even than the show's liberal editing is the idea that the filmmakers \\"found\\" the audio after any passage of time—as though they'd have just stopped listening as soon as Durst stepped into the bathroom. Remember, this is a man who they already knew had the habit saying suspicious things after he thought they'd stopped rolling, because that's exactly what he did in Episode 4 of this show, to the chagrin of his lawyer. It is highly doubtful that the sound guy didn't hear Bob Durst say, \\"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course,\\" the moment it came out of his mouth.      In our original finale thread, commenter BurnItAllToTheGround called bullshit on the Times account. See here:      That smells like bullshit. Those guys were hot to get him. They knew he was oblivious to hot mics before. They also knew he didn't take it off when he went into the bathroom. Jarecki is playing us all for fools for the ratings of his show. I think he gave the evidence to the LA DA just in time to result in an arrest immediately prior to his finale. I mean, Durst is guilty as hell, but I don't feel like Jarecki did what he did for the families of the dead or for \\"justice\\".      This makes sense to me. Could it be that Jarecki, Smerling & company sat on Durst's ostensible confession for the sake of making good TV (and/or avoiding legal trouble)? Did they produce an arithmetically challenged lie to cover themselves, or is the Times's reporting off? And what about the timing of Durst's arrest? Was the evidence handed off to ensure that it would happen just in time to publicize a (however unfairly) slept on HBO documentary series? Or was there some kind of backend deal cut between the filmmakers, the cops, and HBO so that the cops got their man, HBO got its publicity, and the viewers got a thrilling package of documentary entertainment and real-life results?      Update: The crew on CBS This Morning grilled Jarecki on the timeline and he claimed it had been \\"months...many months\\" not two years between the recording of Durst's bathroom confession and its discovery:      [There was a video here]      A transcript:      CBS: So when did you all realize you had that recording, and when did you take it to the authorities? Jarecki: Well, we actually interviewed Bob Durst two times. The first time was for about three days back in 2010 and we were surprised that he made a whole bunch of admissions and said things that were kind of shocking. And we thought we would go back to him again at some point. And then we went back to him again a couple years later to show him this new evidence we had discovered. And we thought we were done at the end of the interview. And he reacted in a strong way to the material that we showed him, and then he got up and said goodbye and we thought that was the end. But his microphone kept recording, we always leave the microphone on him, he knows that, and he went to the bathroom while it was recording. And it wasn't until months later that we had an editor listening to material that we had just sort of left behind, thinking, well now we've got all this and everything we've got, we're about to finish the series and we discovered we have this shocking piece of audio. CBS: The New York Times said two years, you said it was months later when you found it. Jarecki: Many months. I mean it was, uh, obviously for us a shock 'cause it was many months since we had sat down with him, and then after sitting down with him we thought well we've got this sort of revelation, which is he was unable to determine which of the two handwritings that we were showing him was his own and, in fact, we think both of them were his own. Um, and then after that he got up and it was not until many months later that we actually realized that the more interesting revelation might have been the secret revelation.      Months. Many months.      Gayle King also asked Jarecki about the spectacular timing of Durst's arrest—just one day before The Jinx's finale. \\"The truth is that we hoped Robert Durst would be arrested as soon as possible, and we were sort of amazed ourselves that he hadn't been arrested for so long,\\" said Jarecki. \\"But the authorities were never communicating with us other than in their normal cordial way, they were going through their investigation.\\"      King asked if Jarecki gave the audio to the authorities before yesterday and Jarecki replied, \\"Long before. They've had that audio for many months.\\"      [H/T Dan Reilly]      Update 2: Jarecki and Smerling are no longer talking to the press.

In Sunday’s finale episode, Durst appears to acknowledge his role in three murder cases that he has been linked to since 1982. The heir to a real estate fortune was arrested in New Orleans on Saturday in connection with the murder of his friend, Susan Berman, in Los Angeles in 2000.      “Killed them all, of course,” he says while talking to himself in a bathroom in a moment captured by the still-live microphone after he squirmed during an interview where Jarecki presents him with handwriting evidence pointing to his guilt in the shooting death of an L.A. woman in 2000.      The timing of Durst’s arrest and the finale of “Jinx” has raised suspicions that the filmmakers and Los Angeles County law enforcement officials coordinated for maximum dramatic effect, but during a Monday appearance on “CBS This Morning,” Jarecki said that law enforcement officials have had the audio recordings and other materials for “many months.”      “The truth is we hoped that Robert Durst would be arrested as soon as possible, and we were sort of amazed ourselves that he hadn’t be been arrested for so long, but the authorities were never communicating with us other than in their normal cordial way,” Jarecki admitted. “They were going through their investigation.”      He also clarified that he and his producing partner Marc Smerling discovered the bathroom audio tape of Durst “months” after the interview was first conducted, not two years later as reported Sunday night by the New York Times. “We actually interviewed Bob Durst two times. The first time was for about three days back in 2010, and we were surprised that he made a whole bunch of admissions and said things that were kind of shocking and we thought we would go back to them again at some point,” Jarecki recalled. “We went back to them again a couple of years later to show him this new evidence that we had discovered and we thought we were done at the end the interview and he reacted in a strong way to the material that we showed him and then he got up and said good-bye and we thought that was the end. But his microphone kept recording. We always leave the microphone on him. He knows that and he went to the bathroom while it was recording. It wasn’t until months later that we had an editor listening to material that we had left behind, thinking, ‘Now we have to listen to everything we got, we’re about to finish the series,’ and we discovered that we had this shocking piece of audio.”      Jarecki said he was also surprised when Durst agreed to cooperate with the making of “Jinx.” Durst’s relationship with Jarecki grew out of the director’s 2010 narrative feature, “All Good Things,” that was a fictionalized version of the Durst story.      “What’s amazing to me is that he came to us, knowing what he knew about his life. We didn’t know that. All we could do is assume that some bad things had happened. We weren’t exactly sure what,” Jarecki told “CBS This Morning.” “He volunteered to come and sit for an interview.”      Asked whether he thought Durst was mentally unbalanced, Jarecki said: “Whether he’s crazy or not, he is a very well-organized, well-financed person.”      Watch the interview with Jarecki below: ||||| Since his first wife vanished more than three decades ago, Robert A. Durst, the eccentric and estranged son of one of New York’s most prominent real estate dynasties, has lived under the suspicious gaze of law enforcement officials in three states.      They have followed his path from New York City to Los Angeles, where one of his closest friends was found dead in her home in 2000. They have tracked him to Galveston, Tex., where he fled after investigators reopened the case of his wife’s disappearance, and where he posed as a mute woman and shot and dismembered a neighbor in 2001.      Mr. Durst was acquitted in the Texas killing, and was never arrested in the disappearance of his wife or the death of his friend. But on Saturday, he found himself in custody once again, arrested on a charge of murder as he walked into a New Orleans hotel he had checked into under a false name.      On Sunday night, in the final moments of the final episode of a six-part HBO documentary about him, “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,” Mr. Durst seemed to veer toward a confession that could lift the shroud of mystery that surrounds the deaths of three people over the course of three decades. ||||| March 16, 2015, 8:01 AM |There was a real-life dramatic ending to a documentary about Robert Durst, an eccentric millionaire accused of murder of his friend, Susan Berman. HBO aired the finale of \\"The Jinx\\" Sunday night. Director Andrew Jarecki joins \\"CBS This Morning\\" to discuss the bombshell interview. ||||| Summary:","output":"The six-part documentary series, \\"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\\" follows the life of real estate heir Robert Durst, who has faced decades of law enforcement scrutiny involving three deaths. Documentary filmmakers Andrew Jarecki, Marc Smerling, and Zac Stuart-Pontier interviewed Durst over several hours, eventually discovering a powerful clue: audio of Durst seemingly confessing to the murders during a bathroom break, with his microphone still on. This audio was acquired three years prior and, after consulting with legal advisors, was provided to law enforcement, leading to Durst's arrest in connection with a 2000 murder. Jarecki says they did not make a deal with law enforcement over the timing of the arrest, but the filmmakers hoped Durst would be caught as soon as possible."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Process: - Take out an ice cube tray - Fill the tray with water from the faucet - Put the ice cube tray in the freezer - Wait for several hours - The water will freeze and become ice - Remove the ice cube tray from the freezer - Remove the ice cubes from the tray.  Question: suppose If no food is eaten happens, how will it affect LESS ice cubes being made.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"C: No effect The production of ice cubes from water is not directly related to the consumption of food. In the process outlined above, the key factors affecting the formation of ice cubes are: 1. Availability of water: The first step requires filling the ice cube tray with water from the faucet. Access to water and the ability to distribute it into the tray is essential for creating ice cubes. This is unaffected by the consumption of food. 2. Functioning freezer: For water to freeze into ice cubes, it must be placed in a freezer with a temperature low enough to facilitate freezing. The temperature should be maintained below the freezing point of water, which is 0°C (32°F). The efficiency of the freezer does not depend on whether food is consumed or not. 3. Duration of freezing process: The length of time required for the water in the tray to freeze and form ice cubes depends on the freezer's temperature, the amount of water in the tray, and the tray's design. As long as these factors remain unchanged, the amount of time needed to create ice cubes will not be affected by food consumption. 4. Removal of ice cubes: The final step involves removing the ice cubes from the tray, which is purely a mechanical process. The presence or absence of food has no direct impact on removing the ice cubes from their trays. In conclusion, the amount of ice cubes made depends on factors like the availability of water, the efficiency of the freezer, and the duration of the freezing process. The consumption of food does not have any direct impact on these factors, thus suggesting that there would be no effect on the number of ice cubes produced if no food is eaten."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? a laugh","output":"By itself, the phrase \\"a laugh\\" doesn't specifically carry either a positive or negative sentiment — it's a neutral statement as it lacks context and further attributes that could lean towards an emotional judgment. However, in general usage, laughter is most commonly associated with positivity, happiness, and enjoyment. People tend to laugh when they find something amusing, engaging, or joyful. Therefore, if this phrase were to be evaluated in a general context, it would likely hold a positive sentiment. However, sentiment analysis can be quite contextual and subjective. The tone of sentiment can change significantly depending on the sentence where the phrase is used. For example, \\"We had a laugh about it,\\" generally holds a positive sentiment since the underlying implication could be that the speakers enjoyed the situation or found it funny. But in a different sentence, such as \\"She gave a laugh of disbelief,\\" the sentiment could potentially be seen as more negative as the laughter here may be a response to a negative feeling or vaguely unsettling experience. Thus it's highly essential to evaluate the sentiment of a word or phrase within the context it's used. Without more text or context, it's challenging to definitively tag the phrase \\"a laugh\\" as being of positive or negative sentiment beyond general associations which may, in certain circumstances, be entirely incorrect.

Given the question: Given the following context:  In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

Finally, after years of awaiting a new film to continue the sexual mayhem of \\"Basic Instinct\\", we have been given a great sequel that is packed with the right elements needed for a franchise such as this! I remember everything about the original, the steam, the romance, the sex, the interrogation, the music (by the master Jerry Goldsmith), and everything else from violence and murder, to intense confrontations of all kind! Make no mistake, \\"Basic Instinct\\" was a real winner for audiences everywhere. I can remember in 2001 when we were first given the news about such a sequel. Five years later, we have it. I never would have thought it to end up such as this. When it was declared a dropped project, time sure couldn't tell if it was ever a real possibility to begin with. Well, I guess we now know anything's possible in this case. Even if the original director, or writer are not present, all we need is the glamorous, always reliable Sharon Stone, and we have a done deal! Please, hear me out... When people say that this film is bad, I think it is only due to the fact that the style is extreme, and slightly dated. I use the word \\"dated\\" only because we have not seen a certain film of the like in many years, and audiences have become adapted to the pointless, boring storytelling seen in other movies that actually make money, and the only reason they make such big numbers is because those films are family friendly. Who needs hole some and clean? Of course it's a pleasant thing to have, but c'mon! Escapism is really seldom these days, and \\"Basic Instinct 2\\" gives us real fans what we've been expecting. This film is not an Academy Award winner, nor does it try to be. It simply delivers the die-hard fans what they have been expecting. It's a film for fun. Movies today seem to take themselves way too seriously, but this film is just loose and fun, not taking itself seriously, not too seriously anyway. That said, I shall evaluate the film. The film is a fast-paced film from the first second, as we see Cathernine Tremell in a car, speeding at 110 MPH-and enjoying lustful thrills doing so. Perhaps sex and driving does not mix, because our sexy novelist takes a bad turn and...well, she gets away unharmed, but her studly partner doesn't fare too well. Once again, Tremell is the primary suspect of the accident, and will be put under analyst's and psychiatrists. Dr. Michael Glass (Morrissey) is automatically drawn to to her from the first moment he meets her. Like another criminal investigator before him, he is entranced and seduced, slowly, and surely. His denial of it all begins to crumble around him as she weaves a spell only she has the power to do. Tramell is possibly more dangerous now, than she was before,but like the first one, we'll never really know, will we? Once the seduction is in motion, jealousy, rage, drugs, and a plateful of erotic scenery ensues! This film does not recycle the first one, but rather mentions the previous films incidents briefly from time to time. This is a good thing. It lets us as an audience know that the script has been written to bring the level up a notch or two. Sharon Stone dazzles us again, as though 14 years has not come to pass. Her second run of the deceitful novelist is right on the spot as earlier. Just awesome! David Morrissey is well cast, and manages pretty well. The fact that a non-popular star was chosen, makes his performance all the more enjoyable because we as an audience have no background on him, just what we see him perform. My final thought-8.5 to 9 out of 10. So it's not the first one, nor can it live up to the first ones prize winning place. It can, however, live up to the standards set by the first film, and it does folks! It does. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review is positive.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The parking lot for the Center for Addictions Treatment was in the back of the building, as was the front door. The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating. The telephone rang before Ray was even half-finished with his cigarette. \\"Admit it now, Ray.\\" She sounded petulant. \\"Fine, I admit it.

A leading scientist was kicked out of a classic music concert after trying to crowd surf during a performance of Handel’s Messiah, it has emerged. Dr David Glowacki, a Research Fellow at the Royal Society and visiting professor at the prestigious Stanford University in the US, was ejected from the Bristol Old Vic after getting ‘overexcited’ during the performance. His apparent crowd surfing came as audience members were encouraged to move towards the front of the stage with their drinks and ‘clap or whoop when you like’ by the theatre’s artistic director, Tom Morris. However, while the crowd were warned not to ‘shush other people’, Mr Morris said the respected chemist got ‘very excited’ during the Hallelujah Chorus. Witnesses claim he was lurching from side to side with his hands raised and whooping before attempting to crowd-surf, The Independent reported. Apparently irritated by the commotion, audience members attempted to eject the professor from the main arena. Mr Morris, who directed War Horse at the National Theatre, told The Independent: ‘The Bristol Proms are contributing to a ground-breaking way of thinking which will pave the way for a new kind of classical concert. ‘But by allowing an audience to respond in whatever way they want, you also allow an audience to self-regulate, as we discovered.’ However, Dr Glowacki, who said he was not. under the influence of alcohol, defended his actions and accused both.

Write a title for this article: (WASHINGTON)— The Supreme Court seems deeply divided over the arrangement devised by the Obama administration to spare faith-based groups from having to pay for birth control for women covered under their health plans. The court’s conservative justices sounded supportive Wednesday of the groups’ complaint that the administration’s effort violates their religious rights. The four liberal justices seem likely to vote to uphold the accommodation offered to faith-based colleges, charities and advocacy groups. A 4-4 tie would uphold four appeals court rulings in favor of the administration. But different rules would apply in parts of the country in which another appeals court has sided with the challengers. Wednesday was the sixth anniversary of President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul; the case in front of the justices was the law’s fourth Supreme Court appearance in five years. The issue this time is the arrangement the administration devised to make sure that religiously oriented groups do not have to pay for or arrange the provision of contraceptives to which they object, while ensuring that women covered under their health plans still can obtain birth control. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy voiced sympathy for the groups’ claim that they remain complicit in providing morally objectionable contraceptives under the government’s plan. “Hijacking. It seems to me that’s an accurate description of what the government wants to do,” Roberts said. Kennedy also used that word during 90 minutes of crisp arguments and frequent interruptions by the justices. Only Justice Clarence Thomas asked no questions, but he has repeatedly sided with the health law’s challengers. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the administration’s arrangement takes into account women who are covered by the affected plans and “have a real need for contraception.” Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan also asked questions that signaled their support for the administration. Eight justices are hearing the case, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month. The challengers could find it hard, without Scalia, to attract the five votes they need to prevail. Contraception is among a range of preventive services that must be provided at no extra charge under the health care law. The administration pointed to research showing that the high cost of some methods of contraception discourages women from using them. A very effective means of birth control, the intrauterine device, can cost up to 1,000. Houses of worship and other religious institutions whose primary purpose is to spread the faith are exempt from the birth control requirement. Other faith-affiliated groups that oppose some or all contraception have to tell the government or their insurers that they object. In 2014, the justices divided 5-4, with Scalia in the majority, to allow some “closely held” businesses with religious objections to refuse to pay for contraceptives for women. That case involved the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores and other companies that said their rights were being violated under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The nonprofit groups are invoking the same law in asking that the government find a way that does not involve them or their insurers if it wishes to provide birth control to women covered by their health plans. Among the challengers are Bishop David Zubik, head of the Catholic Diocese in Pittsburgh; the Little Sisters of the Poor, nuns who run more than two dozen nursing homes for impoverished seniors; evangelical and Catholic colleges in Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington, D.C., and the anti-abortion advocacy group Priests for Life. The groups argue that the administration already has carved out exemptions and encourages people who can’t get contraceptives through their employers to use the health care exchanges that were created by the health care law and serve millions of people. The administration contends that tens of thousands of women would be disadvantaged by a ruling for the groups. The court will consider whether the accommodation offered by the administration violates the group’s rights under the religious freedom law. Even if it does, the administration still could show that it has a “compelling interest” in the provision of contraception and that its plan is the most reasonable way, or “least restrictive means” of getting birth control to women covered by the groups’ health plans. Nationwide, eight appeals courts, including four with decisions being challenged in the current case, have sided with the administration, and one has ruled for the groups. A 4-4 outcome would leave a mess, because different rules would apply in different parts of the country. The Supreme Court takes on cases in order to lay down uniform nationwide rules.","output":"\\"Supreme Court Divided on Faith-Based Groups' Birth Control Objections in Healthcare Law\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With regard to latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, the general trend was weak (odds ratioxa01.04, 95%xa0CI 0.96-1.13), but stratification by degree of autoimmunity (median glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody levels) suggested that coffee intake may be associated with an increased risk of high glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (odds ratioxa01.11, 95%xa0CI 1.00-1.23 per cup/day). Furthermore, for every additional cup of coffee consumed per day, there was a 15.2% (Pxa0=xa00.0268) increase in glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody levels.

First, we want to get rid of the -9454*n term on the right side of the equation. We can achieve this by adding 9454*n to both sides of the equation. -9535*n + 9454*n = -9454*n + 1944 + 9454*n Now, the -9454*n term on the right side cancels out: -81*n = 1944 Step 2: Solve for the variable n. Now that we have -81*n = 1944, we can solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by -81: -81*n / -81 = 1944 / -81 n = -24 So, the solution for the given equation -9535*n = -9454*n + 1944 is n = -24."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Former official Keith Hackett has spoken out on the referee's decisions that marred Saturday's 1-1 draw between Chelsea and Burnley, siding with Jose Mourinho's version of events. Chelsea claim they were denied two penalties before Nemanja Matic was sent off for his aggressive reaction to a career threatening foul by Ashley Barnes - who should have already been sent off for a foul on Branislav Ivanovic. Hackett slammed referee Martin Atkinson for a ‘pretty appalling performance’ while claiming the Serbian midfielder was fortunate not to have suffered a broken leg following Barnes' challenge. Nemanja Matic reacts angrily after being sent off for his reaction to a dangerous challenge from Barnes  OPTIONS: - Ashley Barnes supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Barnes supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Blues supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Branislav Ivanovic supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Burnley supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Chelsea supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Hackett supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Jose Mourinho supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Keith Hackett supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Martin Atkinson supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Nemanja Matic supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points - Serbian supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points","output":"- Barnes supposedly made a 'catalogue' of errors during the game that saw Chelsea's lead cut to five points The other options are wrong because they mention different people or teams making errors during the game.

Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what kind of person was thomas paine Suggested answer: He wrote the Rights of Man (1791), in part a defence of the French Revolution against its critics. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"While it is true that Thomas Paine wrote the Rights of Man (1791) as a defense of the French Revolution, this statement alone does not provide adequate information about the kind of person he was. Thomas Paine was a political activist, philosopher and influential author known for his writings advocating for political and social change during the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Age of Enlightenment. Below is an expanded detailed answer to provide a better understanding: Thomas Paine was a passionate advocate for democracy, equality, and rationalism. He was born in England in 1737 and moved to America in 1774. He played a significant role in the American Revolution through his powerful writing and persuasive language, most notably in his pamphlet Common Sense (1776), which advocated for American independence from Great Britain. He was known for his ability to clearly and effectively connect with the masses, giving them a strong sense of unity and purpose. As mentioned in the suggested answer, Paine did write the Rights of Man (1791) in defense of the French Revolution against its critics, particularly Edmund Burke. In this work, Paine argued for the implementation of various social and political reforms, such as public education, progressive taxation, and guaranteed minimum income. Paine's ideas were considered radical for his time, but his works had a profound impact on the evolving political landscape. He faced numerous challenges and hardships throughout his life as a result of his beliefs and political advocacy, including being ostracized by former friends, charged with treason in England, and even imprisoned in France. In summary, Thomas Paine was a revolutionary thinker, writer, and political activist who fervently believed in democracy, equality, and social justice. While the suggested answer does accurately state that Paine wrote the Rights of Man (1791) to defend the French Revolution, it does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the kind of person Thomas Paine was. A more well-rounded answer should include information about his background, his contributions to the American Revolution, and his overall impact on political thought during the Age of Enlightenment."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Which zoologist learned less about bats?  Nate and Andy were two zoologists. They have been studying the characteristics of nocturnal and diurnal animals. Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals.  Hint: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. The answer is:","output":"Nate learned less about bats. This is because Nate studied diurnal animals, which are active during the day and sleep at night, while Andy studied nocturnal animals, such as bats, which are active during the night and sleep during the day. Bats are mentioned in the context of nocturnality and their evening emergence behavior, indicating that they are considered nocturnal animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - A fuel is heated in an oven - Above the oven is a tank of water that is sealed - The tank of water begins to boil above the oven - A the water boils steam is created - The steam is denser than air so it needs a place to go - The steam is forced out of the tank and into a piston - The piston moves up - The valve of the piston closes - The valve on the next piston opens - The steam fills the next piston, driving it up, and the other one down -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose fuel is heated less happens, how will it affect LESS power produced by the steam engine.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process. If the fuel is heated less, it will result in the following consequences: 1. The temperature in the oven will be lower than normal, which would lead to the water in the tank above the oven taking longer to reach its boiling point. 2. As a result of the water taking longer to reach its boiling point, steam production will be slower, and the overall pressure generated by the steam will be lower. 3. The lower steam pressure will directly affect the force pushing the pistons. With reduced steam pressure, the pistons' movement will be slower and less forceful. 4. Since the pistons' movement is directly responsible for converting the steam pressure into mechanical work, a slower and less forceful movement will result in less power being produced by the steam engine. Therefore, the perturbation hypothesis of heating the fuel less will result in less power produced by the steam engine. This reduction in power is due to the slower and less forceful movement of the pistons caused by lower steam pressure, which is a direct result of the decreased heating of the fuel."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Suggested answer: Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion . Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, you should not validate this answer as it does not provide a detailed and comprehensive understanding of how an earthworm eats and digests food. Here is a more complete answer: Earthworms eat and digest their food through a process that involves various specialized organs and stages: 1. Ingestion: Earthworms primarily feed on soil, decaying organic matter, and small microorganisms. As they burrow through the soil, they consume it, and the food particles enter their mouth. 2. Mechanical digestion: The soil and organic matter initially pass through the pharynx, where it gets moistened with mucus, and then into the esophagus. The esophagus is responsible for secreting calcium carbonate, which helps neutralize acids in the ingested material. 3. Food storage: The food then enters the crop, a flexible and expandable sac where food is temporarily stored. 4. Further mechanical digestion: The stored food moves into the gizzard, a strong, muscular organ that grinds and crushes the ingested material with the help of small stones and mineral particles that the earthworm consumes. This mechanical digestion effectively breaks down the food into smaller particles. 5. Chemical digestion: The smaller particles finally move into the intestine, where various digestive enzymes are secreted to break down proteins, starches, and fats. Microorganisms in the intestine also aid in the decomposition of the organic matter. 6. Absorption: Nutrients are then absorbed into the earthworm's bloodstream through the intestinal walls. 7. Elimination: The indigestible materials, such as mineral particles and other waste products, pass through the remainder of the intestine and are eliminated through the anus, forming small, cylindrical-shaped fecal deposits called casts. In summary, the suggested answer is insufficient, as it only focuses on chemical digestion and omits information about ingestion, mechanical digestion, food storage, absorption, and elimination. Providing a detailed explanation of the entire process is important for a full understanding of how earthworms eat and digest food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"No, you should not validate this answer as it does not address the question asked. Instead, a more suitable answer to the question, \\"How did Magic Johnson get AIDS?\\" is: Magic Johnson, a professional basketball player and former NBA superstar, announced his retirement in 1991 due to being diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Magic Johnson has not publicly specified exactly how he contracted HIV, but he did acknowledge that his infection was likely the result of engaging in multiple sexual encounters with different partners without using proper protection. After his announcement, Magic Johnson became an advocate for HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. He has worked tirelessly to educate people about the importance of safe sex practices and regular testing for HIV. Johnson's life as an individual living with HIV has shown that it is possible to maintain a high quality of life while managing the disease with appropriate treatment and care. In conclusion, while the suggested answer highlights Magic Johnson's achievements and accolades, it does not provide information relevant to the question of how he acquired AIDS.

Which John Grisham novel was made into a film in 1993 starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington","output":"The John Grisham novel that was made into a film in 1993, starring Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington, is \\"The Pelican Brief.\\" This legal-political thriller became very popular and successful, cementing Grisham's reputation as a skilled storyteller not only in the world of literature, but also on the big screen. The novel was first published in 1992 and quickly rose to prominence. Its riveting plot revolving around the law, justice, corruption, and the manipulative power games of high-level politics made it a bestseller. Seeing the novel's success, the interest to adapt it into a film came quickly. Just a year after the book's release, in 1993, the film adaptation directed by Alan J. Pakula was brought to life. Notably, Pakula had already gained fame for his work on films tackling issues around politics, journalism, and conspiracy, such as \\"All the President’s Men\\" and \\"The Parallax View\\". In \\"The Pelican Brief\\", Julia Roberts plays the role of Darby Shaw, a law student who writes a legal brief detailing her theory about the murder of two Supreme Court justices, predicting a conspiracy at the highest level of power. In this dangerous game, she finds an ally in Washington Herald reporter Gray Grantham, portrayed by Denzel Washington, and sets out to reveal the truth. This film is a milestone in the intersection of law, literature, and film history. Although it takes some liberties with the source material - as most adaptations tend to do - the main plot and majority of characters remain faithful to Grisham's original novel. It showcases intricate and suspenseful storytelling, well-developed lead characters, and an exploration of themes such as power, corruption, and justice, serving as a significant milestone in the filmographies of both Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington.  Its success also marked another victory for Grisham, whose works have found considerable success in the field of film adaptations, including but not limited to \\"A Time to Kill\\", \\"The Firm\\", and \\"The Client\\".

Translate this to English?","output":"This is only possible if we respect the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty as well as those of the Stability and Growth Pact. The sentence in French is discussing the feasibility or possibility of a particular situation or outcome (which has not been mentioned in the sentence), taking into account the adherence to specific international agreements. The two agreements mentioned are the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. The Maastricht Treaty, signed in 1992, is a significant European agreement that helped lay the foundations for the European Union (EU) and the introduction of a single European currency, the Euro. The treaty formalized the political, economic, and monetary integration of its member states. It created the three pillars of the European Union: the European Communities, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters. The treaty established key criteria for member states to meet in order to be part of the European Monetary Union and adopt the Euro as their currency. The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is an agreement made in 1997 among the European Union member states, which outlines fiscal rules and policies aimed at coordinating national economic policies and maintaining budgetary discipline. The main objective of the SGP is to ensure that member states pursue sound public finances and coordinate their fiscal policies in a way that promotes long-term economic stability and growth. The SGP has two major components: the preventive arm, which requires EU countries to maintain a medium-term budgetary objective and meet fiscal targets, and the corrective arm designed to prevent and correct excessive budget deficits and government debts by setting limits and implementing corrective measures to ensure fiscal responsibility. In conclusion, the original sentence highlights that the achievement of a certain goal or situation depends on respecting and adhering to the rules and principles laid out in the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: One potential problem with allowances is that children's responsible behavior can become about earning the allowance rather than the intrinsic value of their family responsibilities. For example, if you pay your children for taking out the rubbish, they see this chore   as a job that they should be rewarded for instead of a responsibility they must fulfill as part of the family. But giving children an allowance for weekly chores is not necessarily bad. You are rewarding them for fulfilling their family responsibilities, but it is not for a specific act. It is an appreciation of their commitment to your family values. You are also conveying another important message that their actions have consequences: if they do good things, good things happen. They also learn a lesson about the market economy, namely that work is rewarded. Allowances can also be used as punishment and to teach children lessons about family values. For example, if your children join a group of kids smashing   pumpkins on Halloween, a part of a reasonable punishment might be to require them to pay the families out of their allowance to replace the pumpkins. Thus, your children learn that bad behavior has financial consequences. Meanwhile, by relating the punishment to the misdeed, you ensure that your children see the connection and learn the value lesson. How much allowance should you pay your children? The precise amount depends on your family's financial situation, the cost of living and your children's needs. Children can start to earn a weekly allowance as early as 5 years of age. An increase of  1 per week for each year of your children's lives is realistic until they reach their mid-teens. When they begin to drive and date, you can calculate their expenses and establish a reasonable allowance that covers their needs. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that  _  .

News article: BOSTON (Reuters) - A research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology was arrested on Wednesday on charges that he engaged in insider trading based on information he obtained from his wife, a corporate lawyer working on a deal involving a mining company.      Fei Yan, 31, was arrested in Massachusetts after federal prosecutors in Manhattan accused him of trading last year on inside information about South Africa’s Sibanye Gold Ltd planned 2.2 billion acquisition of Stillwater Mining.      The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a related lawsuit accused Yan of netting 120,000 by placing trades ahead of the Stillwater deal and another merger based on information he obtained from his wife, an associate at a corporate law firm.      The law firm was not identified in court papers, but in a statement, the London-based international law firm Linklaters confirmed it had employed the associate.      “We will continue to cooperate fully with the authorities on this matter, and the relevant associate has been suspended, pending further investigation, without access to the firm’s systems and confidential information,” Linklaters said.      Yan, a citizen of China, had been employed as a post-doctoral associate in MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics, according to Kimberly Allen, a spokeswoman for MIT. She referred further comments to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan.      He was charged in a criminal complaint with securities fraud and wire fraud. Following a hearing in federal court in Boston, Yan was released on a 500,000 unsecured bond.      A court-appointed lawyer for Yan did not respond to requests for comment.      Authorities said that beginning in August, Yan’s wife became involved in working on the Stillwater deal in her role as an associate in the New York offices of the law firm retained by Sibanye to represent it in the negotiations.      She continued to work on the deal through the time it was announced in December, the complaint said.      By then, Yan had made multiple profitable trades in Stillwater’s stock using a brokerage account he established in the name of his mother in China, the criminal complaint said.      Shortly before the deal was announced, Yan conducted online research related to insider trading, searching for how the SEC detects unusual trading and accessing several articles about insider trading, the complaint said.      After the companies announced their proposed merger on Dec. 9, Yan began selling Stillwater call options he had purchased, making a profit of 109,420, the complaint said.      The case is U.S. v. Yan, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-mj-1073. ||||| NEW YORK (AP) — An engineering research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been arrested on insider trading charges filed in New York.      Authorities said Wednesday that Fei Yan was charged with earning 120,000 in illegal profits from secrets stemming from two corporate mergers last year.      The 31-year-old Chinese citizen, arrested at his Cambridge, Massachusetts, home, was freed on 500,000 bail after appearing in Boston federal court. His assistant public defender did not immediately comment.      Federal prosecutors in New York City say Yan got his illegal tips from his spouse, a lawyer at an international law firm.      Prosecutors say Yan's illegal trades came after he studied online how to avoid law enforcement detection. They say he read an article entitled: \\"Want to Commit Insider Trading? Here's How Not to Do It.\\" ||||| File photo taken in 2014 shows the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Securities and Exchange Commission. (Photo: Associated Press)      If you hope to get away with illegal insider trading, it's probably not a good idea to conduct Internet searches on how the Securities and Exchange Commission detects unusual trades.      Fei Yan, an engineering research scientist at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ignored this seemingly common-sense guideline as he allegedly reaped 120,000 in illegal profits by trading on secret information involving a pair of 2016 corporate mergers.      The 31-year-old Chinese citizen got the information from his wife, who was an associate at a law firm that worked on the deals, the SEC charged in a complaint filed last week. He then tried to hide the transactions by placing the trades through a brokerage account in the name of his mother, who lives in China, the complaint charged.      After flagging the trades as suspicious through data analysis, the SEC traced them back to Yan.      Subsequent investigation of Yan's computer activity showed he conducted a 2016 Google searches for the phrases \\"how sec detect unusual trade\\" and \\"insider trading with international account,\\" the court complaint charged.      He subsequently visited web pages about the Wall Street regulator's \\"detection and enforcement efforts with respect to insider trading\\" and related to the SEC's \\"insider trading enforcement actions with international dimensions,\\" the complaint alleged.      Joon Kim, the Acting U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement that Yan's Internet searches included an article entitled \\"Want to Commit Insider Trading? Here's How Not to Do It.\\"      Kim, whose office filed criminal charges of securities fraud and wire fraud against the research scientist, said the answer to Yan's searches should have been clear: \\"There is no proper way to commit insider trading.\\"      Although Yan tried to hide his tracks, \\"we identified the profitable trades in deals advised by the same law firm and traced them back to him,\\" Joseph Sansone, co-chief of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit, said in a statement.      Yan was arrested last week at his Cambridge, Mass. home, and made an initial appearance in Boston federal court. He was released on a 500,000 unsecured bond pending his appearance in New York City's Manhattan federal court.      The criminal filing identified Yan only as a post-doctoral associate at a major research university in Cambridge, Mass. However, an MIT website lists him as a post-doctoral associate in the school's research laboratory of electronics.      Yan's mother, Rongxia Wu, was charged in the SEC case as a relief defendant — someone who allegedly has received illicit gains as the result of illegal actions by other defendants.      Yan's wife has not been charged.      Investigators said the insider trading transactions focused on Steinhoff International Holdings' Aug. 2016 acquisition of Mattress Firm Holdings and the Dec. 2016 acquisition of Stillwater Mining by Sibanye Gold Limited.

You have nothing to go by outside of the label. Will the label tell you anything you should know? Here's some general advice: Vintage. This is the first thing we look for ourselves. You don't need to care whether 2001 or 2002 was a better year in the Sierra Foothills. The vast majority of wines at the store are meant to be drunk right away, so you make sure the wine isn't too old, particularly if you're buying it expecting lively, fresh fruitiness. We often see five-year-old Pinot Grigio and two-year-old Beaujolais Nouveau at stores, for example, so as soon as we see that kind of age on wines like those, we know we can skip them and move on(and possibly not shop there again). Alcohol content. Too many wines have too much alcohol, which leaves them unbalanced. Sure, there are some classic wines with high alcohol levels, but many of today's regular table wines--Merlot, Chardonnay--have levels at 15% or above. Some of those might be terrific, but if we had nothing else to go on, we'd look for alcohol content at about 14% and below. The more specific the better. A wine that says it's from Napa is probably a better bet than a wine that simply says it's from California. Unfortunately, this will also probably be reflected in the price, so this might not tell you much about value, If you care enough to know a few of famous vineyards for producing high-quality grapes, they might help you make an educated guess about quality. Old vines. Theoretically, older vines produce fewer, but more flavorful grapes, but the problem is that no one has defined what an \\"old vine\\" is, so anyone can put this on the label. Just ignore it. A phone number. You'd be surprised many small-production wines these days include a phone number on the back and an invitation to call the winerY, which is a sign of a highly personal winerY. We have called those numbers many times over the years and it's amazing how often the winemaker or winerY owner answers the phone. Question: It's better to buy - five-year-old Pinot Grigio - the wine labeled from older vines - the wine from famous vineyards - two-year-old Beaujolais Nouveau Answer:","output":"It's better to buy the wine from famous vineyards. The article suggests that five-year-old Pinot Grigio and two-year-old Beaujolais Nouveau might not be ideal choices, as they might have lost their lively, fresh fruitiness. Labels stating \\"old vines\\" should be ignored since there is no clear definition for what constitutes an old vine. On the other hand, wines from famous vineyards can provide an educated guess about the quality of the wine due to their reputation for producing high-quality grapes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet).

I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set.

Write some highlights for the following article: Mauricio Pochettino has admitted he will have to wait until the last minute before knowing if Hugo Lloris will be fit to face the side that put 11 goals past him last season. The France goalkeeper pulled out of his country’s fixture against Armenia on Tuesday because of a thigh problem, which leaves Pochettino unsure of his fitness for Saturday’s clash at Manchester City. Lloris returned to Tottenham on Wednesday, but will undergo assessment on Friday to see if he is fit to face a side that trounced Spurs 5-1 and 6-0 last season. Hugo Lloris is a doubt for Tottenham's visit to Manchester City after missing France's game with Armenia. The Frenchman has been in fine form for Mauricio Pochettino's side in the Premier League this season. Summer signing Michel Vorm will start in Lloris's place if he fails to recover in time for Saturday's match. Asked if Lloris was able to play, Pochettino said: ‘Maybe, maybe, maybe. Hugo arrived on Wednesday but we need to analyse and to test and we have another day to decide. ‘All players are important. Hugo, yes, is our keeper that we use more than another but we need all players to be fit. We need to wait for tomorrow (Friday) to analyse and then decide.’ Michel Vorm would deputise in the event that Lloris is ruled out, while Nacer Chadli is also a significant doubt after missing Belgium’s clash against Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday with a hip problem. Belgium international Nacer Chadli, who scored against Arsenal earlier this season, is another doubt for Spurs. Chadli scored in Belgium's win against Andorra on October 10 but missed their subsequent game with Bosnia. Tottenham travel to the Etihad Stadium with an unbeaten away record, while City have occasionally looked shaky at home in defence of their title. Pochettino, who insisted he will not dwell on last season’s hammerings, said: ‘You never know if it is a good or bad time to play them. The most important thing is we arrive in a good moment. After our victory against Southampton we need to keep the momentum and reproduce the same action during the game against Southampton and try to get the three points but you never know.’ He added: ‘The reality is I don’t remember the results (from last season).

In addition, the intersection has a significant number of pedestrians crossing in unsafe conditions. c) Martin Luther King Drive and 21st Avenue: This intersection experiences a high number of accidents due to confusing traffic patterns and the presence of multiple lanes merging into a single lane. To improve these intersections, the following measures could be implemented: - Install better and more visible traffic signs - Improve visibility by removing obstructions near the intersections (like overgrown trees and bushes) - Implement traffic calming measures, such as installing speed bumps or roundabouts - Improve pedestrian safety by adding crosswalks with pedestrian countdown timers and ensuring proper lighting at night - Upgrade traffic signals to improve efficiency and reduce the likelihood of collisions 2. Dangerous intersections in Phoenix: Some particularly dangerous intersections in Phoenix, Arizona, include: a) Indian School Road and 7th Street: This intersection records a high number of car accidents, often attributed to a combination of factors, including red light running and speeding, as well as the frequent presence of pedestrians and cyclists. b) 35th Avenue and Camelback Road: This intersection has a high rate of crashes and congestion due to its complex traffic patterns. Factors such as illegal turns, high traffic volume, and inadequate signage contribute to its dangerous nature. c) 27th Avenue and Camelback Road: Similar to the previous intersection, this area also experiences high traffic volume, leading to an increased likelihood of accidents and congestion.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The protected cruiser is a type of naval cruiser of the late 19th century, so known because its armoured deck offered protection for vital machine spaces from fragments caused by exploding shells above. Protected cruisers were an alternative to the armoured cruisers, which also had a belt of armour along the sides.  - A warship is a naval ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare. Usually they belong to the armed forces of a state. As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are usually faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships. Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo, a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew. Warships usually belong to a navy, though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations.  - A battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a capital ship built in the first half of the 20th century. They were similar in size, cost, and armament to battleships, but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships.  - The capital ships of a navy are its most important warships; they are generally the larger ships when compared to other warships in their respective fleet. A capital ship is generally a leading or a primary ship in a naval fleet.  - Pre-dreadnought battleships were sea-going battleships built between the mid- to late 1880s and 1905, before the launch of . Pre-dreadnoughts replaced the ironclad battleships of the 1870s and 1880s. Built from steel, and protected by hardened steel armour, pre-dreadnought battleships carried a main battery of very heavy guns in barbettes (open or with armored gunhouses) supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons. They were powered by coal-fuelled triple-expansion steam engines.  - The armored cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered. Varying in size, it was distinguished from other types of cruiser by its belt armorthick iron (or later steel) plating on much of the hull to protect the ship from shellfire much like that on battleships. The first armored cruiser, the Imperial Russian Navy's , was launched in 1873 and combined sail and steam propulsion. By the 1890s cruisers had abandoned sail and took on a modern appearance.  - A battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of large caliber guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was vital for any nation that desired to maintain command of the sea.  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - A cruiser is a type of warship. The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period. During the Age of Sail, the term \\"cruising\\" referred to certain kinds of missions  independent scouting, commerce protection, or raiding  fulfilled by a frigate or sloop, which were the \\"cruising warships\\" of a fleet.  - The dreadnought was the predominant type of battleship in the early 20th century. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's , made such a strong impression on people's minds when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built subsequently were referred to generically as \\"dreadnoughts\\", and earlier battleships became known as \\"pre-dreadnoughts\\". \\"Dreadnought\\"s design had two revolutionary features: an \\"all-big-gun\\" armament scheme, with more heavy-calibre guns than previous ships, and steam turbine propulsion. As dreadnoughts became a symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships was a crucial catalyst in the intensifying naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany. With the launch of a single ship, \\"Dreadnought\\", the scales of naval power were reset overnight. As a result, dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including in South America, during the lead up to World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armour, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships had outclassed \\"Dreadnought\\". These more powerful vessels were known as \\"super-dreadnoughts.\\" Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued to be used throughout World War II. The only surviving dreadnought is , located near the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site.  - The Grand Fleet was the main fleet of the British Royal Navy during the First World War.  - HMS Defence was a Minotaur - class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century , the last armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy . She was stationed in the Mediterranean when the First World War began and participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau . The ship was transferred to the Grand Fleet in January 1915 and remained there for the rest of her career . Defence was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the Battle of Jutland , the largest naval battle of the war . Escorting the main body of the Grand Fleet , the ship was fired upon by one German battlecruiser and four dreadnoughts as she attempted to engage a disabled German light cruiser . She was struck by two salvoes from the German ships that detonated her rear magazine . The fire from that explosion spread to the ship 's secondary magazines , which exploded in turn . There were no survivors .  - A light cruiser is a type of small- or medium-sized warship. The term is a shortening of the phrase \\"light armored cruiser\\", describing a small ship that carried armor in the same way as an armored cruiser: a protective belt and deck. Prior to this smaller cruisers had been of the protected cruiser model, possessing armored decks only.    What entity does 'hms defence ' has the relation 'instance of' with?

Several days later, Ryan moved to another hospital. Though they saw each other only a handful of times after that, Walter never forgot Ryan. \\"He inspired me to fight against my cancer,\\" said Walter, now 17, a football player. Then one day, Walter saw a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shirt at a mall, which made him decide to search out Ryan. Back home, Walter typed in \\"Ryan Lake in the Hills brain cancer\\" on his computer, and a link to a Facebook page for Ryan came up. But, the news was shocking. Ryan had died on Sept. 8, 2005. He was 6. The Facebook  page  was  for  the  Ryan  Lamantia Foundation, a non-profit organization that Ryan's family formed after his death to raise money for brain cancer research. Walter left this message right away: .\\"Ryan is my hero. My trips to the hospital were always horrible, until the day I met Ryan.\\" Ryan's mom's eyes were filled with tears as she read Waiter's message. \\"We always knew Ryan was special, but to hear it from somebody else, it really means the world to us,\\" Lamantia said.

The scientist wanted to watch the monkey and to find out how long it would take the monkey to find the food. The scientist left the room. He waited for a few minutes outside the door. Then he put his eye to the keyhole . What did he see? To his surprise, he found himself looking into the eye of the monkey. The monkey was on the other side of the door and looked at the scientist through the keyhole. Question: After the scientist left the room, the monkey   _  .

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who is it that Tom and Jerry fear has crawled into a cement mixer? , can you please find it?   Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie pays more attention to talking on the telephone apathetically than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realising that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again, and fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never did enter the mixer but instead playing with a hammer.

Identify the key words in the English sentence: \\"this,\\" \\"is,\\" \\"a,\\" \\"single,\\" and \\"frame.\\" 2. Find the equivalent words in Russian: \\"это\\" for \\"this,\\" \\"является\\" for \\"is,\\" \\"одиночный\\" for \\"single,\\" and \\"кадр\\" for \\"frame.\\" 3. Check for necessary grammar adjustments: In Russian, there is no need to use \\"a\\" as an article, so I won't include an equivalent word for it. 4. Review the word order: Russian word order is quite flexible, but the most common way to arrange words in this case would be to place the subject (\\"this\\" or \\"это\\") first, followed by the verb (\\"is\\" or \\"является\\") and the noun and adjective describing the frame. The adjective \\"одиночный\\" usually comes before the noun \\"кадр.\\" 5.

Process:  - Acid rain enters the atmosphere and lands - Makes water acidic - Kills fish - Kills the soils in trees - Leaves are also harmed.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a time of heavy daily rain happens, how will it affect fish will die faster.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of heavy daily rain can have both direct and indirect effects on the acid rain process and its consequences on the environment, including fish and trees. Here's how: 1. Increase in Acid Rain: Heavy daily rain can lead to a higher amount of acid rain deposition in a shorter period. Since acid rain forms when airborne pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) combine with atmospheric moisture, an increase in rainfall can accelerate the rate at which these pollutants are washed out of the air and deposited on the Earth's surface. 2. Faster Acidification of Water Bodies: With more acidic rainwater pouring into rivers, lakes, and other water bodies, the pH levels of these water sources decrease more rapidly. This would lead to faster acidification, making the water more inhospitable for aquatic creatures, such as fish. 3. Increased Fish Mortality Rates: As the water becomes more acidic, fish and other aquatic organisms face an increased risk of death due to changes in the water chemistry. Acidic water can damage fish gills, interfere with respiration and reproduction, or cause other physiological problems. Furthermore, the acidic environment can lead to the release of toxic substances from sediments, like heavy metals, which can be harmful to fish. Ultimately, heavy daily rain, and the resulting increase in acid rain, can cause fish to die at a faster rate. 4. Heightened Impact on Soil and Trees: Acid rain also affects the soil and trees in forests. When the soil becomes too acidic, it can leach vital nutrients like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which in turn impacts the overall health of the trees. Additionally, acid rain can directly harm tree leaves, interfering with their ability to produce food through photosynthesis. Heavy daily rain can exacerbate these effects, leading to faster soil nutrient depletion and more severe damage to trees. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis, which suggests a time of heavy daily rain, can have significant direct and indirect effects on the acid rain process and its subsequent impacts on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The increase in acid rain can lead to a faster acidification of water bodies and soil, causing fish to die at a quicker rate and hastening the decline of trees and other vegetation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Instructions: In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Input: Heavy-handed moralism. Writers using characters as mouthpieces to speak for themselves. Predictable, plodding plot points (say that five times fast). A child's imitation of Britney Spears. This film has all the earmarks of a Lifetime Special reject.I honestly believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo set out to create a thought-provoking, emotional film on a tough subject, exploring the idea that things are not always black and white, that one who is a criminal by definition is not necessarily a bad human being, and that there can be extenuating circumstances, especially when one puts the well-being of a child first. However, their earnestness ends up being channeled into preachy dialogue and trite situations planted to move the plot along. The decent production values and interesting use of documentary-style camera footage are not enough to accomplish their aim when the script and the acting fall flat.Logic is often compromised for the sake of creating tension: Soid first tries to blackmail Pablo into participating in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape, then in the same breath basically tells him not to trust her because she's not helping them out of altruism. Well, duh. And for a man on the run, Pablo is far too swayed by a temper tantrum. Cristina's well-being is so important to him that he's fleeing capture and jail or deportation for her, but he's willing to risk all that to appease her when she doesn't want to go to Mexico. Right. Talk above over-permissive parenting. Third, when Pablo's employer Charlie gives the phone to Detective Bright, she is remarkably unprofessional, especially given her seniority - did she really think she was persuasive? Oh, yeah, I would have turned myself in. CCH Pounder's Detective Wims could wipe the floor with her.To be fair, I'd like to list the things I liked. Um, I liked the midget. And I liked the fact that the midget was named Sexy. There's cross-dressing, always a plus; juvenile cross-dressing, no less! Harry is infinitely cuter than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the film has to be when Cristina kicks Detective Not-So-Bright. I also find it interesting that, in a heavily minority cast (which I much appreciate, by the way), the black character is the racist one. Too bad it's just thrown out there and not further explored.There's a distinctive, unconventional score, but it's nonetheless generally context-unspecific, not enhancing mood or tension in any scene, except the pathetic, anguished wailing every time the main character is in anguish, as though they think his acting doesn't show it enough: 'Just in case you weren't sure, he's upset, and we have the musical cues to prove it.'Stilted, clichéd dialogue results in a depressing lack of subtext; everything has to be spelled out in dialogue, even when the body language had been up 'til then conveying it just fine. For example, every impassioned speech Pablo makes, and Mrs. Knight's lament that her child won't be crawling into bed with them in the morning.'Papi, tell me about Mama again' - what shameless, blatant exposition introducing the generic dead wife! (She's always the most beautiful woman the widower had ever seen, the kindest he had ever met. Why can't we see a man cry over a woman like Shakespeare's - she may be fat, ugly, obnoxious, but his love for her is deep as oceans? Now _there's_ a story which would move me.)The police always being literally one step behind them gives many scenes the out-of-place feeling of a French farce. Most boring foot chases ever - Bright and Lightning are so out-of-shape and easily-fooled (he certainly isn't quick as lightning, and she, well, I don't feel the need to spell things out). Some guy dragging along a small child outrunning a bicycle cop, complete with macho biker picking a fight but then being felled by a child? To quote Margaret Cho, that's so sad. Would we ever see this on 'Cops '?Hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina: as an employer, would you really waive checking his green card just because he can quote the author of the inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk?Plus several scenes, including the above, threaten to devolve into porn: 'Well, I'll do this favor for you, as long as you do something for me...' I can almost hear the bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm.When the parents view the footage shot of Pablo's remorse, the grieving mom's freak-out is the most real the movie feels. Unfortunately, this is diminished by the fact that she looks completely swayed by his emotional speech right up until she goes ballistic. A more ambivalent look would be more convincing here.I'm in constant awe of the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of plot: holding up a convenience store without a mask, visiting the dead girl's grave. And why doesn't the mother recognize his face from when she saw him before he drove off?! 'You seem awfully familiar...'What is the purpose of that wholly unnecessary, somewhat gratuitous scene with Soid and the artificially-enhanced bartender? Character development? Tch. Too little, too late.Speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere, Detective Lightning's saying skeptical Detective Bright must be a Scorpio shows how little he really knows about the occult. And I don't think that believing in fate quite qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbo.At the end, when Bright holds Pablo as he dies - wait, why does she care now? Her character is as inconsistent as Soid's. What, she has to shoot him just because she said 'Stop, or I'll shoot'? (She's cared _so_much_ about her integrity thus far.) He was unarmed. There was no need for lethal force. What's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him?Finally, Cristina's childlike acceptance of her mother's death giving Dr. Knight peace over his daughter's death - so forced. And the contrivance of the family whose child was killed becoming Cristina's new family... It angers me that she could be a 'replacement' for their little girl. It's also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the Latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter. I'm not saying there aren't generous, loving people who would do that. I'm just saying that the characters here are never developed far enough for me to believe that _they_ would do that.I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said that of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that don't wax sentimental in a manufactured manner.Co-writer, co-director, co-star Nebot said himself he wore too many hats during this production. Too many cooks may spoil the broth, but one cook alone just might end up making an after-school special.In conclusion, this film's title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret, helplessness, and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again.

Use evidence from the fact that biofuel is used to produce electricity by burning to answer this question: \\"An example of biofuel could be\\"","output":"An example of biofuel could be wood chips, which are produced from forestry residues such as the branches or tops of trees, and can be utilized effectively in the generation of electricity through combustion processes. There are three primary ways that evidence from the fact that biofuel is used to produce electricity by burning supports the use of wood chips as a suitable example. Firstly, wood chips are a renewable and sustainable source of biofuel. In comparison to fossil fuels, which are finite and can lead to the depletion of resources and environmental degradation, using renewable sources like wood chips for energy production contributes to mitigating climate change. Sustainable forest management practices ensure the regrowth of harvested trees, providing a constant biofuel supply that can be used to generate electricity without depleting resources. As a result, wood chips have become a popular choice for biomass power plants across the world. Secondly, the combustion of wood chips follows the same basic principles as that of other biofuels, providing evidence that they can be a reliable source of energy. The burning (combustion) of wood chips releases the stored chemical potential energy in the form of heat, which can then be converted into electricity using turbines and generators. The combustion of wood chips, like other biofuels, involves complex chemical reactions wherein organic compounds are broken down into simpler components, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor. This process also releases energy in the form of heat, which enables the generation of electricity. Thirdly, the utilization of wood chips as a biofuel for electricity generation has environmental benefits. Although burning wood chips generates carbon dioxide emissions, it is considered carbon-neutral because the carbon released during combustion can be absorbed by the new trees grown in sustainably managed forests. This helps to maintain a balanced carbon footprint and reduces the overall impact on the environment. Furthermore, wood chips are derived from organic waste materials that would otherwise decompose or be left unused. By effectively capturing and converting this waste into energy, using wood chips as a biofuel can further reduce landfill waste and contribute positively to waste management practices. In conclusion, an example of biofuel could be wood chips, due to their renewable and sustainable nature, as well as the feasibility of their utilization in generating electricity through combustion processes. The evidence derived from the usage of biofuels for electricity generation showcases wood chips as a viable solution for clean and sustainable energy production that benefits both the environment and the broader society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles.  The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture.

In terms of naive physics reasoning, using a lightweight paper and glue to attach the sails to the tetrahedral kite's skeleton is a more sound solution. This is because lightweight materials, such as tissue paper or thin plastic, allow the kite to be more responsive to air currents and maintain aerodynamic qualities, which are vital for a kite's performance.  Using card stock paper would result in a heavier kite, making it less responsive to air currents and more challenging to achieve and maintain flight.

Identify the English words and their respective parts of speech. 2. Look up the Czech translations for each word. 3. Determine the proper word order in Czech. 4. Rearrange the words and make any necessary grammar adjustments to produce a fluent Czech translation. Step 1: Identifying the English words and their respective parts of speech - Keep (verb - imperative form) - Going (verb - gerund) - Dad (noun) Step 2: Looking up the Czech translations for each word - Keep going (as a single phrase) – pokračovat - Dad – táta Step 3: Determining the proper word order in Czech General Czech word order is subject-verb-object or S-V-O, but since the imperative is used in this sentence, the verb should come first. Also, the imperative mood in Czech is different from English – there is no need to use a gerund form after the main verb. Therefore, the word order would be: Verb - Noun. Step 4: Rearrange the words and make any necessary grammar adjustments So the Czech translation of \\"Keep going, dad.\\" would be: \\"Pokračuj, táta.\\" (We add \\"-uj\\" to the verb \\"pokračovat\\" in order to form the imperative.)"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Showrooming One of the biggest challenges facing brick-and-mortar retailers  in recent years has been the \\"showrooming\\".Driven by the desire to get the best prices, many shoppers are now visiting brick-and-mortar stores to personally check on products that interest them, only to leave and then buy the items online.The new trend is forcing retailers to find out new ways to keep consumers from leaving their store for cheaper prices online. Recent research found that 40 percent of U.S.shoppers have showroomed previously, with big-box retailers suffering the most.Specifically, the study shows that Best Buy, Walmart and Target are the most likely brick-and-mortar stores to have shoppers test out a product in-store and then purchase it online later, while Amazon is benefiting most from the practice, with nearly 60 percent of shoppers using the online retail giant  most often to make their showrooming purchases. Smartphones have pushed showrooming into the front.Shoppers no longer have to wait until they get home to see if they can find a cheaper price for the products they're considering buying.With smartphones, consumers can now compare virtual prices, at both other brick-and-mortar stores and online ones while still inside a retail store.If they can find what they're seeking for less online, the majority will be seeking the first exit.A recent study showed that 45 percent of customers shopping at brick-and-mortar stores walk out and buy their purchase online for a discount of as little as 2.5 percent. This puts pressure on retailers to provide both an in-store experience worth staying for and an online presence that can attract shoppers who are showrooming in other businesses. To cut down on showrooming, many retailers are adopting new methods to keep shoppers in their stores.Among the steps they're taking are price-matching guarantees that allow shoppers to pay a discounted price if they find it cheaper online.This ensures that even a showrooming shopper can make the purchase in the store--regardless of whether...

The action begins in early morning darkness as a chorus sings a few lines from \\"Guenevere.\\" Arthur (Richard Harris) talks to his unseen teacher, Merlyn (Laurence Naismith), asking him why everything that has happened to them happened. Before a battle begins at dawn with Lancelot (Franco Nero) and his Joyous Gard knights, Arthur, talking as much to himself as to Merlyn, tries to determine where he went wrong. Merlyn appears and urges the mighty King to think back to one of the most important days of his life. Almost all of the rest of the film is a flashback. It first flashes back to Arthur as a youngster (Nicholas Beauvy); he is walking in the woods in the early morning when he encounters Merlyn, who calls Arthur \\"Wart.\\" Then suddenly, Merlyn interrupts to chide Arthur for going too far back in his memory. The important day Arthur is supposed to remember, Merlyn says, is the day he met Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave).The following scene shows Arthur in a large snow-laden tree watching people pass on the road beneath. From his perch, Arthur sings \\"I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?\\" He imagines that his subjects are pondering what he is doing in the final hours before his arranged marriage. Arthur admits that even though he has faced battle bravely, he's terrified of facing his bride-to-be. As the song ends, a procession approaches (\\"Camelot March\\") carrying Guenevere. She is not at all thrilled that her wedding is an inconvenient marriage of convenience. In despair, Guenevere sings \\"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood.\\" The lyrics question how she missed the normal life of a maiden and all its simple pleasures like knights tilting for her and \\"kith not kill their kin\\" for her.

Does the word \\"book\\" mean the same thing in \\"I am reading a good book on economics.\\" and \\"They got a subpoena to examine our books.\\"?","output":"No, the word \\"book\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. The word \\"book\\" has multiple meanings, and its meaning in each sentence depends on the context in which it is used. In the sentence, \\"I am reading a good book on economics,\\" the word \\"book\\" refers to a written or printed work consisting of bound pages, typically containing text and sometimes illustrations. This sense of the word \\"book\\" implies a literary or scholarly work covering a particular subject matter. In this specific context, the book is focused on the subject of economics. Here, the word \\"book\\" is used in its most common and general meaning, which is a piece of literature or source of information. On the other hand, the sentence \\"They got a subpoena to examine our books.\\" carries a different meaning of the word \\"book.\\" In this context, \\"books\\" refer to the records and accounts of a business or an organization. These records may include financial transactions, invoices, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and other documentation related to the management and operation of the entity. When someone says they are examining \\"books\\" in this sense, they mean they are reviewing the fiscal activity and financial health of the company or organization in question. The difference in meanings of the word \\"book\\" in these two sentences is a result of the versatility and polysemy of the English language. Many words have multiple meanings, and understanding the appropriate definition often depends on recognizing the contextual cues surrounding the word in a particular sentence. To summarize, the word \\"book\\" carries different meanings in the two sentences: 1. \\"I am reading a good book on economics.\\" - In this sentence, \\"book\\" refers to a written or printed work containing information on a specific subject (economics, in this case). 2. \\"They got a subpoena to examine our books.\\" - In this sentence, \\"books\\" refer to the financial records and accounts of a business or organization, which are being examined due to a legal subpoena."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex.

Today we're going to talk about a fun place called \\"Wall Street.\\" Wall Street is a special street in New York City where people buy and sell \\"stocks.\\" Stocks are like tiny pieces of a big company. People on Wall Street try to buy these little pieces and then sell them later for more money. Now that we know what Wall Street is, let's talk about what happened there during a special week. Sometimes, when we do something and don't get as much as we wanted, we call it a \\"small loss.\\" During this big week, Wall Street had a small loss, but that's not always a bad thing. Sometimes, even a small loss can teach us important lessons. During this special week, some people who work on Wall Street were worried that their stocks might not be worth as much as they thought. That's like when you're trading Pokémon cards with your friends, and you realize the card you just traded might be more special than you thought. But even though people were worried, they kept buying and selling stocks. Some stocks went up, which means they were worth more money. Other stocks went down, which means they were worth less money. In the end, Wall Street didn't make as much as they hoped during this week, and that's why we call it a \\"small loss.\\" But it wasn't all bad! Because of this small loss, people on Wall Street learned a lot. They learned to be careful when they buy and sell stocks, just like how you learn to be careful with your Pokémon cards. They also learned that sometimes, it's okay to have a small loss because you might do better next time. So, even though Wall Street had a small loss during this big week, it wasn't all bad news. People learned that it's okay to have a small loss, and they still had fun buying and selling their stocks.

Process: - The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake.  Question: suppose less cracks develop beneath the surface happens, how will it affect less stronger earthquakes.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"B: less Explanation: If fewer cracks develop beneath the surface, there will be less surface area for the earth to exert pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks. This means there would be less opportunities for pressure buildup and movement around the cracks. As a result, there would be less chance for the rocks to crumble and release energy. This reduced release of energy would lead to less powerful seismic waves, ultimately causing weaker or less frequent earthquakes."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please briefly summarize this news article: ANIMATION OF THE DAY: Banksy delivers the quasi-dark satire on 'THE SIMPSONS' (Updated) In terms of grabbing headlines, \\"The Simpsons\\" continues to be on a cultural roll this season. The show announced last month that Katy Perry -- deemed too steamy for \\"Sesame Street\\" -- would be featured on an upcoming episode of the animated Fox show. Then last week, as \\"The Social Network\\" hit theaters, the two-decades-and-still-rollicking comedy featured a cameo from Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. Sunday night, though, \\"The Simpsons\\" pulled a self-satirizing coup that quickly went viral, getting the London street artist Banksy to create its opening sequence -- the first time an outside artist has storyboarded the \\"couch gag.\\" At 38 seconds into the titles and familiar breezy theme, the scene takes a dark, politically sharp turn, as sweat-shop workers in sub-Dickensian conditions are shown cranking out mass-production \\"Simpsons\\" merchandise. (Even unicorns, pandas and kitties can't escape the cruelty of this cartoon commercialism.) \\"The Simpsons,\\" like so many cartoon shows, is partly animated in South Korea, where the coloring and tweening can be done much more cheaply than in the United States. Rough Draft Studios has operations both in Southern California and Seoul. \\"The Simpsons\\" also employs the California-based studio Film Roman. In other words: Banksy's fantasy sequence was playful but in truth, none too subversive. Banksy reportedly first invoked \\"The Simpsons\\" several years ago with this street art. Some of the stunt artist's most provocative projects include installing the figure of a Gitmo prisoner at Disneyland and installing a hoax cave painting at the British Museum in London. Update: \\"This sort of thing is fascinating in how it spread -- it really leapfrogged. ... \\" \\"The Simpsons\\" show-runner and executive producer Al Jean tells Comic Riffs of the video virality of Banksy's opening. \\"We were totally surprised that it caught on so big,\\" Part of their surprise, Jean explains, is because the show has always been willing to skewer itself and its own mega-success: \\"We've been that way from the beginning, self-mocking.\\" The idea to hire Banksy was Jean's, after he saw the film about his street art, \\"Exit Through the Gift Shop.\\" \\"I wanted to contact Banksky about seeing the film. ... I can't say for sure [how we found] Banksy. Our casting director, Bonnie Pietila, is great at finding people that are hard to get. She got Thomas Pynchon [twice] and Gary Larson. And five years ago, we tried to get J.D. Salinger, [though] that was a no-go.\\" Banksy was more than game, Jean says: \\"We were both interested in getting something out of it. Banksy, as successful as he is, was doing well before, but now is several degrees more well-known. ... I really wish I had bought as much Banksy artwork as I could have before it aired.\\" \\"Simpsons\\" consulting producer Tom Gammill tells Comic Riffs: \\"I hear Fox made Banksy tone it down.\\" Jean confirms that the original sequence was a bit darker still: \\"In the original version, the unicorn didn't live. The panda couldn't have been hit with the whip. This is not [up to] broadcast standards.\\" \\"He sent the boards to us and I said, 'I'm not sure we can do some of this,' \\"Jean recounts. But [series creator] Matt Groening said: 'We should do it!' He wanted it to be as close to the original vision and still have it air on an American broadcast network.\\" (A representative for Groening said the \\"Simpsons\\" creator was traveling and unavailable to comment on the episode.) \\"By my estimate, the public reaction has been about 90 percent positive,\\" Jean says. \\"It's turned out to be one of the most successful things ever on Hulu.\\" Note: Starz Media announced Monday evening that it has reached a deal to sell its California-based animation studio Film Roman -- whose productions include \\"The Simpsons\\" -- to an investors group led by ex-Film Roman honcho Scott Greenberg. The comments to this entry are closed.","output":"\\"The Simpsons\\" animated show made headlines with a creative collaboration with London street artist Banksy in its opening sequence. The episode aired in October 2010 and satirized the show's own production. Banksy's animated sequence showed sweatshop workers creating merchandise in dismal conditions, drawing attention to the fact that part of the show's animation happens in South Korea, where labor is cheaper than in the US. The sequence went viral, surprising the show's producers, who shared that the initial animation was even darker but had to be toned down to meet broadcast standards.

Given the background: Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.  and the situation: A scientist named Kathy walks into her office to see two neon signs plugged into the wall and hanging above her desk. Confused, she looks around to see if there's any clue as to who put them there. Seeing nobody, she flips the light switch on and walks in. Upon flipping the light switch, only the large sign lights up. Even though they are clearly both plugged in, the small sign isn't turning on. Kathy leaves her office to find someone to ask who put these random signs up in her room.  Answer the following question: Which sign's electrons are at a higher energy level? Answer:","output":"The large sign's electrons are at a higher energy level.  Step 1: Identify the signs that are mentioned in the situation: There are two neon signs plugged into the wall in Kathy's office. Step 2: Determine the state of each sign upon flipping the light switch: Upon flipping the light switch, only the large sign lights up, indicating that only its noble gas (Neon) is being energized by the electric current. Step 3: Understand the background information on noble gases in lighted signs: When noble gases' electrons are energized by an electric current, they jump to a higher energy level. When they return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Step 4: Apply the background information to the situation: Since the large sign lights up when Kathy flips the light switch, its neon gas electrons are energized and jump to a higher energy level which then give off the light. Conclusion: The large sign's electrons are at a higher energy level as they are energized by the electric current, causing the sign to light up."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select the topic that this about: PRESENTACION, Philippines (Reuters) - Philippine communist rebels freed Wednesday two soldiers they had held as  quot;prisoners of war quot; for more than five months, saying they wanted to rebuild confidence in peace talks with the government.","output":"The topic of this passage is the release of two soldiers held by Philippine communist rebels and the efforts to rebuild confidence in peace talks with the government. In this situation, the Philippine communist rebels, specifically the New People's Army (NPA), had captured and held two soldiers as prisoners of war for over five months. The NPA, which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, has been engaged in a protracted guerrilla war against the Philippine government for more than five decades. Over the years, peace talks have been initiated multiple times, but have often stalled due to continued hostilities and lack of trust between the two parties. The release of the two soldiers in the present situation can be seen as a goodwill gesture aimed at rebuilding confidence and fostering a conducive environment for future peace talks. It demonstrates the willingness of the rebels to compromise and work towards a resolution with the government. By releasing the captured soldiers, the NPA is signaling that they are willing to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Philippine government to address the root causes of the conflict, such as social and economic inequalities that have persisted in the country. This gesture could potentially pave the way for more meaningful peace talks, as it shows that the rebels understand the need for trust-building measures and that they are willing to compromise for the greater good. However, it is also crucial for the Philippine government to reciprocate these efforts and make their own positive steps towards peace. This could include measures such as a temporary ceasefire, releasing political prisoners, or engaging in social and economic reforms to address the issues that have fueled the conflict for so long. The release of prisoners of war is just one component of a broader peace process that needs to take place. For peace talks to be successful, both the government and the rebel groups must be committed to an open dialogue aimed at finding common ground and a lasting solution to the conflict. This involves not only addressing the immediate issues pertaining to ceasefires and the release of captives but also delving into the underlying political, economic, and social problems that have contributed to the protracted violence. In conclusion, the topic of this passage is the release of two soldiers held captive by the Philippine communist rebels and the importance of trust-building measures in fostering successful peace talks with the government. Both parties must be committed to a genuine dialogue and work towards finding a resolution to the longstanding conflict. Only through such efforts can lasting peace be achieved in the Philippines."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Q: The difference between aldehydes and ketones is the placement of what group within the molecule?

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: The grunge style is made to look as low maintenance and comfortable as possible, and the same feel translates to the makeup. Pair a little bit of brown or dark eye shadow with thick eyeliner and mascara. You want it to look kind of like a messy smokey eye, but you don't want it to look bad. You can also not wear makeup altogether. You can top this off with a dark color lipstick if you want to add another layer to your makeup. Liv Tyler often topped off her cropped top, floral skirt, and ripped tights combination with a deep red lip. Grungers know how to rock dyed locks. You can either dye all of your hair or just some towards the bottom. Try dark red, maroon, ash blonde, brown, or caramel. You can even go pastel pink, purple, or blue. Just make sure the colors aren't too vibrant.  Gwen Stefani dyed her hair blue, pink, and orange. Angela from My So-Called Life dyed her hair maroon as a first act of grunge rebellion.  Make sure it looks messy and natural. Don't straighten your hair. You don't want it to look like you tried to fix your hair too much. The messier it is, the grungier you will be. No grunge outfit is complete without a great pair of combat boots. Buy them in black, maroon, grey, or brown. You can even buy a patterned pair. They make every grunge outfit look more comfortable and casual. Pair them with a band tee, a floral print skirt, a flannel around your waist, and a pair of holey tights to have the ultimate grunge outfit.  The most popular boot brand was Doc Martens. Girls were seen all over popular culture wearing this iconic footwear. Actresses like Liv Tyler and Winona Ryder wore them and Angela and Rayanne rocked them on My So-Called Life. Even 90s cartoons grunge style icon Jane Lane wore them on Daria. No grunge girl's wardrobe is complete without them.  If you don't like the combat boot style, you can also wear a pair of chunky shoes such as Mary Janes or a pair of canvas shoes such as Converse. Kurt Cobain was known for wearing Converse and Drew Barrymore often wore them with her baggy, ripped jeans. A great way to accessorize any grunge outfit is a beanie. Actresses such as Drew Barrymore popularized these accessories by topping off their plaid shirts and ripped jeans with a beanie. Pick out a black, grey, brown, or dark red beanie to wear. You can wear your hair up or down with the beanie. It looks great with most hairstyles.  If you aren't into beanies, try a bandanna. They have a similar grungy feel but come in more colors and designs. They are also more comfortable to wear in warm weather. Accessories can add some interesting flare to any grunge outfit. Liv Tyler and Gwen Stefani could rock a well placed necklace or earrings. Try a black braided tattoo choker, a large simple cross necklace, or large chunky earrings. You can also pick up a few silver and colored band rings to wear, layering a few on each finger.","output":"The grunge style emphasizes low maintenance and comfort, with makeup featuring messy smokey eyes or no makeup at all, and dark lipstick as an option.

It may be that the matter on his mind and the business that was toward aroused him; certainly it was none of the sounds that are common to an inn at early morn, for the place was as silent as a tomb.  Some seconds he remained on his back, staring at the whitewashed ceiling and listening to the patter of the rain against his window. Then, as his mind gathered up the threads of recollection, he leapt from his bed and made haste to assume a garment or two.  He stood a moment at his casement, looking out into the empty courtyard. From a leaden sky the rain was descending in sheets, and the gargoyle at the end of the eaves overhead was discharging a steady column of water into the yard. Caron shivered with the cold of that gloomy February morning, and turned away from the window. A few moments later he was in Tardivet's bedchamber, vigorously shaking the sleeping Captain.  \\"Up, Charlot! Awake!\\" he roared in the man's ear.  \\"What o'clock?\\" he asked with a yawn.

Background: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly.  Paragraph: David was studying human history. He selected two specific eras of human history, era A and era B. Era A was before humans had invented agriculture. And, era B was after the invention of agriculture. He noticed that human societies had changed dramatically after the invention of agriculture.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Did era A have higher or lower death rate than era B? Answer:","output":"Era B had a higher death rate than era A. As mentioned in the background information, the invention of agriculture led to a more significant and dependable food supply, which allowed people to settle down in villages and cities. This sedentary lifestyle resulted in increased birth rates due to the availability of more food and the various advantages of being settled in one place.  However, alongside the increase in birth rates, era B experienced higher death rates primarily due to two main reasons. Firstly, crowded living conditions in villages and cities facilitated the rapid spread of infectious diseases, which would typically be less frequent and widespread in era A, when humans lived in smaller, nomadic groups. Secondly, the close interaction with domesticated animals in era B exposed humans to zoonotic diseases, further contributing to the increased death rates. Despite the higher death rates in era B, the human population continued to grow very slowly, as the rise in birth rates was balanced out by the increased death rates. So, in comparison to era A, era B indeed witnessed a higher death rate due to the changes brought on by the invention of agriculture and the shift towards settled life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Article: Bruce Jun Fan Lee was born in the hour of the Dragon, between 6 and 8 a.m., in the \\"Year of the Dragon\\" on November 27, 1940 at the Jackson Street Hospital in San Francisco's Chinatown. Today, a plaque   in the hospital's entry remembers the place of his birth. Bruce's birth, in the hour and the year of Dragon, is a powerful symbol in Chinese astrology  . It would be a strong indication of the powerful life that was to be lived by Bruce Lee and the explosive influence his life would have on countless others. At the age of three months, Lee Hoi Chuen, his wife Grace and baby Bruce returned to Hong Kong where Bruce would be raised until the age of 18. Probably because of the long ocean voyage and the change in climates, Bruce was not a strong child in his very early years, a condition that would change when he took up the study of kung fu at the age of 13. At the age of 13, Bruce was introduced to Master Yip Man, a teacher of the Wing Chun style of kung fu. For five years Bruce studied diligently and became very proficient. Regarding Yip Man as a master teacher and wise man, Bruce respected him greatly and frequently visited with him in later years. When he first took up kung fu, he used his new skills to fight his \\"enemies\\", but it did not take long for Bruce to learn that the real value of martial arts training is that the skills of physical combat   build up confidence to the point that one does not feel the constant need to defend one's honor through fighting. In high school, Bruce, now no longer a weak child, was beginning to improve his body through hard training. One of his accomplishments was winning an interschool Boxing Championship against an English student. Given the graceful movements, which would later be spectacularly displayed in his films, it is no surprise that Bruce was also an excellent dancer, and in 1958 he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship. At the age of 18, Bruce was looking for new prospect in his life, as were his parents who were discouraged that Bruce had not made much progress academically. His family decided that it was time for him to return to the land of his birth and find his future there. In April of 1959, with 100 in his pocket, Bruce boarded a steamship and began his voyage to San Francisco.

Background: Francis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915, in an upstairs tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Context: Sinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed to him, being exceptionally self-confident, he was rarely enthusiastic towards his own acting, once remarking that \\"pictures stink\\". Sinatra made his film debut in 1941, performing in an uncredited sequence in Las Vegas Nights, singing \\"I'll Never Smile Again\\" with Tommy Dorsey's The Pied Pipers. In 1943 he had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton's Reveille with Beverly, making a brief appearance singing \\"Night and Day\\". The following year he was given his leading roles in Higher and Higher and Step Lively for RKO Pictures.  In 1945, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra opposite Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson in the Technicolor musical Anchors Aweigh, in which he played a sailor on leave in Hollywood for four days. A major success, it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\", sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 1946, Sinatra briefly appeared at the end of Richard Whorf's commercially successful Till the Clouds Roll By, a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, in which he sang \\"Ol' Man River.  In 1949, Sinatra co-starred with Gene Kelly in the Technicolor musical Take Me Out to the Ball Game, a film set in 1908, in which Sinatra and Kelly play baseball players who are part-time vaudevillians. He teamed up with Kelly for a third time in On the Town, playing a sailor on leave in New York City. Today the film is rated very highly by critics, and in 2006 it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. Both Double Dynamite (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy produced by Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pevney's Meet Danny Wilson (1952) failed to make an impression. The New York World Telegram and Sun ran the headline \\"Gone on Frankie in '42; Gone in '52\\".  Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \\"Maggio\\" in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he \\"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\\". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is \\"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\\", commenting that his death scene is \\"one of the best ever photographed\\".  In 1954 Sinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film Young at Heart, and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir Suddenly.  Sinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in The Man With The Golden Arm (1955). After roles in Guys and Dolls, and The Tender Trap, Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as hospital orderly in Stanley Kramer's debut picture, Not as a Stranger. During production, Sinatra got drunk with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer's dressing room. Kramer vowed to never hire Sinatra again at the time, and later regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in The Pride and the Passion (1957).  In 1956 Sinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in High Society for MGM, earning a reported 250,000 for the picture. The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over 13 million at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of 1956. In 1957, Sinatra starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's Pal Joey, for which he won for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" to Hayworth to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in The Joker Is Wild; the song \\"All the Way\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958 Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running and Kings Go Forth with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. \\"High Hopes\\", sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, A Hole in the Head (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks.  Due to an obligation he owed to 20th Century Fox for walking off the set of Henry King's Carousel (1956), in 1960 Sinatra starred opposite Shirley MacLaine, Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan in Can-Can. He earned 200,000 and 25% of the profits for the performance. Later that year he starred in the Las Vegas-set Ocean's 11, the first film to feature the Rat Pack together and the start of a \\"new era of screen cool\\" for Santopietro. Sinatra personally financed the film, and paid Martin and Davis Jr. fees of 150,000 and 125,000 respectively, sums considered exorbitant for the period. In 1962, Sinatra had a leading role opposite Laurence Harvey in The Manchurian Candidate, which he considered to be the role he was most excited about and the high point of his film career. Vincent Canby, writing for the magazine Variety, found the portrayal of Sinatra's character to be \\"a wide-awake pro creating a straight, quietly humorous character of some sensitivity.\\" He appeared with the Rat Pack in the western Sergeants 3, following it with 4 for Texas in 1963. For his performance in Come Blow Your Horn, he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.  Though 1965's Von Ryan's Express was a major success, and he had directed None but the Brave that year, in the mid 1960s, Brad Dexter wanted to \\"breathe new life\\" in Sinatra's film career by helping him display the same professional pride in his films as he did his recordings. On one occasion, he gave Sinatra Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange (1962) to read, with the idea of making a film, but Sinatra thought it had no potential and did not understand a word.  In the late 1960s, Sinatra became known for playing detectives, including Tony Rome in Tony Rome (1967) and its sequel Lady In Cement (1968). He also played a similar role in 1968's The Detective.  In 1970, Sinatra starred opposite George Kennedy in the western Dirty Dingus Magee, an \\"abysmal\\" affair according to Santopietro, which was panned by the critics. The following year, Sinatra received a Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award and had intended to play Detective Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971), but had to turn the role down due to developing Dupuytren's contracture in his hand. Sinatra's last major film role was opposite Faye Dunaway in Brian G. Hutton's The First Deadly Sin (1980). Santopietro said that as a troubled New York City homicide cop, Sinatra gave an \\"extraordinarily rich\\", heavily layered characterization, one which \\"made for one terrific farewell\\" to his film career. Question: did he win any awards. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Frank Sinatra won awards for his acting in movies. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film \\"From Here to Eternity.\\" He also received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture for the same role. Additionally, Sinatra won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \\"Pal Joey.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Following their first win of the season, the Colts faced another divisional rival in the Tennessee Titans. After being forced to punt on their first offensive drive, the Colts' defense forced a fumble that was recovered by Ricky Jean-Francois and set up the Colts inside Titan territory. After a 37-yard pass from quarterback Andrew Luck to T. Y. Hilton set the Colts up at the one yard line, Trent Richardson scored on the next play, putting the Colts up 7-0. An onside kick gave the ball back to the Colts, which led to an eleven play, 44-yard drive that ended in a touchdown pass from Luck to Dwayne Allen. The Colts' defense again forced a turnover on the Titans' next possession, with Charlie Whitehurst throwing an interception to Mike Adams. Luck and the Colts' offense again drove down the field, though this time having to settle for a field goal, extending the lead to 17-0. Tennessee scored their first points midway through the second quarter on a Ryan Succop. The Colts responded on their next possession with a 30-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri. A Luck interception late in the half, set up the Titans in Colts' territory and allowed them to score on a pass from Whitehurst to Delanie Walker, cutting the Colts' lead to 20-10 at halftime. The Colts' scored on their first offensive possession of the second half, on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Luck to Reggie Wayne and then later in the quarter on a pass from Luck to Coby Fleener, extending the Colts' lead to 34-10. Tennessee responded with an eight play, 80-yard drive that ended with a touchdown run from Bishop Sankey. Luck completed his fourth touchdown pass of the game early in the fourth quarter, this time on a 15-yard pass to Ahmad Bradshaw, giving the Colts a 41-17 lead. Late in the game, Adams again forced another turnover, with Zach Mettenberger throwing the interception. During the game, Reggie Wayne caught seven passes for 119 yards and one touchdown, which was enough to move him to seventh on the NFL all-time receptions list and tenth on the most receiving yards list. With the win, the Colts improved to 2-2. How many touchdowns did Luck throw for?","output":"Andrew Luck threw for four touchdowns in the game.

Options: - more rest - rest more - were sick - drink water - you're sick  The answer is \\"you're sick\\" because The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"You're sick,\\" because this statement indicates that the mother is aware of her son's illness and is prioritizing his health over his attendance at school. In this scenario, the mother likely wants her son to focus on recovery and avoid exacerbating the illness. The mom is probably saying, \\"You're sick,\\" as a way to remind her son of the current situation and the reason behind her decision. It shows that she is concerned about his well-being, empathizes with his condition, and wants him to take the necessary steps to recover from his sickness. Attending school while sick could potentially worsen his health and even infect others; thus, it is best for him to stay at home and get proper rest. Furthermore, the other options do not directly address the cause or justify the reason for the mom's decision. The options \\"more rest\\" and \\"rest more\\" imply that the son needs more sleep, but they do not specify the reason. These phrases could be used in any situation where the mom believes her son is tired, regardless of whether he is ill or not. The option \\"were sick\\" uses incorrect grammar (it should be \\"we're sick\\") and doesn't clearly provide the explanation behind the choice. If the mother meant, \\"we're sick,\\" it would suggest that both she and her son are ill, which is not relevant to the son staying home from school. Lastly, the option \\"drink water\\" is practical advice, but it doesn't answer the question of why the son should stay in bed instead of going to school. In this context, the mom's intention is to address her son's illness, make him aware of the situation, and focus on recovery. Therefore, the answer \\"you're sick\\" provides the most suitable explanation for the mom's decision and aligns with her concern for her son's well-being. By making this statement, the mother demonstrates an understanding of the importance of prioritizing health over school attendance and wants to ensure that her son has the best opportunity to recover quickly and without complications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Up to the end of World War II, the vast majority of the population of Stettin were Lutheran Protestants. Historically, the number of inhabitants doubled from 6,081 in 1720, to 12,360 in 1740, and reached 21,255 in 1812, with only 476 Catholics and 5 Jews.

Q:Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Formed in 1983 under the name Legacy, the band's current lineup comprises guitarists Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick, lead vocalist Chuck Billy, drummer Gene Hoglan, and bassist Steve Di Giorgio. Since its inception, Testament has had numerous lineup changes, leaving Peterson as the only constant member. Billy replaced original singer Steve \\"Zetro\\" Souza (who left the band to join Exodus as the replacement of Paul Baloff) in 1986, prior to the recording of their first studio album, The Legacy, and has been a member of the band since. As early as 2009, Testament commenced writing new material for their tenth album. In an interview with Metalheadz, guitarist Eric Peterson stated that there were about four songs written and that \\"there's other guys in the band who like to play the more rock melodic style but the next one is gonna be a bit heavier.\\" In a January 2011 interview during the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise, frontman Chuck Billy revealed that Testament had been working on six new songs, with four or five \\"maybe left to write,\\" and would begin recording their new album by early March. On 18 May 2011, guitarist Alex Skolnick posted an update on his Twitter, saying, \\"Another tune done! My riffs from last week [plus] some of [fellow Testament guitarist Eric Peterson's plus] new ones we wrote today. Planning one more, then we've got more than we need.\\"  Testament began recording their tenth studio album on June 20, 2011. Drummer Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a \\"serious injury\\", although he was expected to rejoin when the band tours to support the album. Gene Hoglan, who played drums on the band's 1997 album Demonic, filled in for Bostaph. It was also reported that Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler would make a special guest appearance on a couple of bonus tracks.

Q:Question: Miranda wasn't sure about what she was doing, she just knew that she couldn't stop moving her smelly feet. This was a problem, because she was told to do what? Options: - shoes - stay still - hands - walk - stink  Explain why a human would choose \\"stay still\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"stay still\\" as the answer to the question above because the situation described in the question suggests that Miranda is having an issue with being unable to stop moving her smelly feet. When looking at the given options, \\"stay still\\" is the most relevant and appropriate choice, as it directly relates to Miranda's inability to control her feet's movement.  Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are not suitable answers: - Shoes: Although Miranda's feet are smelly, the question does not mention anything about shoes or being instructed to wear shoes or do something related to them. - Hands: The question is focusing on Miranda's feet, and there's no reference to her hands or any action she's instructed to take with her hands, making it an irrelevant choice. - Walk: Choosing \\"walk\\" could be considered a reasonable choice if Miranda was asked to walk but had difficulties controlling her feet's movement; however, based on the question's context, it doesn't appear that she's having issues with walking, but rather stopping her feet from moving. - Stink: This option is related to the smelly feet, but it doesn't seem like she was instructed to make her feet smell. Instead, the problem lies with her inability to control the movement of her feet. Therefore, considering the given context and options, a human would choose \\"stay still\\" as the most accurate answer because it directly relates to Miranda's issue of not being able to stop moving her smelly feet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now let me explain why other answers are wrong. [1] is wrong because it starts discussing when to prune the tree and how to do it, but the question is about the disinfecting process of tools. [2] is wrong because it talks about removing dead or diseased fruit and using insecticides, which is not related to the disinfection of pruning tools.

Please answer a question about the following article about Pharmaceutical industry: By the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.

Here are possible answers to this question: - suburbs - large house - farm house - palace - country estate  I believe the correct choice is \\"large house\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"large house,\\" and there are several reasons why this option is the most suitable among the alternatives presented. First, let's consider each option and how it fits into the context of a back courtyard leading to a walkout basement: 1. \\"Suburbs\\" - This refers to a residential area located on the outskirts of a city, typically characterized by a prevalence of single-family homes. Although it is possible to find houses with walkout basements in suburban neighborhoods, this term does not provide specific information about the type of building attached to the back courtyard.  2. \\"Large house\\" - This option provides a much clearer picture of the building in question. A large house signifies a spacious and potentially multi-storied residence with numerous rooms. It seems more fitting for a back courtyard and walkout basement to be part of such a residence, given that these features require the kind of space a large house could accommodate. 3. \\"Farm house\\" - While farmhouses might have back courtyards and even walkout basements, they are primarily associated with agricultural lands and rural surroundings. Although it is a somewhat plausible option, the question does not provide any contextual clues to suggest that the house in question belongs to a farm setting. 4. \\"Palace\\" - This term refers to the residence of royalty or other members of higher social circles. A palace is likely to have a courtyard and potentially even a walkout basement. However, given the grand and ostentatious nature of a palace, using such terminology to describe this particular setting seems less fitting than simply referring to the structure as a large house. 5. \\"Country estate\\" - This option refers to a large, multi-acre property, often owned by people from wealthier social backgrounds. While a country estate might include expansive courtyards and walkout basements, this term places more emphasis on the surrounding land rather than the house itself. Therefore, describing the building as a large house seems more precise and fitting for the context provided. Taking all these options into account, \\"large house\\" emerges as the most fitting and accurate choice.

At a dinner, Nick encounters Hillary Flammond, a member of the local resistance movement, attempting to avoid the authorities. He pretends to be her date to get to know her, and performs an impromptu song and dance, mistakenly thinking he was asked to do so, to the delight of Hillary and the diners but to the annoyance of General Streck, the mastermind of the \\"reunification\\" plot.

Utada Hikaru (Yu Duo Tian  hikaru, born January 19, 1983), who also goes by the mononym Utada (English: ), is a Japanese-American singer-songwriter and producer. Born in New York City to Japanese parents, record producer Utada Teruzane and enka singer Abe Junko, Utada began to write music and lyrics at an early age and often traveled to Tokyo, as a result of her father's job. Eventually, a recording contract with Toshiba-EMI was signed and, under the stage name \\"Cubic U\\", Utada released her English-language debut album Precious in early 1998, but was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, her Japanese-language debut First Love was released and became an instant success. On December 16, 2008, information leaked onto the Internet that Utada's next English-language single, titled \\"Come Back to Me\\", would be scheduled for airplay release through U.S. Rhythmic/Crossover and Mainstream formats on February 9 and 10, 2009 respectively via Island Records. The new English album, titled This Is the One, was released on March 14, 2009 in Japan and on May 12, 2009 in the United States. This Is the One debuted at number 1 in Japan on March 13, 2009, the day it was released in Japan, but became Utada's first album not to top the weekly chart since Precious. On March 30, 2009 she appeared on New York City radio station Z-100 (100.3), the largest pop radio program in the U.S., and granted a live on-air interview on the station's Elvis Duran Morning Show, a breakthrough that would lead to a promotional schedule up and through the album's international physical release on May 12. Utada also sang the theme song for the second Evangelion film, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance. The single was released on June 27, 2009, and is a remix of her previous single, \\"Beautiful World\\". The new single is titled Beautiful World -PLANiTb Acoustica Mix-.  On October 14, Utada stated that she was writing lyrics that were due on October 15. She also added that some \\"German magic\\" would be added to the music. It was revealed that Goetz B, who had previously worked with Utada on her album Ultra Blue was in the process of mixing tracks for her.  On November 30, 2009, at Studio Coast, Tokyo, Utada sung a duet of Let It Snow with pop singer Mika.  On December 21, 2009, Utada's Dirty Desire remixes were released only on Amazon.com, Zune Marketplace, and the U.S. iTunes Store, in support of This Is the One and her upcoming tour.

The answer:","output":"The person skipped their blog yesterday because they were preoccupied with other activities that they considered more important or enjoyable at the time. Initially, they mentioned having \\"better things to do,\\" which suggests that they prioritized some other tasks or interests over blogging.

Answer the question:   Mona urinated yesterday morning and the urine was very light. When she urinated today the urine was very dark. Which urination contained less water yesterday morning or today? The answer to this question is:","output":"Today's urination contained less water as compared to yesterday morning's urination.  The color of urine can be an indication of an individual's hydration levels, and it is based on the concentration of various waste products and solutes present in the urine. When a person is well-hydrated, their kidneys function efficiently in filtering waste products and solutes from the bloodstream, resulting in relatively larger volumes of diluted (or light-colored) urine. Light yellow or clear urine typically signifies optimum hydration, as there is more water present to dilute the waste products and solutes. On the other hand, dark-colored urine often indicates that there is less water present to dissolve and eliminate waste products, and the kidneys are retaining more water to maintain a balance in the body. This results in the production of smaller volumes of concentrated urine, which consequently appears darker. Some factors that contribute to dark-colored urine include dehydration, certain medications or supplements, and even some foods. However, it is essential to note that the color of the urine can also be influenced by other factors such as certain medical conditions or the presence of substances produced by the body. In Mona's case, it can be inferred that yesterday morning, she was adequately hydrated, so her urine had a higher water content, leading to a lighter color. In contrast, today, her urine is dark, suggesting that it contains less water as compared to her urine from yesterday morning. There could be several reasons behind this difference, such as her fluid intake patterns, dietary habits, or physical activities. However, if Mona regularly experiences dark-colored urine or notices additional symptoms, it may be wise for her to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any potential underlying medical issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: If you just recently moved into an old home or inherited a space from a relative, check in storage locations to see what you may find. Keep an eye out for any chests, drawers, or briefcases that may be used to contain other items. Search high in the rafters as well. For instance, sometimes people hide money or valuables in a suitcase and stash it in the attic. This is when you can break out the metal detector. You never know what kind of items were hidden throughout your yard or garden, such as coins or arrowheads. These items may be hidden inside of other small containers. Look for small depressions in your yard, and keep an eye out for any items poking above the surface. You can also find items buried under the edge of a walkway or driveway. While this may be less obvious, there may be secret areas hidden throughout your home. Search behind old wallpaper, under the staircase, or near the floorboards, for instance. You may have to get creative with where to look. As they say, “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure”. You never know what people are throwing away in the dumpster! If you live in a community or development, take a look for items at the top while you throw away your garbage. If you see something interesting or potentially valuable, remove it from the bin and take it home.  Be sure to use a disinfectant cleaner to wipe down the item, as it was in the trash and could be ridden in germs. For instance, you could discover an old violin that is worth up to 50,000. Avoid trespassing on private property. Buildings around the house are great places to search for treasure. Be sure to investigate high and low, and keep an eye out for loose bricks or boards. Oftentimes, these areas have loose floorboards where you can discover lost coin collections, gems, or gold.  You can find a storage building full of random antiques, tools, or appliances, for instance. In addition, keep an eye out for scrap metal to sell or items to repurpose.","output":"When inheriting or moving into an old home, it is essential to explore various storage locations for potentially valuable and hidden items.
