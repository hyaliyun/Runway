Question: What is the United states energy giant Connex losing control of ? Movie title: Syriana Movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir...

Answer based on context: In the Governorate of Estonia, Estonians called for freedom of the press and assembly, for universal suffrage, and for national autonomy. On 29 October , the Russian army opened fire in a meeting on a street market in Tallinn in which about 8 000-10 000 people participated, killing 94 and injuring over 200. The October Manifesto was supported in Estonia and the Estonian flag was displayed publicly for the first time. Jaan Tõnisson used the new political freedoms to widen the rights of Estonians by establishing the first Estonian political party - National Progress Party. Another, more radical political organisation, the Estonian Social Democratic Workers' Union was founded as well. The moderate supporters of Tõnisson and the more radical supporters of Jaan Teemant could not agree about how to continue with the revolution, and only agreed that both wanted to limit the rights of Baltic Germans and to end Russification. The radical views were publicly welcomed and in December 1905, martial law was declared in Tallinn. A total of 160 manors were looted, resulting in ca. 400 workers and peasants being killed by the army. Estonian gains from the revolution were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood. How many years did the Estonian revolution last?","output":"To determine how many years the Estonian revolution lasted, we need to identify the starting and ending points of the revolution mentioned in the given text. The text discusses events that took place in 1905, such as the Russian army opening fire on a meeting in Tallinn on 29 October, and the October Manifesto being supported in Estonia. It also mentions that moderate supporters of Tõnisson and radical supporters of Jaan Teemant could not agree on how to continue the revolution and only agreed on limiting Baltic German rights and ending Russification. Furthermore, the text mentions that the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance their aspiration of national statehood. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the Estonian revolution began in 1905, and although the gains from the revolution were minimal, it ultimately contributed to the advancement of Estonian national statehood by 1917. Therefore, the Estonian revolution can be considered to have lasted for 12 years (from 1905 to 1917)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now, you're curious to know which event happened first, right? So, let's say you have two blocks of legos. One is marked with 'Arias led a rebellion' and the other with 'Valdez was elected president.' You're trying to stack them one on top of the other in the order in which they happened. Imagine you're watching a movie and the first scene shows Arias leading a rebellion. This was a time when Arias thought things were not going well where he lived, so he gathered some friends to make a big change. That's what we mean by 'leading a rebellion.' This is the first block we are going to put in our Lego tower. Next, in the movie, time passed and the scene changes. This time, it showed Valdez being elected president, which means people chose him to be their leader. This is the second Lego block. So, to answer your question, the block marked with 'Arias led a rebellion' was placed first, followed by the 'Valdez was elected president' block. That means Arias leading the rebellion happened before Valdez was elected as the president. Just like our Lego blocks, sometimes, in history, one event can make way for another to happen.

A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman. Notable swing men (also known as wing players) include Jimmy Butler, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Joe Johnson, Andre Iguodala, Andrew Wiggins, Evan Turner and Tyreke Evans. In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6' 4\\" (1.93 m) to 6' 7\\" (2.01 m).  - The Kansas Jayhawks, commonly referred to as KU, are the teams of the athletic department at the University of Kansas.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

Consider the possibility of being left alone, on your own for some time.","output":"After committing to creating a disaster preparedness plan for older citizens and considering the possibility of being left alone for some time, the next steps are as follows: 1. Identify potential risks and disasters: Assess the types of natural and man-made disasters that are most likely to occur in your area, such as hurricanes, wildfires, or power outages. Consider how these events may specifically impact older citizens, taking into account their potential mobility challenges and medical needs. 2. Develop a communication plan: Establish a system for contacting family members, friends, and emergency services during a disaster. Ensure older citizens have a list of important phone numbers and are familiar with these contact points. Consider incorporating smart technology, such as panic buttons, into the plan for easy access during emergencies. 3. Create an emergency kit: Prepare an easily accessible kit that contains essential items, such as a flashlight, batteries, a portable radio, water, non-perishable food, medication, blankets, and cash. Ensure older citizens know the location of their emergency kit and can access it easily if needed. 4. Plan for medical needs: Work with older citizens to compile a list of current medications, medical conditions, and allergies. It is important to have a backup supply of essential medications, as well as copies of important medical documents, such as prescriptions and insurance cards. 5. Establish a support network: Identify neighbors, friends, or family members who can check on older citizens during times of need. Ensure each member of the support network is familiar with the disaster preparedness plan and knows how to access the emergency kit and medication list. 6. Develop an evacuation plan: Create a plan that outlines how older citizens will evacuate their home in case of an emergency. This should include detailed instructions for using ramps, wheelchairs, or other mobility devices, if applicable. Practice the evacuation plan with older citizens so that they feel confident in their ability to execute it. 7. Consider special needs: Take into account any additional challenges that older citizens may face during a disaster, such as hearing loss or cognitive decline. Develop strategies to address these needs, such as using a whistle or door-knocking to alert those who may struggle to hear a phone ringing. 8. Stay informed: Encourage older citizens to stay informed about potential threats and disasters in their area by regularly checking local news and weather reports. Consider using emergency alert systems or apps to receive notifications about potential disasters. 9. Update the plan regularly: Review and update the disaster preparedness plan periodically to ensure it remains effective and current. Encourage ongoing dialogue between older citizens and their support network to address any changes in medical conditions or living situations. 10. Educate and empower older citizens: Provide resources and training to older citizens to help them gain the skills and knowledge necessary to respond effectively during a disaster. This may include first aid training, emergency preparedness classes, or workshops on using technology to stay connected during emergencies. By taking these steps, you can create a comprehensive disaster preparedness plan for older citizens that considers their unique needs and vulnerabilities.

Definition: In this task, you will be shown an English sentence. You need to classify the sentence as either a representation of an anaphor number agreement or as an incorrect representation. An anaphor is an expression whose interpretation depends upon another expression. Anaphor number agreement is a restriction where a phrase agrees with the preceeding expression: plurals match plurals or singular expressions match singular expressions. In this task a valid representation of anaphor number agreement should be denoted as 'good' while everything else should be denoted as 'bad'. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct instance of a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality. An incorrect representation is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match. Input: Diane has worked with themselves. Output:","output":"In this task, you are given an English sentence, and you need to determine if the sentence correctly demonstrates anaphor number agreement or not. Here are the simple steps to follow: 1. Understand the definitions: An anaphor is an expression whose meaning relies on another expression. Anaphor number agreement is when an expression agrees in number (plural or singular) with another expression that comes before it. 2. Examine the given sentence: Look at the subject (noun) and the self-referencing pronoun (anaphor) in the sentence. 3. Check for agreement: Determine if the subject and the anaphor match in plurality (e.g., both are singular or both are plural). 4. Provide your judgment: If the anaphor and subject match in number, classify the sentence as 'good'—demonstrating correct anaphor number agreement. If they don't match, classify the sentence as 'bad'. In the given example: Input: Diane has worked with themselves. The subject is \\"Diane\\" (singular), and the anaphor is \\"themselves\\" (plural).

Options: a). keep goading jan to do it; b). cut ties with Tracy for the negative influence; c). take Tracy's advice and risk arrest; A:","output":"From the provided information, it is not possible to definitively determine what Tracy will want to do next, but we can explore multiple potential scenarios based on the options presented. Option A: Keep goading Jan to do it In this scenario, Tracy might continue to push Jan to carry out the illegal act, possibly wanting to gain satisfaction from watching someone else do something wrong or dangerous. This may be due to Tracy's desire for excitement or personal gain. If Tracy has a manipulative personality, she might enjoy the control she has over Jan in this situation, or even want Jan to be in trouble in order to exploit her further. Option B: Cut ties with Tracy for the negative influence If this option were to happen, it would actually be Jan's choice to cut ties with Tracy due to her negative influence. Jan might decide that associating with someone who encourages illegal activities is not in her best interest and could harm her future or reputation. This decision could be influenced by Jan's sense of morality, fear of consequences, or her realization that Tracy does not have her best interests at heart.  Option C: Take Tracy's advice and risk arrest In this scenario, Jan would decide to go along with Tracy's encouragement and commit the illegal act. She might do this for a number of reasons, such as trusting in Tracy's judgment, experiencing pressure from Tracy or others, wanting to impress Tracy, or simply being intrigued by the idea of doing something illicit. However, this choice puts Jan at risk of facing legal consequences and damaging her personal and professional life. If arrested, this could have a lasting impact on Jan's future, as well as her relationships with family, friends, and employers. In conclusion, it is hard to predict exactly what Tracy will want to do next, but it is likely that her actions will be influenced by her personality and goals, as well as the dynamics between her and Jan. Regardless of the specific outcome, it is important for Jan to carefully consider her own values, priorities, and the potential consequences before deciding how to proceed in this situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sally is pulling two wagons. The red wagon is full of sand, and the blue wagon is empty. The wagon that will be easier to pull is the red wagon or blue wagon? Answer:","output":"The wagon that will be easier for Sally to pull is the blue wagon, which is empty. To understand why the blue wagon is easier to pull, it is important to first understand the concept of mass and inertia. Mass is the measure of the amount of matter in an object. In this case, the red wagon is full of sand, which means it has a greater mass compared to the empty blue wagon. Inertia, on the other hand, is the property of an object that resists any change in its state of motion. In other words, an object with greater mass has greater inertia, and it requires greater force to change its state of motion. When Sally attempts to pull the two wagons, she is essentially trying to change their states of motion - from stationary to moving. Since the blue wagon is empty, it has a smaller mass and hence less inertia than the red wagon, which is full of sand. Consequently, it takes less force to overcome the inertia of the blue wagon and set it in motion, meaning it is easier for Sally to pull the blue wagon compared to the red wagon. The underlying scientific principle governing the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration is Newton's Second Law of Motion. According to this law, the force required to accelerate an object is directly proportional to the object's mass and the acceleration it experiences (F = ma). In other words, the greater the mass of an object, the greater the force required to achieve a certain acceleration. Applying Newton's Second Law to Sally's situation, since the red wagon is more massive due to the sand it contains, a greater force is needed to achieve the same acceleration as that of the blue wagon. Conversely, the blue wagon, being less massive, requires less force to achieve the same acceleration. Therefore, Sally will find it easier to pull the blue wagon rather than the red wagon, as it requires less effort to overcome the smaller inertia and set the blue wagon in motion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This led to claims that Greece (similar claims have been made about other European countries like Italy) had not actually met all five accession criteria, and the common perception that Greece entered the Eurozone through \\"falsified\\" deficit numbers. Question: By how much did the budget deficit of Greece exceed the 3% limit in the reference year of 1999?","output":"In the reference year of 1999, the budget deficit of Greece exceeded the 3% limit by 0.38% as it reached 3.38% of GDP."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Question: \\"Why was Melaka not an ideal place for most people to live in its early days?\\" Answer: \\"The place was a vassal of China\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not correct. The question asks about the living conditions in Melaka during its early days, not its political status.  In its early days, Melaka was not considered an ideal place to live for several reasons. Firstly, the land was described as infertile and swampy which makes agriculture, a primary means of subsistence in ancient societies, challenging. Secondly, the river was described as small and sluggish - these conditions could have made it difficult to get fresh water, fish, or use the river for transportation. Despite these negative aspects, Melaka's positive attributes included a sheltered harbor, protected from monsoons, making it a desirable location for naval activities. Furthermore, its strategic location and deep-water channel attracted trade-wind traffic from the Indian Ocean. The Chinese were the first to realize Melaka's commercial potential and established it as a vibrant port and trade center."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides Movie plot: Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) travels to London to locate the person who has been impersonating him. The impostor has reportedly been recruiting a crew to search for the legendary Fountain of Youth. First Sparrow rescues his former first mate, Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally), who is about to be hanged, though the two are captured. Jack is brought before King George II (Richard Griffiths), who wants him to guide an expedition to the Fountain before the Spanish find it. Heading the expedition is Jack's old nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), now a privateer in service to the British Navy after having lost Jack's ship, the Black Pearl, as well as his leg.Jack escapes, and is found by his father, Captain Teague (Keith Richards), who warns Jack about the Fountain's tests. Jack soon discovers that the impostor is Angelica (Penélope Cruz), his former lover and daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), who possesses supernatural powers and practices voodoo magic. Jack is forced to join Blackbeard's crew and to lead them to the Fountain. Meanwhile, Gibbs, who memorized, then destroyed, Sparrow's map, barters with Barbossa to lead him and his crew to the Fountain.Aboard Blackbeard's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, Jack learns that the Fountain's water must be drunk simultaneously from two silver chalices once belonging to Juan Ponce de León.

Read this: Annelids' cuticles are made of collagen fibers, usually in layers that spiral in alternating directions so that the fibers cross each other. These are secreted by the one-cell deep epidermis (outermost skin layer). A few marine annelids that live in tubes lack cuticles, but their tubes have a similar structure, and mucus-secreting glands in the epidermis protect their skins. Under the epidermis is the dermis, which is made of connective tissue, in other words a combination of cells and non-cellular materials such as collagen. Below this are two layers of muscles, which develop from the lining of the coelom (body cavity): circular muscles make a segment longer and slimmer when they contract, while under them are longitudinal muscles, usually four distinct strips, whose contractions make the segment shorter and fatter. Some annelids also have oblique internal muscles that connect the underside of the body to each side. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What do non-cuticle annelids use to protect their offspring?","output":"The given text does not provide information about what non-cuticle annelids use to protect their offspring.

Here is a hypothesis: The split caused Veneto, Pentapolo, also Rome and Naples. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis can be concluded as true if the premise is true, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: 1. The divisions resulted in Veneto (Venice and its hinterland). 2. The divisions resulted in Emilia (between Ravenna and Modena). 3. The divisions resulted in Pentapolo (between Rimini and Perugia). 4. The divisions resulted in Rome. 5. The divisions resulted in Naples (with Sicily and Calabria). Hypothesis: 1. The split caused Veneto. 2. The split caused Pentapolo. 3. The split caused Rome. 4. The split caused Naples. Now, let's compare the premise with the hypothesis. 1. Veneto: The premise states that Veneto (Venice and its hinterland) is a result of the divisions. The hypothesis also states that Veneto is a result of the split. Therefore, the premise supports this part of the hypothesis. 2. Pentapolo: The premise states that Pentapolo (between Rimini and Perugia) is a result of the divisions. The hypothesis also states that Pentapolo is a result of the split. Therefore, the premise supports this part of the hypothesis. 3. Rome: The premise states that Rome is a result of the divisions. The hypothesis also states that Rome is a result of the split. Therefore, the premise supports this part of the hypothesis. 4. Naples: The premise states that Naples (with Sicily and Calabria) is a result of the divisions. The hypothesis also states that Naples is a result of the split. Therefore, the premise supports this part of the hypothesis. However, it's important to note that the premise includes the formation of Emilia (between Ravenna and Modena), which is not mentioned or addressed in the hypothesis. Although the hypothesis is partly supported by the premise, it doesn't provide a complete representation of the premise since it omits the Emilia region's formation due to the divisions. In conclusion, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is partially true. It is correct in attributing the formation of Veneto, Pentapolo, Rome, and Naples to the divisions; however, it does not take into consideration the formation of Emilia. The hypothesis would need to include Emilia's emergence due to the divisions to fully represent the premise and can then be fully concluded as true if the premise is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  Paragraph: Two teams were competing in a 5 km race. White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race.

He always relished every bite of his mother's chocolate frosted cake which was served during family celebrations and gatherings. On the other hand, the lemon frosting, while delicious in its own citrusy way, just didn't hold the same special place in his heart. One beautiful spring day, when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom, John was walking through his local park, enjoying the warm sun on his face and the breathtaking sight of petals dancing in the wind. It was during these walks that John liked to reminisce about his childhood, with his beloved chocolate-frosted cake and the laughter of his siblings still ringing fresh in his ears. Lost in his thoughts, he happened upon an old-fashioned bakery tucked away in a corner of the park. The sweet aroma of freshly baked goods brought a contented smile to his face, and the inviting scent pulled him closer like a moth to a flame. He couldn't resist stepping into the bakery, and the sight that welcomed him was something straight out of his dreams. Delicate pastries lined up like soldiers in beautifully crafted display cases, while cheerful employees worked busily behind the counter. In one corner of the shop, he saw a group of elderly gentlemen sipping their coffees and engaging in lively conversation. In another, a young mother trying to teach her toddler how to eat a croissant without scattering crumbs everywhere. John approached the counter, with an elderly woman greeting him warmly and asking what he would like to order. He scanned the myriad of delicious treats before him, and his eyes locked onto a familiar sight - a chocolate-frosted cake that looked just like the one his mother used to make. His heart swelled with fondness, and without hesitation, he ordered a slice. As he sat down to enjoy his childhood favorite with a steaming cup of coffee on the side, a slightly mischievous thought crossed his mind. Why not try the lemon-frosted cake too? He couldn't remember the last time he had tasted one, and perhaps now was the best time to give it another chance. When the two slices arrived, he carefully took a bite of the chocolate-frosted cake. The taste transported him back to those bygone days, and he sighed with happiness. Then, hesitating for just a moment, he took a bite of the lemon-frosted cake. To his surprise, it was a pleasant and refreshing change from the chocolate. The citrusy twist teased his palate, leaving him pondering what he had missed out on all these years. As he continued to alternate between the two slices, John couldn't help but wonder at the way life's flavors intertwine and complement each other, like these two seemingly opposing cakes. While he would always hold a special place in his heart for the chocolate frosting, he realized that maybe it was time to make room for the lemon frosting as well. Life was meant to be full of its sweet and tangy moments, after all. And so, with a newfound appreciation for the lemon-frosted cake, John left the bakery carrying an extra slice with him. It was as if he was taking a piece of his childhood, combined with the broader spectrum of life's experiences, with him as he continued his journey through the park, inspired to explore life's vast and varying flavors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Falklands, known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, lie in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Argentinean coast and have been under British rule since 1833. But Argentina has always claimed sovereignty over them. The two nations fought a war over the islands in 1982. Tuesday's decree followed an accusation made last week by the Argentine government that a ship docked on the mainland was preparing to transport tubes to the Falklands for oil and gas exploration. The","output":"Argentine government's decision to implement the permit requirement is aimed at asserting its authority over the disputed territory while simultaneously putting pressure on British oil companies operating in the region. President Kirchner's action could be viewed as a means to thwart further exploration and drilling activities by those companies, potentially in response to the increasing competition over resources in the region. Furthermore, this move may not only serve as a reminder of the long-standing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom, but also to underline Argentina's determination to protect its perceived rights and interests in the Falkland Islands. It could be perceived as an attempt to increase diplomatic pressure on the United Kingdom to engage in negotiations about the sovereignty of the islands, something that has been stagnant for years. However, this new requirement has the potential to escalate the already simmering tensions between the two nations. The British government could view the permit decree as a direct challenge to their sovereignty over the Falklands, and it may prompt them to respond with measures of their own. This could ultimately lead to a renewed standoff between the nations on the matter, jeopardizing diplomatic ties between them. In conclusion, the Argentine President's decision to require permits for ships traveling from Argentina to the Falkland Islands is a multi-faceted move seeking to assert control over the disputed territory, curb British oil exploration efforts, and potentially push the United Kingdom into negotiations regarding the islands' sovereignty. However, such actions also carry the risk of further straining relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom, leading to a potential escalation of tensions regarding this sensitive issue."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  Throw counterfeit money into the crowd.  for the following movie plot:  Four stage magicians, J.

Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games).  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.  - The Game Boy line is a line of handheld game consoles developed, manufactured, and marketed by Nintendo.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Food is put into mouth - Food is chewed and mixed with saliva (spit) - Food travels down the esophagus (throat) - Food travels into the stomach - Acid in the stomach breaks the food down further - Food travels into the small intestine - Nutrients from food are absorbed into the blood stream - Food travels into the large intestine - Most of the remaining material is now waste - The waste is eventually removed from the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more food travels into the stomach happens, how will it affect MORE food being digested.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's consider and analyze each step of the process after the supposed perturbation, i.e., more food traveling into the stomach, and determine its effect on more food being digested and the overall process. Step 1: More food travels into the stomach - The stomach receives more food than usual, which could lead to a sense of fullness or overeating. Step 2: Acid in the stomach breaks the food down further - With more food in the stomach, it may take longer for the stomach acid to break down the food, and the stomach may produce more acid to handle the increased amount of food. Step 3: Food travels into the small intestine - As more partially digested food enters the small intestine, it could take longer to travel through it. The small intestine may need to work harder to move the increased amount of food. Step 4: Nutrients from food are absorbed into the bloodstream - With more food being digested, there is a greater potential for more nutrients to be absorbed into the bloodstream. However, it is also possible that the digestive system becomes less efficient at absorbing nutrients due to the increased workload and longer digestion time. Step 5: Food travels into the large intestine - The increased volume of food will result in more material entering the large intestine, which may take longer to process and could lead to constipation or indigestion in some cases. Step 6: Most of the remaining material is now waste - With more food consumed and digested, there will likely be an increase in the amount of waste produced. Step 7: The waste is eventually removed from the body - Because of the increased amount of waste, the body may take longer to eliminate it or have to eliminate it more frequently. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more food traveling into the stomach does have both direct and indirect effects on the process of digestion. While more food being digested could potentially lead to increased nutrient absorption, the digestive system might become less efficient, and there may be longer digestion times, increased waste production, and potential issues with constipation or indigestion."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Extending the period of time over which a force acts in order to lessen the force is a common practice in design. Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase. The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop. Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time. These changes all serve to decrease the amount of force it takes to stop the momentum in a car crash, which consequently saves lives.  I am facing a new situation today: Keith designs car seats. He noticed that some other car seats didn't have any padding. He marked it as case A. On the other hand, most of the seats he designed had padding. He marked it as case B. Keith needed to know pros and cons of both designs.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would case B take less or more time for the force to act than case A?

Britain's most pernicious invasive plant, Japanese knotweed, may have finally met its match in a two millimetre-long insect. It has plagued gardeners for decades and affected thousands of house sales because of its ability to grow more than 9ft in just ten weeks. But Britain's most pernicious invasive plant, Japanese knotweed, may have finally met its match in a two millimetre-long insect. Research on Aphalara itadori, a psyllid or plant louse similar to aphids, has established that it inhibits the growth of the knotweed and poses no risk to native species, including the plant's close relative rhubarb. Scientists at CABI, formerly Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International, announced that they have also succeeded in getting the insect to survive through British winters. Dr Kate Constantine, from CABI, said: 'The results confirmed the psyllid to be a high-specialised natural enemy of Japanese knotweed. The challenge now is to get the psyllid to establish in the natural environment which, as for any programme of this type, isn't easy.' Tens of thousands of specially bred lice were placed on knotweed at eight locations in England and Wales as part of the research. This was the first time the release of an alien insect species had been authorised in the European Union. The study found the insect would feed on the sap of the knotweed, inhibiting its growth - but it failed to breed on any of 90 other native British species, meaning that they would face no threat from the insect. Scientists say the number of colonies that have successfully over-wintered remains too small to be certain that the bug could widely establish itself in Britain. But if it does, they believe the bug will allow natural order to slowly reassert itself and knotweed could eventually be seen as just a 'mild nuisance'. Writing in The Ecologist, Dr  Constantine said: 'A more natural equilibrium is restored. Biological control doesn't aim to eradicate the target plant, but rather to reduce its vigour and invasiveness. Keeping the invasive plant in check ideally allows native plants to re-establish and flourish.' Scroll down for video. Research on Aphalara itadori, a psyllid or plant louse similar to aphids, has established that it inhibits the growth of Japanese knotweed. Elizabeth Abraham's house lost half its value because Japanese knotweed started taking over the back garden. The Government last year faced calls to do more to tackle the invader following reports that banks were refusing to offer mortgages on properties affected by knotweed. Homeowners faced bills of up to £20,000 to remove the prolific foreign invader before they could sell. Earlier this year, Elizabeth Abraham's house lost  half its value because Japanese knotweed started taking over the back garden. The 91-year-old was told the house in Swansea, which was expected to be valued at £80,000, will not sell for more than £45,000 because of the untamed wild weed. The destructive bamboo-like plant has flourished across the country and the Government estimates it would take £1.5billion to clear the infestation. It can grow more than 9ft in just ten weeks, and easily spreads from neighbouring homes, wasteland, waterways, railway lines or footpaths. Its extensive deep roots can penetrate roads, concrete, damage foundations and drains. Japanese knotweed - which has the scientific name fallopia japonica - was introduced into Britain by the Victorians. Incredibly invasive, it can grow four inches (ten centimetres) in a day from April to October and a tiny root can establish itself as a plant in just ten days. Apparently solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves clog waterways. Knotweed is recognised by its shovel-shaped leaves, bamboo-like stem and white flowers produced in autumn. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

In Victorian London, an unseen criminal begins masterminding his \\"perfect plot on paper\\" which starts with a robbery taking place and three cats stealing a pink diamond. Three constables spot them and give chase, but the cats escape to the rooftops and glide off into the night, giving the stolen diamond to a mysterious horseman. The next day, Dr. Watson rushes to 221B in Baker Street and informs his colleague Sherlock Holmes of the robbery. Holmes then calls his pet mouse Jerry to bring him a copy of the Times. Jerry heads out to buy it while encountering Tom on the way, who also has something for Holmes. Jerry returns to Holmes' flat and hands him the paper or what was left of it after the chase. Reading a letter Tom had given to them for the night, Holmes and Watson decide to go to the Bruce Nigel Theatre where a performer named Red is seen. Holmes is told that she is being blackmailed and Holmes suggests who the perpetrator might be – Professor Moriarty. Holmes deduces that the Star of Punjab, a diamond that is light sensitive to the light of a solar eclipse which was to happen the following day, is to be stolen by the mastermind of the blackmail. At the Punjab Embassy, Spike and Tyke are assigned to guard the Star of Punjab. Spike begins to teach Tyke how to be a good dog guard, but the three cats from the previous night steal the diamond while an unfocused Spike is not looking. The three cats then leave a small button and retreat. They climb out through a hole in Red's home that leads to the tunnel and escape before Holmes, Tom and Jerry arrive. Upon arriving, Jerry tricks Tom into stepping into a broken board and the trio check the tunnel. Finding sawdust, they retreat after hearing Tyke sounding the alarm. Holmes and Watson leave to find the shop where the button came from, while Tom and Jerry are left to take Red to Holmes' flat.

Gardener Keith Rogers says he prefers unconventional looking vegetables. He said he was frustrated shoppers cause waste by refusing to buy them. He suggests supermarkets sell misshapen vegetables at half price. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Unconventional Vegetables Why and How We Should Embrace the Odd-Looking Veg Subheading: Gardener Keith Rogers Advocates for the Sale of Misshapen Vegetables at Reduced Prices to Tackle Food Waste Introduction As the world is hectically searching for ways to address food waste, one gardener comes up with a seemingly simple idea. Keith Rogers, an experienced gardener, is advocating for the sale of unconventional, imperfect, or misshapen vegetables at half price in supermarkets, arguing that doing so will not only reduce waste but also encourage shoppers to change their mindset about what \\"good\\" produce looks like. The Problem with Conventional Standards In today's world, we have become obsessed with the appearance of our fruits and vegetables. We expect our produce to align with a specific set of aesthetic standards — it must be free of blemishes, perfectly symmetrical, and have uniform colors. Anything that deviates from these expectations is often overlooked and, as a result, contributes to the enormous amount of food waste produced each year. Rogers, who prefers to grow and consume unconventional looking vegetables, expressed his frustration with this issue. He believes that the inflexible standards that shoppers uphold for the appearance of their produce contribute significantly to food waste, and it is time for a change. Unconventional Vegetables at a Discount To combat this problem, Rogers suggests that supermarkets and grocery stores offer misshapen and imperfect vegetables at half price. This would not only encourage shoppers to be more open to purchasing and consuming these unique produce items but would also help to reduce waste. By providing customers with an incentive, such as a lower price, it would prompt people to reconsider their standards for fruits and vegetables. Moreover, as more consumers begin purchasing and enjoying imperfect vegetables, the stigma surrounding their appearance may begin to diminish. This may lead to a more widespread acceptance of these unconventional looking fruits and vegetables, thereby contributing to the reduction of food waste on a broader scale. The Nutritional Value of Unconventional Vegetables It's important to note that the appearance of a vegetable does not correlate to its nutritional value. Unconventional looking produce is just as healthy and nutritious as its more \\"visually pleasing\\" counterparts. By embracing imperfect fruits and vegetables, consumers will be able to enjoy a healthy, balanced diet while simultaneously reducing food waste. Conclusion Gardener Keith Rogers' idea of selling misshapen and imperfect vegetables at half price in supermarkets has the potential to make a significant impact on food waste and society's overall attitude toward produce. By addressing this issue, we could not only eliminate excessive food waste but also change the perception of what constitutes as a \\"good\\" fruit or vegetable. It's time for us to reconsider our standards for produce and be open to embracing the odd-looking vegetables that are just as nutritious and delicious as their conventional counterparts. So, next time you're at the grocery store, consider reaching for that quirky shaped carrot or that lumpy heirloom tomato - who knows, you might find that they're more interesting and flavorful than their \\"perfect\\" counterparts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What camp used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge? from the following article ?  The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building.

In the question, there are two sources of disturbance: the dolphin jumping out of the water and falling back in, and the turtle flapping its fin. Step 3: Compare the energies of the disturbances. Dolphin's disturbing the water through its jump and fall generates more energy than a turtle's fin flap. Step 4: Determine the amplitude based on energy.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it.

Much of her work was published in The New Age under a variety of pseudonyms , and she lived with the editor , A. R. Orage , for a time before the outbreak of the First World War . Bisexual , she was a friend and lover of Katherine Mansfield , whose work was first published in The New Age . Another of her lovers was Wyndham Lewis . Born in London and raised in South Africa , just before the war , she moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with Max Jacob . She shared an apartment in Montparnasse with Amedeo Modigliani and posed for him as well . Another friend was adventure novelist Charles Beadle , with whom she had several things in common . He grew up in Hackney , spent time in South Africa ( participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police ) , and published several novels about bohemian life in Paris . When Beadle came to America , from Paris , in November 1916 , he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris . Towards the end of her life she felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due , and blamed Orage , whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain , and she published a pamphlet , The Old New Age , bitterly criticising him in 1936 . In 1943 , probably suffering from cancer , she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker .  - Philip Mairet (full name: Philippe Auguste Mairet; 18861975) was a designer, writer and journalist. He had a wide range of interest: crafts, Alfred Adler and psychiatry, and Social Credit. He was also a translator of major figures including Sartre. He wrote biographies of Sir Patrick Geddes and A. R. Orage, with both of whom he was closely associated.  - The New Age was a British literary magazine, noted for its wide influence under the editorship of A. R. Orage from 1907 to 1922. It began life in 1894 as a publication of the Christian Socialist movement; but in 1907 as a radical weekly edited by Joseph Clayton, it was struggling. In May of that year, Alfred Orage and Holbrook Jackson, who had been running the Leeds Arts Club, took over the journal with financial help from George Bernard Shaw. Jackson acted as co-editor only for the first year, after which Orage edited it alone until he sold it in 1922. By that time his interests had moved towards mysticism, and the quality and circulation of the journal had declined. According to a Brown University press release, \\"\\"The New Age\\" helped to shape modernism in literature and the arts from 1907 to 1922\\". It ceased publication in 1938. Orage was also associated with \\"The New English Weekly\\" (193249) as editor during its first two years of operation (Philip Mairet took over at his death in 1934).  - Kathleen Mansfield Murry (nee Beauchamp; 14 October 1888  9 January 1923) was a prominent New Zealand modernist short story writer who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under the pen name of Katherine Mansfield. At 19, Mansfield left New Zealand and settled in the United Kingdom, where she became a friend of modernist writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf. In 1917 she was diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which led to her death at the age of 34.  - George Holbrook Jackson (31 December 1874  16 June 1948) was a British journalist, writer and publisher. He was recognised as one of the leading bibliophiles of his time.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Adeline Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882  28 March 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century.  - Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 190911, revised and expanded in 191415 and first serialized in the magazine \\"The Egoist\\" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women, and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regardsespecially in its English formas a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are, ironically, a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis's own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler.  - The Leeds Arts Club was founded in 1903 by the Leeds school teacher Alfred Orage and Yorkshire textile manufacture Holbrook Jackson, and was probably one of the most advanced centres for modernist thinking in Britain in the pre-First World War period.   - Percy Wyndham Lewis (18 November 1882  7 March 1957) was an English painter and critic (he dropped the name 'Percy', which he disliked). He was a co-founder of the Vorticist movement in art, and edited the literary magazine of the Vorticists, \\"BLAST\\". His novels include his pre-World War I-era novel \\"Tarr\\" (set in Paris), and \\"The Human Age\\", a trilogy comprising \\"The Childermass\\" (1928), \\"Monstre Gai\\" and \\"Malign Fiesta\\" (both 1955), set in the afterworld. A fourth volume of \\"The Human Age\\", \\"The Trial of Man,\\" was begun by Lewis but left in a fragmentary state at the time of his death. He also wrote two autobiographical volumes, \\"Blasting and Bombardiering\\" (1937) and \\"Rude Assignment: A Narrative of my Career Up-to-Date\\" (1950).

Context: U.S. lawmakers grilled Trump administration officials Tuesday about the war in Afghanistan, saying the new White House strategy was inconsistent and was not producing results. The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy.

Given the question: You are given a new situation: Ned learned about reactions at a higher temperature for his physics class, while Paul had to learn about reactions at lower temperatures.  and a hint : When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures.  Please answer this question : Which person studied about particles of reactants having less energy? The answer is:","output":"Paul. Justification: The question asks about the person who studied about particles of reactants having less energy.  From the information provided in the hint, it is clear that particles of reactants have less energy at lower temperatures. This is because the rate of the reaction slows down due to lesser movement and collisions among particles. This scenario accurately describes a situation of lower temperatures.

Summarize the following: Making mascara out of clay is quick and only requires a few ingredients and tools. To make your own homemade mascara from clay, you will need:  5 teaspoons (25 g) clay (of your color choice) 1 ¾ teaspoon (10.5 ml) water 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 ml) vegetable glycerin 1 pinch guar gum a small bowl a spoon Take a pinch of guar gum and put it into the bowl. The guar gum will act as a thickener and stabilizer for the mascara. Then, measure out five teaspoons of the clay of your choice. You can also mix the colors to create your own unique shade. The clay will provide the color, and will help the mascara to dry easily.  Choose a clay that has the color you are looking for n a mascara. Popular clay choices include:  Bentonite clay mixed with cocoa powder for color (for more of a brown mascara) Australian red reef clay (for a reddish brown mascara) Australian black clay (for a black mascara) When you have mixed the two powders together, add in the liquid ingredients. Measure out 1 ¾ teaspoons of water and 1/4 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin. Stir the ingredients until they are well combined.  If you're having trouble stirring the ingredients together, add more water in small increments, such as a drop or two at a time, until you get a thick, smooth liquid. It's important that you don't add too much water, or the mascara will be  runny and you won't be able to apply it. Since this mascara doesn't really have any preservatives, it's important that you replace it every four to six months. This will prevent bacteria from growing and spreading onto your lashes.

Mazzia was born on February 17, 1922, and passed away on March 10, 1999. To determine his age at the time of his death, we must calculate the difference between these two dates. Mazzia's birth year is 1922, and his death year is 1999. Year difference: 1999 - 1922 = 77 years. To account for months and days, we need to consider that Mazzia was born in February and died in March. Assuming each month has 30 days, let us calculate the days left in February and the days passed in March: Days left in February: 30 (days in a month) - 17 (birth date) = 13 days. Days passed in March: 10 (death date). Now, let's add up the days: 13 (days left in February) + 10 (days in March) = 23 days. As there are 30 days in a month, the total number of days (23) is less than one month. From this, we can conclude that Mazzia was 77 years old at the time of his death, which contradicts the statement claiming he was less than 70 years old."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Isbell was born in Green Hill, Alabama, two miles from the Alabama/Tennessee state line, the son of interior designer mother Angela Hill Barnett and house painter Mike Isbell. Isbell's mother was only 17 years old (and his father 19 years old) when he was born and is the subject of a song, \\"Children of Children\\". Isbell's parents divorced, and he has two much younger half-siblings, Chantry Barnett and Emily Isbell. Isbell grew up in rural North Alabama. Context: Jason Isbell released his first solo album, Sirens of the Ditch, on July 10, 2007. In 2012, Isbell supported singer-songwriter Ryan Adams on his tour. Both played solo acoustic sets.  On June 11, 2013, Isbell released his fourth solo album, Southeastern. Produced by Dave Cobb and featuring accompanying vocals by Kim Richey and Isbell's wife, Amanda Shires, Southeastern received overwhelmingly positive critical reviews, earning a score of 87 on Metacritic. Southeastern led to Isbell's clean sweep of the 2014 Americana Music Awards. Southeastern won Album of the Year, Isbell was named Artist of the Year, and the song \\"Cover Me Up\\" was named Song of the Year. NPR rock critic Ken Tucker listed Southeastern at No. 1 on his top ten albums of 2013. Isbell's record received praise by artists like Bruce Springsteen and John Prine. Isbell's music video for the song \\"Traveling Alone\\" features the Jackson House, a historic home in Moulton, Alabama. In 2014, his song \\"Cover Me Up\\" was used as the weather for the Welcome to Night Vale episode \\"Visitor\\".  Isbell's fifth solo record, Something More Than Free, was released on July 17, 2015, on Southeastern Records. Dave Cobb produced, continuing the partnership created with Isbell on Southeastern. They recorded the album at Nashville's Sound Emporium studio with a full band. During the summer of 2015, Isbell was on a North American tour to promote the album, with four consecutive sold-out nights at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville at the end of October. In April 2016, Isbell appeared on the BBC live-music show Later With Jools Holland, singing \\"The Life You Chose\\", one of the tracks from Something More Than Free.  Isbell said that compared to Southeastern, Something More Than Free has a feeling of celebration, which reflects his upcoming fatherhood and a forward-facing momentum. One track on the record, \\"To a Band I Loved\\", is a love-letter to the band Centro-Matic, a now defunct band from Denton, Texas, Isbell played with back in his Drive-By Truckers days.  Something More Than Free debuted at number 1 on Billboard Magazine's rock, folk and country record charts. Although Isbell had had critical success in the Americana genre, this was the first time he received such high ranking across genres. The album was well received, winning two Grammy awards for Best Americana Album and Best American Roots Song (\\"24 Frames\\").

Dakkari Dijon McAnuff was booked on suspicion of making criminal threats, police said last week. The investigation began last Wednesday morning when police officers were notified about a photo on Twitter. Scroll down for video. A 20-year-old man in LA is accused of vowing to trade retweets on Twitter for a murder. He posted this terrifying image of a rifle with a scope sticking out a window. It showed a rifle pointed at a Los Angeles street with the caption: '100 (retweets) and I'll shoot someone walking.' Investigators say they were able to link McAnuff to the Twitter account and track it to a home in the downtown area, where he was arrested on Wednesday. Police later determined the weapon was an air rifle, which was recovered from the home. McAnuff's Twitter account @stillDMC has since been taken down. However archived tweets revealed that he had also posted: 'Man Down. Mission Completed.' There is no indication that any shots were fired or anyone was injured. McAnuff is being held on 50,000 bail.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Molly and Brian are two friends who moved away from one another after becoming close in college. They still talk on the phone regularly and see each other a couple times a year. During a recent conversation, the subject of population comes up. Molly's town is currently increasing a steady decrease in population, and Brian's town has been seeing an increase in population.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   An Allee effect is not currently happening in which town?  Hint: Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led... A:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, an Allee effect is not currently happening in Brian's town. This is because Brian's town is experiencing an increase in population, which means that the population is not declining, and therefore, there is less likelihood of a loss of genetic diversity or associated issues like genetic drift and inbreeding depression that contribute to an Allee effect. On the contrary, Molly's town is facing a steady decrease in population, which may increase the chances of an Allee effect occurring due to the factors previously mentioned."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The second question asks about the number of people arrested in Germany since the end of WWII for Nazi-related reasons. This question is focused on post-WWII accountability, legal actions, and the ongoing efforts to address the crimes committed by individuals during the Nazi era. To answer this question, one would need to research specific data and statistics, such as: - Total number of arrests related to Nazi war crimes, Holocaust denial, and glorification of the Nazi era. - Notable cases and trials of individuals arrested for Nazi-related reasons. - The role of German courts and law enforcement in addressing Nazi-related crimes.

Math problem: Solve 29*a - 52*a - 24*a = 130*a - 1770 for a. What is the solution?","output":"Let's break down the algebra step by step. The equation that you've provided is: 29*a - 52*a - 24*a = 130*a - 1770 We can simplify both sides of this equation by collecting like terms. By doing so, we simply add or subtract the coefficients (the numbers being multiplied by 'a'). On the left-hand side, we have 29a - 52a - 24a, which simplifies to: 29a - 52a - 24a = -47a So the equation now reads as -47a = 130a - 1770. Let's now isolate 'a' terms on one side of the equation and constant terms on another side. For that, we will move -47a to the right side of the equation by adding 47a to both sides: -47a+47a = 130a - 1770 + 47a This simplifies to: 0 = 177a - 1770 Now, let's move 1770 to the other side of the equation by adding 1770 to both sides: 0 + 1770 = 177a - 1770 + 1770 This gives us: 1770 = 177a Finally, to solve for 'a', we can divide both sides of the equation by 177: 1770 / 177 = 177a / 177 Therefore, the solution is: a = 10 So the value of 'a' that satisfies the equation is 10."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In both cases, the division of power balances the decision-making process and prevents any single institution from dominating the others. In the historical context of the Kingdom of Poland and Kingdom of Hungary, power was primarily divided among the monarchy, nobility, and sometimes the clergy. The political systems in these kingdoms evolved over time and were influenced by their relationships with neighboring countries and empires. In some periods, power was more centralized in the hands of the monarch, while in other periods, it was more dispersed among the nobility and other powerful groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Gays and lesbians who adopt children are ‘recruiting’ them to their cause claims evangelist Franklin Graham in his latest outspoken remarks about homosexuality. Graham caused controversy last week when he praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for protecting children from gay 'propaganda' in a column in the March edition of Decision magazine. In an interview published on YouTube on Tuesday Graham said - rather inaccurately – that gays and lesbians can’t have children. Scroll down for video. Evangelist Franklin Graham has spoken out again against homosexuals and said that those that adopt children are trying to 'recruit' them to join their lifestyle. ‘Of course, gays and lesbians cannot have children,’ he told the Charlotte Observer. When it was pointed out that homosexual couples can adopt children, Graham responded: ‘They can recruit. You can adopt a child into a marriage, but you can also recruit children into your cause. 'I believe in protecting children from exploitation – all exploitations.’ Graham, who is the son of famous evangelical Christian evangelist Billy Graham, claimed he was only saying what his father would say if he were a younger man and in better health. ‘You talk about controversy – my father stood with Martin Luther King in the early 1960s,’ Graham said. Man of God: Franklin Graham thinks Putin is doing a far better job protecting people from the homosexual influence then that lax and 'shameful' views of Obama. ‘My father never worried about polls. I don’t care about them, either. And with the issues we are facing today – if my father were a younger man, he would be addressing and speaking out in the exact same way I’m speaking out on them.’ Billy Graham is bedridden at his Montreat home after taking ill following his 95th birthday party last November. 'He’s very, very weak,' said Graham. Franklin Graham has been accused by his critics of steering the Charlotte-based Billy Graham Evangelistic Association away from his father's later-in-life emphasis on a loving God towards a conservative political agenda. In his column in Decision magazine, Graham praises Putin as better than President Obama whose embrace of gay rights he said was 'shameful.' 'In my opinion, Putin is right on these issues,' Graham wrote. 'Obviously, he may be wrong about many things, but he has taken a stand to protect his nation's children from the damaging effects of any gay and lesbian agenda. 'Our president,' he continued, 'and his attorney general have turned their backs on God and His standards, and many in the Congress are following the administration's lead. This is shameful.' Generations: The elder evangelist Billy Graham (pictured here with son Franklin) once called communism a tool of Satan but softened in his later years. Putin was widely criticized by gay rights activists for persecuting homosexuals in his country in the days leading up to the Winter Olympics. Obama even included openly gay athletes in the U.S. delegation to Sochi in response. While Graham hedged his bets by noting that 'I am not endorsing President Putin,' he still praised his treatment of homosexuals as a deviant, outright dangerous group. 'Isn't it sad, though, that America's own morality has fallen so far that on this issues -- protecting children from any homosexual agenda or propaganda -- Russia's standard is higher than our own?' Graham also took sides in the ongoing civil war in Syria, backing the macho Russian leader's interests as an ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad. 'Syria,  for all. its problems, at least has a constitution that guarantees equal. protection of citizens,' Graham wrote. 'Around the world, we have seen. that this is essential where Christians are a minority and are not. protected. …Christians in Syria know that if the radicals overthrow. Assad, there will be widespread persecution and wholesale slaughter of. Christians.' Hard heart: Putin has been criticized for denying homosexuals basic human rights. Graham's father, evangelist Billy Graham, once called communism a 'religion that is inspired, directed, and motivated by the Devil himself who has declared war against Almighty God.' However he softened his fire-and-brimstone critique in his later years. 'If I had it to do over again, I would avoid any semblance of involvement in partisan politics,' he wrote in his 1997 autobiography, 'Just As I am.' Franklin Graham's comments have even angered some religious leaders who note that some gay Russians have been beaten, stabbed, and even killed. 'It's really disturbing when a religious leader seems to endorse laws that lead to this kind of behavior,' Marianne Duddy-Burke, head of the gay Catholic group DignityUSA, to the Huffington Post. Franklin Graham hopes that his family's time in Russia long ago may have influenced a young Putin while the future president was an agent for the KGB in 1982. 'In fact, he was in charge. of monitoring foreigners in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) when my. father preached there in 1984,' Franklin Graham. 'If he was. eavesdropping on our meeting, which I hope he was, he heard the Gospel!' Video: 'Gays and lesbians can't have children,' says Franklin Graham.

The Indianapolis Colts began their 2011 season at Reliant Stadium against the Houston Texans.  For the first time since the 1998 season, Peyton Manning was not under the helm at quarterback and it was recently acquired Kerry Collins that would take his position.  The game started very well for the Colts, opening up with an interception by Melvin Bullitt that allowed the Colts to take control.  However, a three and out from the offense quickly gave the Texans the ball to drive down and score a field goal and take a 3-0 lead.  Collins and the Colts offense was out of sync for much of the first quarter, fumbling two snaps and giving Houston the great field position inside of the Indianapolis 40-yard line.  After the first quarter, the Texans held a commanding 17-0 lead and were firing on all cylinders.  The second quarter continued Houston's dominance, with all three teams of the Colts failing to stop or to execute against the Texans.  At halftime, the Colts trailed Houston 34-0, the largest deficit in the entire 58-year history of the franchise.  The second half saw little action with both teams taking shorter drives and in some senses, running down the clock.

Adam is a MBA student at Harvard University. He studies long hours, gets very little sleep and as a result, he drinks a lot of coffee---anywhere from five to six cups a day. Recently, Adam felt that drinking thus much coffee was making it hard for him to sleep at all. He also began having problems with his concentration , and complained of stomachaches. Adam's doctor made this suggestions: stop drinking coffee altogether. When Adam got up on October 3, he began his day without his morning coffee. By 11:00 a.m., Adam was in a terrible mood  . He was tired and had a headache. At 11:30, he had a meeting with his student advisor. In the meeting, he found it almost impossible to continue. What was going on? Caffeine, a chemical found in coffee, was most likely the reason for how Adam felt. Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts  energy levels and improves concentration- but only for a short time. Lowering caffeine consumption  often causes a drop in blood pressure and the result is a \\"coffee headache\\", People who stop drinking coffee often say they feel tired and moody, and find it hard to focus. The good news is that these feeling usually pass after four and five days. During this time, doctors suggested taking some aspirin for the headache.

Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other.

Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America.  - William M. Kelso, C.B.E., Ph. D., F.S.A. (born 1941), often referred to as Bill Kelso, is an American archaeologist specializing in Virginia's colonial period, particularly the Jamestown colony.  - The Virginia Company refers collectively to two joint stock companies chartered by James I on 10 April 1606 with the purposes of establishing settlements on the coast of North America. The two companies, called the \\"Virginia Company of London\\" (or the London Company) and the \\"Virginia Company of Plymouth\\" (or Plymouth Company) operated with identical charters but with differing territories. An area of overlapping territory was created within which the two companies were not permitted to establish colonies within one hundred miles of each other. The Plymouth Company never fulfilled its charter, and its territory that later became New England was at that time also claimed by England.  - The Colony of Virginia (also known frequently as the Virginia Colony, the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia or His Majesty's Most Ancient Colloney and Dominion of Virginia) was the first permanently settled English colony in North America. Newfoundland, with seasonal settlements, had been established as a colony by Royal Charter in 1583. American archaeologist William Kelso says Virginia \\"is where the British Empire began ... this was the first colony in the British Empire.\\" The colony existed briefly during the 16th century, and then continuously from 1607 until the American Revolution (as a British colony after 1707). The name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed \\"The Old Dominion\\" by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Commonwealth of England.  - Christopher Newport (15611617) was an English seaman and privateer. He is best known as the captain of the \\"Susan Constant\\", the largest of three ships which carried settlers for the Virginia Company in 1607 on the way to found the settlement at Jamestown in the Virginia Colony, which became the first permanent English settlement in North America. He was also in overall command of the other two ships on that initial voyage, in order of their size, the \\"Godspeed\\" and the \\"Discovery\\".  - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.  - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.  - Susan Constant , captained by Christopher Newport , was the largest of three ships of the English Virginia Company ( the others being Discovery and Godspeed ) on the 1606 -- 1607 voyage that resulted in the founding of Jamestown in the new Colony of Virginia .

Q:I can use this background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature...  Now, I have a new situation: Frank and Noah were two researchers.

He researched the climate of Antarctica, where the study mentioned that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Austronesian languages are spoken by about 386 million people, making it the fifth-largest language family by number of speakers, behind only the Indo-European languages, the Sino-Tibetan languages, the Niger-Congo languages, and the Afroasiatic languages. It is on par with Indo-European, NigerCongo, and Afroasiatic as one of the best-established language families. Major Austronesian languages with the highest number of speakers are Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Javanese, and Filipino (Tagalog). If we make a ranking base on the number of languages in Austronesian languages, then this language family will be the second largest language family in the world, which contains 1,257 languages in total.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - The Dayak Unity Party ( Indonesian : Partai Persatuan Dayak , PPD ) was a political party in Indonesia .

Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"In a shaded area, the wood's finish will be affected less when rain evaporates. The supposed perturbation of being in a shaded area will have a lessening effect on the second effect mentioned, which is the finish of the wood being taken with the evaporating rain. This is because a shaded area will have less direct sunlight, causing the evaporation process to be slower, giving the finish more time to adhere back to the wood surface. Additionally, a shaded area may experience slightly higher humidity, which also slows the evaporation process. Overall, the shaded environment will cause a lesser effect on the wood's finish compared to being in direct sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Teenage girls are increasingly looking at fitness bloggers on Instagram and Facebook as role models but it is making them feel guilty that their bodies don't match up, new research shows. Associate Professor Claire Drummond from Flinders University set out to study what motivates or discourages girls aged 13 to 17 to do physical activity.

Plot title: Empire Records Movie plot: Empire Records is an independent record shop managed by Joe (Anthony LaPaglia). The store is located in a fictional city in Delaware, and, like its employees, is eclectic and unique. The staff is very much a surrogate family, with Joe as the reluctant and perpetually exasperated but loveable father figure. When his young staff experience problems in their personal lives, he routinely reminds them they can seek him out for advice. The film opens with store manager Joe allowing employee Lucas (Rory Cochrane) his first opportunity to close the store, an opportunity Lucas regards as an honour. While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas snoops and discovers that Empire Records is about to be bought and converted into a branch of Music Town, a large national music store with many franchises. In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling 9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling. Lucas believes this act will create enough money to allow Joe to save Empire Records. Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table. Instead of going home he sleeps on his motorcycle outside the store, where he is found the following morning by opening manager A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) and fellow employee Mark (Ethan Embry). He confides in the pair about the previous night's events before riding away, seemingly for good. Joe arrives to help open the store and quickly receives phone calls from both the bank and the store owner, Mitchell Beck (Ben BodÃ©), regarding the previous night's missing deposit.

The review highlights certain positive aspects of the product, such as it being easy to read and very interesting. The user mentions that they wish the product included pictures to accompany the author's descriptions, but this does not seem to detract significantly from their overall enjoyment of the product. While the user does not explicitly answer \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" in this case, the overall tone of their review suggests that they found enough value in the product to potentially recommend it to others. It is essential to consider that individual recommendations are subjective and influenced by the unique experiences and preferences of the reviewer. However, the fact that the reviewer found the product both interesting and easy to read may appeal to a broader audience, implying that the recommendation could be representative of the preferences of a wider group of people. Additionally, the user's desire for pictures to accompany the text suggests that there is room for improvement in the product. This feedback could be used to enhance the product's existing content, potentially making it even more attractive to potential consumers. If the product were to be updated with images in the future, it would be prudent to revisit this user's recommendation to determine whether the addition would indeed result in a more robust endorsement. In conclusion, while the user does not explicitly state their recommendation, the positive points they mention in their review suggest that they would likely recommend the product.

To the owners: Help them help you.  And i'm afraid that's it for the positives.  The bad: Generally speaking it feels like no one is in charge or that this is the first time the owners have run a restaurant.   When you first arrive you are left to find your own seat. That works in some places, but Pallets needs a host stand and a host(ess). This will give a level of defense between the uncontrolled steady stream of customers and the overworked wait staff. It also communicates an element of control over the situation to the customers. When you tell me to sit anywhere I want, you might think it gives me some independence in my decision, but it's just forcing me to work against your broken system to find the least inconvenient seat.  Which brings me to my next suggestion: more wait staff and clearly defined sections. Each time I've been there the staff seems like they're managing the entire restaurant. And while I appreciate a team approach (much like Windsor) I never got the feeling that any one server was owning my table's experience.   The kitchen. Each time I've eaten at Pallets I've dined with a companion and each time one dish comes up significantly earlier than the other. And each time the runner had no idea who ordered what.

Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 there was no policeman in London at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night, and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago, London started to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people had to stay in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called \\"Bow Street Runners\\" because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. There was no policewoman in London until 1920. Today, London police are quite well paid and only a few police officers still ride horses. Perhaps the London Police Force's greatest achievement   is to meet changing  conditions and provide excellent police service  .

A person who wishes to appear youngish, pure and innocent dresses in white, like the choice of a bride's wedding gown. Also clothed in white are doctors, dentists, nurses and hospital in-patients as the color1 expresses comfort, cleanliness and professionalism. Brown, blue or grey clothes are the usual color1s worn by office workers so as not to draw unnecessary attention to them. They are, in a way, conveying the message that they want to be noticed for their work, not their appearance. People who wear bright, strong color1s like to be attractive and these color1s are particularly popular with actresses, singers and party goers.

Your best chance of doing this is to draw the attention of a passing plane. Body signals Pilots from different countries understand body signals if they have the correct training, When you wave your arms up and down in a straight line, it means, \\"yes\\". When you point downwards and swing your arm from side to side, it means \\"no\\". If you want the pilot to know that it's safe to land, push your hands out in front of you and bend your knees. If you want to say that it's not safe to land, put your arms in the air and move them to one side. Smoke signals The smoke from a fire can be seen from far away, so it's a good way to draw attention. If the weather is dry, it isn't hard to start a fire. Remember, however, that fires can be very dangerous if they get out of control. Never light a tire unless you're sure that it can't spread. If the ground is dark, light smoke can be seen more easily. Green grass and leaves produce light smoke. Ground-to-air signals It's a good idea lo build some signals, too.

Female huskies aren't ready to breed until they are 2 years old or older. Don't breed her until she has her second heat cycle. She'll probably have her first heat cycle at 5 to 7 months, but her body isn't mature enough for breeding at that time. Male dogs are mature after about 6 months. The stud dog only needs to perform one job (getting the bitch pregnant), but the bitch must carry the puppies to term and care for them when they are young. A calm female dog is more likely to be a good mother to the pups. Using a female with an aggressive temperament can result in unhealthy or aggressive puppies. If maintaining a pure husky bloodline is important to you, both dogs should be registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC), the Continental Kennel Club (CKC) or the United Kennel Club (UKC).  Both dogs need to be registered with the same club in order for the puppies to be eligible for registration. Research the bloodlines of both dogs to learn about potential health problems or temperament issues. Try running a Google search using key words like \\"husky bloodlines\\" and \\"breeding husky bloodlines.\\" You can also visit http://siberian-husky-bloodlines.seppalasleddogs.com/index.htm. Both dogs should have a thorough veterinary check-up about a month before breeding begins. Get them up-to-date on vaccinations and make sure they're free from parasites. Have them screened for brucellosis, which is a disease that can cause infertility.  It's also a good idea to ask the vet to screen both dogs for evidence of hip dysplasia. The bitch should have good muscle tone and should not be overweight. Genetic disorders of the eyes are common in huskies. These disorders can appear at any age, so it is important to have your dogs' eyes checked once a year. Have a screening performed on both dogs prior to breeding.

Question: How does Najaf break his leg? Title: Baran Movie plot: It is winter in Teheran. Lateef is 17. He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her.

Translate to English","output":"Products designed to dissolve reactive adhesives from a range of substrates, or labeled as such. Reactive adhesives are a type of glue that cures, sets, or bonds through chemical reactions rather than the evaporation of a solvent. They are commonly used in a variety of industries due to their strong bonding capabilities and can adhere to a wide range of substrates, including metals, plastics, and rubbers. Adhesive dissolution products are specifically formulated to break down the chemical bonds within reactive adhesives, effectively removing the substance from various surfaces. This can be crucial for applications where aesthetic appearance is important, or where a strong bond between materials needs to be reversed without damaging the substrates themselves. Many of these adhesive dissolution products are labeled as such and marketed directly towards industries or consumers seeking a solution to remove reactive adhesives. In general, these products usually consist of different blends of solvents, surfactants, and other additives that are designed to effectively break down the adhesive materials. When using an adhesive dissolution product to remove a reactive adhesive from a substrate, the following steps should typically be taken: 1. Identify the type of adhesive in use in order to select the appropriate dissolution product. This may involve consulting product labels, manufacturer recommendations, or technical data sheets. 2. Apply the dissolution product to the adhesive material, following the manufacturer's instructions for use. This may involve spraying, brushing, or immersing the substrate in the dissolution product. 3. Allow the dissolution product to penetrate and react with the adhesive material, which may take several minutes to hours, depending on the strength of the adhesive, the particular dissolution product used, and ambient temperatures. 4. After the adhesive has been softened or dissolved, carefully remove the residual adhesive material from the substrate by scraping, wiping, or using a specialized removal tool. 5. Clean the substrate thoroughly to ensure no residue is left behind, which may involve using additional cleaning or rinsing agents as needed. 6. Inspect the surface of the substrate for any remaining adhesive or damage and evaluate its suitability for future use or re-adhesion. 7. Properly dispose of the used adhesive dissolution product according to local regulations and environmental guidelines. In conclusion, adhesive dissolution products, or products labeled as such, are specifically developed to help dissolve or remove reactive adhesives from a range of substrates. These products can be invaluable tools for professionals and consumers alike, allowing for the effective removal of otherwise difficult-to-remove adhesive materials, ensuring clean and undamaged surfaces for future use."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plots within the horror genre often involve the intrusion of an evil force, event, or personage into the everyday world. Prevalent elements include ghosts, aliens, vampires, werewolves, demons, satanism, gore, torture, vicious animals, evil witches, monsters, zombies, cannibals, psychopaths, natural or man-made disasters, and serial killers.  Some subgenres of horror include action horror, comedy horror, body horror, disaster horror, holiday horror, horror drama, psychological horror, science fiction horror, slasher horror, supernatural horror, gothic horror, natural horror, zombie horror, first-person horror and teen horror.  The first depictions of supernatural events appear in several of the silent shorts created by the film pioneer Georges Méliès in the late 1890s, the best known being \\"Le Manoir du Diable\\", which is sometimes credited as being the first horror film. Another of his horror projects was \\"La Caverne maudite\\" (1898) (a.k.a. \\"The Cave of the Demons\\", literally \\"the accursed cave\\"). Japan made early forays into the horror genre with \\"Bake Jizo\\" (\\"Jizo the Spook\\") and \\"Shinin no Sosei\\" (\\"Resurrection of a Corpse\\"), both made in 1898. The era featured a slew of literary adaptations, adapting the works of Poe and Dante, among others. In 1908, Selig Polyscope Company produced \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\".

Write a title for this article: Over 60% of parents believed that the introduction of 'tougher' exams will either make no difference or make standards worse. Photograph: Christopher Thomond Nearly three-quarters of parents worry that the pace of change in schools damages their child's education and are sceptical that academies and free schools will improve matters, a survey conducted on behalf of the National Association of Head Teachers has found. The survey of 1,000 parents in England, Wales and Northern Ireland found 73% agreed that pressures on schools to implement new initiatives in a short time could harm their child's education and 71% believed that academies and free schools will not raise standards. A further 62% of parents believed that the government's introduction of \\"tougher\\" exams at GCSE and A-level will either make no difference or make standards worse. The findings back a call by the NAHT, holding its annual conference in Birmingham this weekend, for a slow down in the pace of change being imposed by government as well as \\"time out\\" from Ofsted inspections to give schools time to deal with changes to exams, assessment and curriculum. Russell Hobby, the general secretary of NAHT, said that by September this year schools in England will have to introduce new safeguarding advice for staff, ensure they comply with new freedom of information rules, make decisions on new pay policies, adopt new codes of practice for special needs pupils, introduce a new curriculum, redesign assessment and – in primary schools – be ready to offer free school meals. \\"Some of these new initiatives are sensible ideas but all at the same time?\\" Hobby said. \\"Our education system is not perfect and most school leaders recognise the need for reform. They want that reform to be planned well in advance, focused on the highest priorities and scheduled sensibly throughout a parliamentary term.\\" Meanwhile, in Wales the education minister Huw Lewis announced a new programme named Schools Challenge Cymru, based on the successful London Challenge begun in 2003 to tackle underperformance in the capital's state schools. The programme is to focus on supporting 40 schools across Wales at a cost of £20m, and will be overseen by Professor Mel Ainscow, the former chief adviser to the Manchester City Challenge that sought to spread best practice within the region. \\"The knowledge and expertise that is needed to improve already exists within the Welsh education system and we must exploit it. We must make the best practices available to all children and young people in Wales,\\" Lewis said.

You would be forgiven for thinking nobody could have walked away from this horrific crash. But 21-year-old Ashley Locker only suffered a broken arm and cuts and bruises after his silver MG ZR car ended up wrapped around a tree last Thursday morning in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The force of the impact meant Mr Locker was catapulted into the back of the car, still strapped in to his seat. But at 6ft 3in tall and weighing 18st, rescuers said his bulk was one reason he survived. Lucky escape: The wreckage of Ashley Locker's silver MG ZR after the crash in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. It was feared that both of his arms were broken and he may have suffered neck and spinal injuries, but his family said he escaped with only one broken arm, a wounded foot and cuts and bruises. His mother, Gill, 48, said: ‘He broke his right arm in two places and has had plates and screws put in. He also had an open wound on his foot which needed 11 stitches. Bruises: At 6ft 3in tall and weighing 18st, rescuers said Mr Locker's bulk was one reason he survived. ‘But other than that it was just cuts and bruises. He was very lucky.

Based on this information, it appears to be a rodeo event or a similar livestock handling activity. Step 2: Determine the most likely action As the person is swinging a rope while chasing a calf, it can be reasonably assumed that the person is attempting to catch the calf, likely by performing a technique called lassoing. Lassoing is a common practice in rodeos or cattle ranching, where a horse rider swings a rope with a loop at its end to catch animals at a distance. Step 3: Visualize the next action The most natural course of action that follows would involve the person attempting to successfully lasso the calf. This would involve the rider ensuring the rope is at an optimal length, accurately aiming the swing, and timing the release of the rope to catch the calf securely around its neck, legs, or horns, depending on the specific event or goal. Step 4: Predict the outcome of the action If the person successfully lassos the calf, they would then likely either bring the calf to a halt or guide it in a specific direction, depending on the particular event's rules or the intended purpose of catching the calf (e.g., for branding, medical treatment, or another practical reason). The spectators around the pit would likely react accordingly, either cheering in excitement, evaluating the rider's performance, or providing assistance, depending on their individual roles and involvement in the activity.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information:  - Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to, e.g., a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as \\"all people living in a country\\" or \\"every atom composing a crystal\\". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.  - An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis. Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists natural experimental studies.  - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.  - In statistics , a generalized additive model ( GAM ) is a generalized linear model in which the linear predictor depends linearly on unknown smooth functions of some predictor variables , and interest focuses on inference about these smooth functions . GAMs were originally developed by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani to blend properties of generalized linear models with additive models . The model relates a univariate response variable , Y , to some predictor variables , xi. An exponential family distribution is specified for Y ( for example normal , binomial or Poisson distributions ) along with a link function g ( for example the identity or log functions ) relating the expected value of Y to the predictor variables via a structure such as g (  operatorname ( E ) ( Y ) ) =  beta_0 + f_1 ( x_1 ) + f_2 ( x_2 ) +  cdots + f_m ( x_m ) .  ,  ! The functions fi ( xi ) may be functions with a specified parametric form ( for example a polynomial , or a coefficient depending on the levels of a factor variable ) or may be specified non-parametrically , or semi-parametrically , simply as ' smooth functions ' , to be estimated by non-parametric means . So a typical GAM might use a scatterplot smoothing function , such as a locally weighted mean , for f1 ( x1 ) , and then use a factor model for f2 ( x2 ) . This flexibility to allow non-parametric fits with relaxed assumptions on the actual relationship between response and predictor , provides the potential for better fits to data than purely parametric models , but arguably with some loss of interpretability .  - In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of actually existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population.  - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign.  - A statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process.  - In statistics, multicollinearity (also collinearity) is a phenomenon in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others.  - The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces (often with hundreds or thousands of dimensions) that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience. The expression was coined by Richard E. Bellman when considering problems in dynamic optimization.  - Nonparametric regression is a category of regression analysis in which the predictor does not take a predetermined form but is constructed according to information derived from the data. Nonparametric regression requires larger sample sizes than regression based on parametric models because the data must supply the model structure as well as the model estimates.  - Model selection is the task of selecting a statistical model from a set of candidate models, given data. In the simplest cases, a pre-existing set of data is considered. However, the task can also involve the design of experiments such that the data collected is well-suited to the problem of model selection. Given candidate models of similar predictive or explanatory power, the simplest model is most likely to be the best choice.  - A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e.g., its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items of the sample, which are known together as a set of data.  - In statistics and machine learning, one of the most common tasks is to fit a \\"model\\" to a set of training data, so as to be able to make reliable predictions on general untrained data. In overfitting, a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. Overfitting occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfit has poor predictive performance, as it overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data.  - In statistics, an additive model (AM) is a nonparametric regression method. It was suggested by Jerome H. Friedman and Werner Stuetzle (1981) and is an essential part of the ACE algorithm. The \\"AM\\" uses a one-dimensional smoother to build a restricted class of nonparametric regression models. Because of this, it is less affected by the curse of dimensionality than e.g. a \\"p\\"-dimensional smoother. Furthermore, the \\"AM\\" is more flexible than a standard linear model, while being more interpretable than a general regression surface at the cost of approximation errors. Problems with \\"AM\\" include model selection, overfitting, and multicollinearity.  - In statistics, the generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a \\"link function\\" and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. There are a number of symptoms, referred to as pre-syncope, that you may experience immediately before fainting. Most fainting spells occur when you are standing, and recognizing warning signs will help you prepare yourself if you do indeed faint. In addition, awareness can also help to prevent a fainting episode and will help you stay safe if you do faint. Common symptoms include yawning, a sudden sweat, nausea (sickness), fast and deep breathing, confusion, lightheadedness, blurred vision or spots in front of your eyes, and ringing in your ears. The symptoms of fainting can come on very quickly and with little warning. If you experience the above symptoms it is a good idea to conduct 'antigravity' measures, which when done immediately upon feeling symptoms, can help you avoid a fainting episode.  Medical experts suggest that you lie or sit down and place your head between your knees. These positions will help restore blood flow to the brain and can prevent a fainting episode.   If standing, you can also cross your legs and tightening your abdominal muscles. This is effective if you are in a crowded place and you are unable to lie down immediately. By preparing, you can ensure that you are in a safe and secure place when you faint.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What type of music was \\"Big Fun\\"? , can you please find it?   Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music which developed in the early and mid-1980s. One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three. Derrick May a.k.a. \\"MAYDAY\\" and Thomas Barnett released \\"Nude Photo\\" in 1987 on May's label \\"Transmat Records\\", which helped start the Detroit techno music scene. This record was played on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in Chicago clubs. A year later, Transmat released \\"Strings of Life\\". Transmat Records also released such as 1988's \\"Wiggin\\". As well, Derrick May had releases on Kool Kat Records and many remixes for underground and mainstream recording artists. Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno. These tracks were well received in Chicago and played on Chicago radio and in clubs.Blake Baxter's 1986 recording, \\"When we Used to Play / Work your Body\\", 1987's \\"Bounce Your Body to the Box\\" and \\"Force Field\\", \\"The Sound / How to Play our Music\\" and \\"the Groove that Won't Stop\\" and a remix of \\"Grooving Without a Doubt\\". In 1988, as house music became more popular among general audiences, Kevin Saunderson's group Inner City with Paris Gray released the 1988 hits \\"Big Fun\\" and \\"Good Life\\", which eventually were picked up by Virgin Records. Each EP / 12 inch single sported remixes by Mike \\"Hitman\\" Wilson and Steve \\"Silk\\" Hurley of Chicago and Derrick \\"Mayday\\" May and Juan Atkins of Detroit.

Chrisye agreed on condition that he be allowed creative freedom, to which Widjaja reluctantly agreed. In May 1978 Chrisye began work on his first album with Musica, Sabda Alam (Nature's Order), incorporating several songs by other artists and  some written by himself, including the title song. He recorded it after locking himself in the studio with the sound engineer and arranger; despite Amin's wanting to monitor their progress, Chrisye refused to allow him access. The album, greatly influenced by Badai Pasti Berlalu and drawing on the double tracking technique pioneered by the Beatles (in which the vocals are recorded twice to achieve fuller sound), was released in August that year. Heavily promoted in a campaign during which Chrisye was interviewed on the national television station TVRI and on radio, the album eventually sold 400,000 copies.The following year Chrisye recorded Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment) with Jockie. Produced after Amin's death, the album featured songs written by Chrisye's close friend Junaidi Salat, as well as Jockie and Guruh. The album's title was chosen by vote; the titular song was not released as a single. Percik Pesona, released in August 1979, was a critical and commercial failure. After discussing the issue with other artists, Chrisye blamed the album's failure on its similarity to Badai Pasti Berlalu. As a result, following a period of contemplation, he began branching out into different genres. That same year he was on the panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition, held on 5 May.After deciding that romantic pop songs influenced by easy listening would suit him best, Chrisye began recording his next album, Puspa Indah (Beautiful Flower). All but one of the songs were composed by Guruh Sukarnoputra; the album also featured the English-language \\"To My Friends on Legian..., what would be the answer ?

Given the background: Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Tim has Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, while Nate has the Epstein–Barr virus.  Answer the following question: Which cousin has a lower chance of  developing Kaposi's sarcoma?","output":"Based on the background information provided, Tim has Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Nate has the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of cancer that is caused by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). This virus is specifically linked to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma.  On the other hand, Epstein–Barr virus is a member of the Herpesviridae family and is associated with various types of cancers, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, Epstein–Barr virus is not directly linked to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma. Given this information, it can be concluded that Nate, who has the Epstein–Barr virus, has a lower chance of developing Kaposi's sarcoma as compared to Tim, who has the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. It is important to note that both cousins have chronic viral infections that are considered cancer-inducing viruses, but their risks for specific types of cancers differ based on the infection they carry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Incredible String Band (sometimes abbreviated as ISB) were a psychedelic folk band formed by Clive Palmer, Robin Williamson and Mike Heron in Scotland in 1966. The band built a considerable following, especially in the British counterculture, notably with their albums The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion, The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, and Wee Tam and the Big Huge. They became pioneers in psychedelic folk and, through integrating a wide variety of traditional music forms and instruments, in the development of world music. Following Palmer's early departure, Williamson and Heron performed as a duo, later augmented by other musicians. After that the group lasted another four years, although there was a gradual decline in their status and commercial success after 1970. Joe Boyd, whose skillful handling of the band had contributed much to their international success, stopped managing them and returned to the US. The group left Elektra Records and signed with Island, for whom they recorded five albums. The first was a soundtrack to the \\"Be Glad...\\" film, and this was followed by the eclectic Liquid Acrobat as Regards the Air, regarded as their best album for some time.  The band continued to tour and record. Rose Simpson left in 1971 and was replaced by Malcolm Le Maistre, formerly of the Stone Monkey troupe. Mike Heron took time out to record a well-received solo album, Smiling Men with Bad Reputations, which, in contrast to the ISB's self-contained productions, featured a host of session guests, among them Pete Townshend, Ronnie Lane, Keith Moon, John Cale and Richard Thompson. The following year, Licorice left, and was replaced by Gerard Dott, an Edinburgh jazz musician and friend of both Heron and Williamson who had contributed to Smiling Men. Williamson also recorded a solo album, Myrrh, which featured some of his most extraordinary vocal performances.  The group's changing lineup, adding Stan Schnier (aka \\"Stan Lee\\") on bass, Jack Ingram on drums, and Graham Forbes on electric guitar reflected moves toward a more conventional amplified rock group. Their final albums for Island were received disappointingly, and the label dropped them in 1974. By then, disagreements between Williamson and Heron about musical policy had become irreconcilable, and they split up in October 1974.

Sport fishermen keep tension on their lines to prevent hooked fish from releasing. A molecular version of this angler's trick, operating at kinetochores, ensures accuracy during mitosis: the mitotic spindle attaches randomly to chromosomes and then correctly bioriented attachments are stabilized due to the tension exerted on them by opposing microtubules. Incorrect attachments, which lack tension, are unstable and release quickly, allowing another chance for biorientation. Stabilization of molecular interactions by tension also occurs in other physiological contexts, such as cell adhesion, motility, hemostasis, and tissue morphogenesis. Here, we review models for the stabilization of kinetochore attachments with an eye toward emerging models for other force-activated systems. Although attention in the mitosis field has focused mainly on one kinase-based mechanism, multiple mechanisms may act together to stabilize properly bioriented kinetochores and some principles governing other tension-sensitive systems may also apply to kinetochores.

Summarize this article in one sentence. By improving your eating habits, you will decrease your body fat and fatigue, while gaining muscle and endurance. Not eating right could be what is holding you back from breaking your 800m record.  Eat a variety of wholesome foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. This will improve your body composition. Increase protein and the right amount of carbohydrates, as these will provide your body with the nutrients to build muscle and to give your body energy.  If you’re training for 30-45 minutes, shoot for about 3 grams (0.11 oz) of carbs on training days. If you’re training for 46-60 minutes, shoot for about 5 grams (0.18 oz) of carbs on training days.   Avoid processed high-sugar and high-sodium foods. These will hinder your body from running efficiently. Eat the right pre and post-workout carbohydrate-rich snacks. These should be consumed an hour before working out and within 30 minutes after a workout. Bananas, protein shakes and non-caffeinated energy bars are ideal. Your body needs about two liters on an average day to stay properly hydrated.On days when running, you need to drink extra water to compensate for your output and prevent yourself from slowing down. Don’t just chug extra water though; listen to your body and drink when thirsty.  Pre and post-workout hydration is vital. An hour before you start your run, try to drink about 16 ounces (450 g) of water. Drink the same amount of water after running. Look for signs of dehydration. Feeling thirsty or experiencing dry mouth, headaches, light-headedness, lack of urination and constipation are all the body's ways of letting you know that you are dehydrated. If you begin to experience any of these symptoms, it's best to increase your water intake. By stretching properly, you can improve your stride and your stride length (increasing your speed). Stretching before and after your workout will also help to prevent injury.  Muscles to stretch include your leg muscles (hamstrings, quadriceps and adductors) and your lower body (hip flexors and glutes). Try to add two or three longer stretch routines a week to your workout schedule.  Do some yoga to help you with your flexibility. You won’t be able to run a faster 800m in one day. Just like training for a marathon, the best way to achieve your goals is to set a schedule. By following a training plan you can perform at a peak performance, even when running a shorter distance.  Set an end date and work backward. Even with an 800m run, pick a date that you want to accomplish this run with your best time ever. Do one or two quality and intense workouts a week. These include running hills or tempo runs. Pick rest days where you can do some other sort of moderate exercise like yoga to stay limber. Ensure that you get enough sleep before the race.","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of proper nutrition, hydration, stretching, and following a training plan to improve your 800m record by enhancing muscle strength, endurance, and body composition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - wisconsin - countryside - fields - front yard - backyard  The answer is \\"front yard\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer \\"front yard\\" is appropriate because a large personal apple tree can typically be found in a residential area within the homeowner's property boundaries. Apple trees are not only grown for their fruits but also for their ornamental value. In this case, the front yard could be an ideal location for a homeowner to plant and showcase a beautiful apple tree. However, it is important to note that all the options provided can potentially be correct answers, depending on the context and preferences of the tree owner. Here's why: 1. Wisconsin: Apple trees can thrive in Wisconsin, as the state has a suitable climate for growing various apple varieties. Hence, a large personal apple tree might be found in Wisconsin. 2. Countryside: Countryside areas provide ample space for planting and growing large trees. A person living in the countryside might have a spacious yard or nearby fields where they could plant an apple tree. 3. Fields: If someone owns a field or land, they might choose to plant an apple tree there. Fields often have the advantage of open space and sunlight, which are essential for apple trees to grow. 4. Backyard: Similar to the front yard, a backyard is another common location for planting a large personal apple tree. Some homeowners may prefer to grow their apple tree in the backyard for privacy or to take advantage of better growing conditions, such as sunlight and soil quality. In conclusion, while planting an apple tree in the front yard is a plausible answer due to the prominence and ornamental value of the tree, other options like Wisconsin, countryside, fields, and backyard can also be accurate, as they all provide suitable environments for growing apple trees. The final choice depends on the preferences, circumstances, and location of the tree owner."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Doesn't connect\\" Answer:","output":"★"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He arrived in the United States two years later. His father, a cabinet maker, had moved to New York City shortly before Bobby's birth and sent for his family in 1925. Thomson grew up on Staten Island in New York City and signed with the New York Giants for a 100 bonus right out of Curtis High School in 1942. Thomson became a celebrity for his walk-off home run off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca to win the 1951 National League pennant. The home run, nicknamed the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\", was dramatic as, until 1969, league pennants were only decided by playoff when the teams involved finished the regular season in a tie. Prior to 1951 playoffs had only been necessary in 1946 (NL) and 1948 (AL).  Although in mid-August the Giants were 13 1/2  games behind the league-leading Dodgers, they won 37 of their final 44 games to tie Brooklyn on the final day of the regular season, forcing a three-game playoff. The Giants won the first game 3-1 as a result of a two-run home run by Thomson (off Branca). Brooklyn's Clem Labine shut out the Giants in the second game, 10-0. The decisive contest, played on October 3 at the Polo Grounds, was the first major sporting event televised coast-to-coast in the United States. The Dodgers took a 4-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning; but Giants shortstop Alvin Dark singled, advanced to third on a single by Don Mueller, and scored on a double by Whitey Lockman. With Lockman on second and pinch-runner Clint Hartung at third, Thomson's walk-off home run turned looming defeat into a 5-4 victory. The moment was immortalized by Giants play-by-play announcer Russ Hodges's excited multiple repetitions: \\"The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!\\"  Waiting in the on-deck circle to hit behind Thomson was rookie Willie Mays. The Giants' season ended, however, at the 1951 World Series; the Yankees swept the last three games to win the best-of-seven series, 4 games to 2. Thomson batted .238 in the Series with no home runs.  The bat from the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" is in the collection of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. The uniform worn by Thomson on that day is apparently a part of a large private collection owned by Dan Scheinman, a member of the San Francisco Giants ownership group. What was Bobby Thomson's role in this?","output":"Bobby Thomson was a baseball player who played an important part in helping the New York Giants win a big game. He hit a famous home run, called the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World,\\" which made his team win the 1951 National League pennant. This means they got to play in an important tournament called the World Series, but they didn't end up winning the whole thing.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The creative projects of World Food Program (WFP) focused on preventing hunger from taking hold in the future and breaking the cycle of hunger. Here are some of the ways in which we work to prevent hunger in the future: School Meals As well as directly addressing hunger, School Meals projects encourage families to keep their children in school and help them build better futures. If children aren't hungry they will concentrate on their lessons. With a solid education growing children have a better chance of finding their own way out of hunger. These projects benefit girls especially. For more information: www.wfp.org/schools meals. Food for Assets  WFP's Food for Assets projects provide the hungry with food to lay the foundation for a better tomorrow. When poor farmers no longer have to worry about the next meal, they have the time and energy to build irrigation  systems that can increase production. Similarly, Food for Training projects allow the poor to devote time to learning skills that will sustain  them economically in the future. For more information: www.wfp.org/food-assets. HIV/AIDS WFP uses its food rations  to reduce the blow of HIV and AIDS. The agency distributes its rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, so they can keep providing for their families for longer and have time to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children--the next generation of food providers in developing countries. For more information: www.wfp.org/hiv-aids. Purchase for Progress WFP buys large amounts of food in developing countries. It has this purchasing power and uses it to help poor farmers contact reliable markets where they can get competitive prices for their produce. With secure markets, farmers will be encouraged to produce more and innovate .The knock-on effect is producing more food for everyone. For more information: www.wfp.ofp/purchase-progress. Question: AIDS children can benefit from food rations in that  _  . Answer: A:","output":"AIDS children can benefit from food rations in several ways. Firstly, when the World Food Program (WFP) provides food rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, it enables them to maintain their health and strength, allowing them to continue providing for their families. This support can prolong the time these individuals have to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children, who represent the next generation of food providers in developing countries. Secondly, food rations can help mitigate the impact of HIV and AIDS on affected families, who may struggle to meet their daily nutritional needs due to illness or the loss of income-earning members. By supporting these families with food rations, the WFP helps ensure that AIDS children have access to adequate nutrition, which is critical for their growth, development, and overall well-being. Additionally, access to food rations can encourage families to keep their AIDS-affected children in school, as they won't have to worry about the next meal. Proper education is essential for breaking the cycle of poverty and hunger, and ensuring that these children have the tools they need to build a better future for themselves and their communities. By addressing the root causes and consequences of hunger through food rations, the WFP can greatly improve the quality of life and long-term prospects of AIDS children and their families in developing countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of treating foot blisters, following these steps makes more sense: 1. Clean the area: Wash your hands to avoid introducing any bacteria, and then gently clean the affected area with soap and water or an antiseptic wipe. This is essential to prevent infection. 2. Disinfect a needle: To safely drain a blister, you will need a sterilized needle. You can sterilize a needle at home by using rubbing alcohol or by holding it in an open flame (such as from a lighter or match) for a few seconds, and then letting it cool. 3. Drain the blister: Gently puncture the blister with the sterilized needle near its edge. Apply light pressure to the blister, allowing the fluid to drain out. This will relieve the pressure and help the healing process. Avoid tearing or removing the skin covering the blister, as it serves as a natural barrier against infection. 4. Apply antibiotic ointment: After draining the blister, apply a small amount of antibiotic ointment (such as Neosporin) to prevent infection. This step further ensures the healing process goes smoothly. 5. Cover the blister: Use a sterile, non-stick bandage or gauze pad to cover the blister. This helps protect it from further irritation and potential infection. Make sure to change the bandage daily or if it gets wet or dirty. 6. Avoid further irritation: If possible, wear open-toed shoes or footwear that doesn't cause friction on the affected area. You can also use padding or cushioning (such as moleskin or blister pads) around the blister to protect it from further irritation. 7. Monitor the healing process: Keep an eye on the blister as it heals. If you notice any signs of infection, such as increased redness, pus, or worsening pain and swelling, seek medical attention promptly.

Process:  - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less water is absorbed by the plant happens, how will it affect LESS sugar and oxygen being produced.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of less water being absorbed by the plant can have a direct effect on the process of photosynthesis, which will consequently result in less sugar and oxygen being produced. When a plant absorbs less water, it can directly impact the process of photosynthesis in the following ways: 1. Water is an essential component in the photosynthesis process as it provides the hydrogen atoms needed for the formation of glucose (sugar). With less water absorbed, the plant will have limited hydrogen atoms for glucose formation, thus reducing the production of sugar. 2. In order to conserve water, plants may close their stomata in response to reduced water absorption. This will also limit the intake of carbon dioxide from the air, which is a primary reactant in photosynthesis. As a result, less carbon dioxide will be available for the production of sugars and oxygen, leading to a decrease in their overall production. 3. Less water in the plant can also result in reduced turgor pressure within the plant cells, affecting the overall structural integrity of the leaves and their ability to efficiently capture sunlight for photosynthesis. In turn, this will affect the production of sugars and oxygen. In conclusion, the perturbation of less water being absorbed by the plant will have a direct effect on the photosynthesis process. This will lead to less sugar and oxygen being produced due to the limited availability of essential resources, closed stomata, and potentially compromised leaf structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Alice in Wonderland Movie plot: On a riverbank, Alice's sister is teaching her a history lesson, but Alice is playing with her cat, Dinah, instead of listening, and begins to daydream about living in a nonsensical world. She then spots a White Rabbit in a waistcoat passing by, exclaiming that he is \\"late for a very important date\\". Alice gives chase, following him into a large, furnished rabbit hole. She falls down into a vertical passage, and sees the Rabbit disappear into a room and leave through a tiny door. She tries to follow him but is too big to fit through the door, whose talking knob advises her to alter her size by drinking from a bottle marked âDrink Meâ, which appears on a table. The contents cause her to shrink rapidly. Unfortunately, the door is locked and the key is on the table, out of reach. A box of cookies appears before Alice, and she tries one marked âEat Meâ, and grows so large that her head hits the ceiling. Upset, she weeps large tears which flood the room. She drinks the last of the contents in the bottle and shrinks again, easily floating through the door's keyhole and into Wonderland inside the bottle. She meets numerous strange characters, including the Dodo, who invites her to take part in a caucus race to get dry, and Tweedledum and Tweedledee, who recount the tale of \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\". Alice tracks the White Rabbit to his house; he sends her to retrieve his gloves after mistaking her for his housemaid. While searching for them, she eats another cookie marked âEat Meâ from the Rabbit's cookie canister and grows large again, getting stuck in the house. The Rabbit, thinking Alice is a monster, brings the Dodo to his house to help him get rid of her. After chimney sweep Bill the Lizard fails to remove her from the house after she sneezes him out, they plot to burn the house down, but Alice escapes by eating a carrot from the Rabbit's garden and shrinking to the size of an insect.

The two plot lines are told in parallel through flashbacks. In 2002, software engineer Alan Russell moves into a new house with his wife Marie, 10-year-old son Tim, and 12-year-old daughter Kaylie. Alan purchases an antique mirror to decorate his office. Unbeknownst to them, the mirror supernaturally induces hallucinations. Marie is haunted by visions of her own body decaying, while Alan is seduced by a ghostly woman named Marisol, who has mirrors in place of eyes. Over time, the parents become psychotic; Alan isolates himself in his office, and Marie becomes withdrawn and paranoid. All of the plants in the house die, and the family dog disappears after being shut in the office with the mirror. After Kaylie sees Alan with Marisol, she tells her mother, and the parents fight. One night, Marie goes insane and attempts to kill her children, but Alan locks her away. When the family runs out of food, the children realize that their father is under the influence of the mirror, so Kaylie goes to seek help from their mother, and finds her chained to the wall, acting like an animal.

Arrogant Matthew Duggan tells police he deserves better cell because he is 'better than anyone else here' By. David Baker. PUBLISHED:. 13:14 EST, 9 March 2012. |. UPDATED:. 13:18 EST, 9 March 2012. Appalling: Wealthy estate agent Matthew Duggan has been jailed for six years after a court heard the brutal rape was broadcast on the victim's mobile phone which accidentally dialled 999 during the attack. An estate agent who boasted that he was better than anyone else raped a young woman unaware that his brutal attack was heard by emergency services via the screaming victim’s mobile phone. Matthew Duggan from Sunbury-Upon-Thames, Middlesex, beat the 19-year-old girl black and blue before forcing her to perform oral sex on him and trying to have sex with her. But what neither he nor his bruised and bloodied victim realised was. that her mobile had somehow dialled 999 - meaning her cries for. help and his angry threats were heard by control operators manning an. emergency switchboard. The 20-year-old Duggan was jailed for six years after being. found guilty of rape and attempted rape by a jury, following an eight day. trial at Guildford Crown Court. He was also ordered to be put on the sex offenders register indefinitely. The court even heard how the arrogant defendant told police when he was arrested: 'I should be put in a more luxurious cell because I’m better than anyone else here'. The chillling remark was kept from the jury at Duggan’s trial but was read out by the Judge, Recorder Jeremy Carter-Manning, at today’s sentencing hearing. Jailing the defendant the Judge told him: 'You have an inappropriate opinion of your status and an inappropriate attitude towards women'. The Judge added: 'Your behaviour that evening was absolutely appalling and very serious indeed'. He also said there were unusual features to the case which made it of particular concern but that it was only Duggan’s comparative youth that had saved him from a much longer sentence. The Judge added: 'Bizarrely, and for some. reason that we don’t know, a mobile phone at the scene recorded and. transmitted to the emergency services details of what was a very. harrowing incident'. Jailed: Duggan was sentenced to six years in jail at Guildford Crown Court today for rape. The brutal attack was inadvertently heard by police operators after the victim's phone accidentally called 999. A recording of the incident was played to the jury, in which the terrified girl was heard begging for mercy as the defendant yelled: 'Open your legs. You’re getting raped.' Today’s hearing was told by defence counsel, Mr. Jon Swain, that his client came from a respectable supportive family and was highly thought of at work. But the events outlined in court showed a different and darker side to the defendant’s character. During the horrific ordeal the victim was stripped of her clothes and Duggan himself fled the scene naked after a local dog walker and friends arrived on the scene in a meadow at Chertsey, Surrey. The girl was rushed battered and bleeding to St. Peter’s Hospital, Chertsey, by ambulance. In her evidence, the girl told police: 'He was trying it on. I said no and that’s what made him really angry. 'I was telling him no. He punched me and blood was coming down my face. I had no clothes on. 'All I can remember was him forcing me to perform oral sex. 'The shock made it a blur. I couldn’t believe it.' Ruby Selva, prosecuting told the. court: 'The victim had 33 separate injuries on her body and dried blood. on her face. She also had a chipped tooth.' But. despite the damning weight of evidence against him, the defendant. denied the charges, saying: 'Any sexual contact between us was. consensual.' Arrogant: Estate agent Duggan told police when he was arrested that he 'should be put in a more luxurious cell because I'm better than anyone else here' Duggan admitted beating the girl up and even offered to plead guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm in an unsuccessful plea bargain. In his defence he claimed he had lost his temper and become consumed with 'hatred' after the victim had performed a 'vile' and painful sex act upon him while they were kissing and cuddling in some grass near the Meads, Chertsey, after meeting up following a night on the town. 'I felt violated. I wanted to cause her maximum pain.' he said. But the prosecution rejected Duggan’s version of events and insisted that the real reason for the defendant’s dramatic loss of control was because the girl had rejected his advances. He was arrested the in the early morning, the day after the attack, on July 24 last year after he had helped himself to some clothes from a boat on the River Thames. He answered 'no comment' to police questions and a GP called to examine him in the police cells, Dr Paul Brigg, said he was astonished at how relaxed and care-free the defendant seemed even after having been accused of such serious offences. 'He was flippant and jokey and didn’t seem to be taking the proceedings very seriously. I found it quite extraordinary,' said Dr. Brigg. The court heard that the girl, from Surrey, had met Duggan when she had gone out drinking with her mates. Ms Selva said that several members of the group had gone to the Meads but the defendant and the girl became separated from the others. She said Duggan suddenly turned violent when the she rejected his advances. 'During the ensuing attack, he repeatedly hit her and threatened her,' said Ms Selva. But unknown to the defendant or the victim, the girl’s mobile had somehow called 999 and was on during the incident. 'It recorded some of the attack. The call was harrowing and horrific in its content. 'Throughout the incident, the complainant was fighting, crying and begging the defendant to leave her alone,' she said. Ms Selva said the phone recording was a key piece of evidence. She added: 'It captures his brutality and his crimes. 'The injuries which the victim was found to have sustained were wholly consistent with force being used.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A man named Matthew Duggan did something very bad to a young woman. He hurt her and forced her to do things she didn't want to do. This is called rape and it's a terrible crime. During this scary time, the woman's phone accidentally called 999, which is the number people dial when they need help from the police. The people who answer the emergency calls heard the woman's cries for help and the bad things the man was saying. Later, Matthew Duggan went to court because of his bad actions, and the judge said he must go to prison for six years. They also decided Matthew's name should be on a special list of people who have done very wrong things. The woman got hurt a lot during the attack, but the man didn't say sorry and still said it was okay for them to do those things together. The police and the court didn't believe him, and they had the recording from the phone call as proof."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano  became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink.  Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\".

This Act may be cited as the \`\`Financial Accounting Standards Board  Act''. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.     As used in this Act--             (1) FASB.--The term \`\`FASB'' means the Financial Accounting          Standards Board.             (2) Federal regulatory program.--The term \`\`Federal          regulatory program'' means a program enacted under the          authority of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution and          providing for the regulation of the interstate or foreign          commerce of the United States, or the use of the means or          instrumentalities of such commerce.

SEC. 3. STANDARDS AUTHORITATIVE.

SEC. 4. DUTY OF FASB.     The duty of the FASB shall be to establish and improve, after  independent and impartial deliberation, standards of financial  accounting and reporting for any person. To accomplish its duty, the  FASB shall act to--             (1) improve the usefulness to present and potential          investors, creditors, and other users, of financial reporting          made by firms in interstate commerce focusing on the primary          characteristics of relevance and reliability;             (2) keep standards current to reflect changes in methods of          doing business and changes in the economic environment;             (3) consider promptly any significant areas of deficiency          in financial reporting that might be improved through the          standard-setting process;             (4) promote the international convergence of accounting          standards concurrent with improving the quality of financial          reporting; and             (5) improve the common understanding of the nature and          purposes of information contained in financial reports. SEC. 5. REQUIREMENTS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.     (a) General Principles.--In promulgating and revising standards of  financial accounting and reporting, the FASB shall follow the following  principles:             (1) Financial reporting should provide information that is          useful to present and potential investors and creditors and          other users in making rational investment, credit, and similar          decisions. The information should be comprehensible to those          who have a reasonable understanding of business and economic          activities and are willing to study the information with          reasonable diligence.             (2) Financial reporting should provide information to help          present and potential investors and creditors and other users          in assessing the amounts, timing, and uncertainty of          prospective cash receipts from dividends or interest and the          proceeds from the sale, redemption, or maturity of the          securities or loans.             (3) Financial reporting should provide information about          the economic resources of an enterprise, the claims to those          resources (obligations of the enterprise to transfer resources          to other entities and owners' equity), and the effects of          transactions, events, and circumstances that change resources          and claims to those resources.     (b) Operating Objectives.--The FASB shall promote the following  objectives in the conduct of its activities:             (1) To be objective in its decision making and to ensure,          insofar as possible, the neutrality of information resulting          from its standards. To be neutral, information must report          economic activity as faithfully as possible without coloring          the image it communicates for the purpose of influencing          behavior in any particular direction.             (2) To weigh carefully the views of its constituents in          developing concepts and standards. However, the ultimate          determinant of concepts and standards must be the FASB's          judgment, based on research, public input, and careful          deliberation about the usefulness of the resulting information.             (3) To bring about needed changes in ways that minimize          disruption to the continuity of reporting practice, including          establishment of reasonable effective dates and transition          provisions when new standards are introduced. Change should be          evolutionary to the extent that it can be accommodated by the          need for relevance, reliability, comparability, and          consistency.             (4) To review the effects of past decisions and interpret,          amend, or replace standards in a timely fashion when such          action is indicated.     (c) Primary Standard Requiring Adherence to Principles.--             (1) Promulgation required.--The FASB shall promulgate a          primary standard requiring the application of the principles          articulated in subsection (a) of this section to financial          accounting and reporting. Except as provided in paragraph (2),          such primary standard shall prohibit the application of any          other standard of financial accounting and reporting          promulgated by the FASB in a manner, or with a result, that          fails to comply with such principles.             (2) Deviations explained and justified.--The primary          standard promulgated pursuant to this subsection may allow for          deviation from the application of such principles only if an          explanation and justification for the basis of the deviation is          specifically articulated and made public.     (d) Establishment of Additional Standards.--The FASB shall develop  additional standards of financial accounting and reporting to address  issues relating to--             (1) off-balance-sheet accounting practices and standards,          and accounting requirements for special-purpose entities, in a          manner that is based on principles for determining bona fide          economic control; and             (2) requirements for marked-to-market accounting, including          consideration of the application of fair value to agreements          involving commitments on the part of an issuer.     (e) Additional Projects.--             (1) Fair value project.--Within one year after the date of          enactment of this Act, FASB shall complete work on the project          entitled \`\`Measuring All Financial Assets and Liabilities at          Fair Value''.             (2) Revenue and liability recognition proposal.--Within 18          months after the date of enactment of this Act, FASB shall          complete work on the proposal entitled \`\`Proposal for new          agenda project: Issues relating to the recognition of revenues          and liabilities''. SEC. 6. PRESERVATION OF AUTHORITY.     Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit--             (1) the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission          under the securities laws (as such term is defined in section          3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.          78c(a)(47)); or             (2) the authority of any other Federal agency under the          laws applicable to a Federal regulatory program administered by          such agency.

The Act aims to establish and improve standards of financial accounting and reporting by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for any person under any Federal regulatory program. The FASB's duties include improving the usefulness of financial reporting, keeping standards current, considering areas of deficiency, promoting the international convergence of accounting standards, and improving the understanding of financial reports. The FASB is required to follow general principles, such as providing useful information to investors and creditors and providing information about economic resources and claims. The FASB must also adhere to operating objectives, such as being objective in decision-making, weighing the views of constituents, minimizing disruption to reporting practices when introducing changes, and reviewing the effects of past decisions. Furthermore, the FASB must develop additional standards to address off-balance-sheet accounting practices and marked-to-market accounting requirements. The FASB must also complete projects related to fair value measurements and recognizing revenues and liabilities. The Act also preserves the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other Federal agencies and requires the FASB to transmit annual reports assessing resources, evaluating compliance, and detailing progress on unresolved issues and the treatment of intangible assets.

In which country is 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' set?","output":"'A Midsummer Night's Dream' is set in Athens, Greece, and its surrounding woods, which includes the enchanted forest where most of the play's action takes place. As one of William Shakespeare's most popular and widely performed comedies, the play is a complex and entertaining exploration of love, desire, and the wondrous whims of the natural world. Its setting in ancient Greece reflects the rich history and deeply rooted traditions of the classical world while allowing Shakespeare to create a magical, mythical atmosphere replete with fairies, gods, and fantastical creatures. The use of Athens and the nearby forest as the primary setting for 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' provides the ideal backdrop for the thematic interplay between reason and imagination, order and chaos. It allows for the juxtaposition between the world of Athenian nobility and the inhabitants of the forest, particularly the fairies under the rule of Oberon and Titania. Athens, the capital city of ancient Greece, has always been associated with knowledge, wisdom, and civilization, serving as the center of Greek culture, philosophy, and the arts. In the play, the Duke of Athens, Theseus, and his fiancée, the Amazon Queen Hippolyta, are preparing for their upcoming nuptials, while the young lovers Hermia, Lysander, Demetrius, and Helena navigate their complex romantic entanglements. The rigid social hierarchy and strict rules governing courtship and marriage in Athens provide the impetus for a series of comic misunderstandings and plot twists that drive the action in the enchanted forest. Within the sheltering forest, the supernatural aspects of the play come to the fore. The forest is depicted as a mysterious, magical space, separate from the ordered, regulated world of Athens. Governed by the unpredictable whims of Oberon, king of the fairies, and his queen, Titania, it serves as the site of their quarrels and their meddling in the love lives of the mortals who have ventured into their domain. This enchanted landscape is home to the mischievous Puck, the fairy character responsible for many of the play's confusions and comic developments, as well as various other fairy creatures who populate the forest.  In 'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' Shakespeare effectively uses the contrasting settings of Athens and the enchanted forest to explore themes such as love, illusion, the supernatural, and the transformative power of nature. The choice of ancient Greece, with its rich cultural and mythological heritage, serves as the perfect backdrop for this captivating, humorous, and thought-provoking play."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Shame really - very rarely do I watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end. I've seen quite a few of Ira Levin's adaptations - 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives' - and liked both them, but this just didn't appeal to me. When I read the plot outline - an award winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to murder one of his former pupils (Christopher Reeve) and steel his script for his own success - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine's a good actor, Sidney Lumet's a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but all I'd say is there are LOADS of twists and turns. So many its kind of hard to explain the film's plot line in detail, without giving it away. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes, before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out. Though I have to give Lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loud. The main cast - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles. Though Worth's obvious fake Russian accent got on my nerves slightly (nothing personal Irene, I think any actor's fake accent would irritate me). Not sure if Cannon's character was meant to be annoyingly funny but Dyan managed to annoy and amuse - at the same time. Anyone reading this - I don't want you to be put-off watching this because of my views - give it a chance, you may like it, you may not. It's all about opinion.

Answer:","output":"Ridley was a skilled English cricketer who was born around 1780 in England. Arthur Haygarth, a prominent cricket historian, chronicled his career and background, giving us a glimpse of his life and achievements on the field. Ridley's full name remains unknown, but his surname and his connection to cricket have been well-documented. As a batsman, Ridley played for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), a prestigious and well-respected institution known for producing some of the best talents in English cricket. The details of his batting hand remain unclear, but his skill in that role is not in doubt. He also contributed as a bowler, delivering underarm balls, a style that was prevalent during his time. Again, the particulars concerning the hand he used and the type of deliveries he specialized in are not well documented, but it is clear that he was considered a proficient player in both roles. Throughout Ridley's career, he donned the England jersey and represented the country in various important matches between 1801 and 2013. It is worth noting that the information available points towards a sense of mystery surrounding Ridley's life and career, with facts such as his full name and specific cricketing skills remaining unknown. In summary, Ridley was an English cricketer who made a significant impact on the sport during his time. Born around 1780, he played as a batsman and bowler, representing the prestigious Marylebone Cricket Club. His contributions to English cricket were noteworthy, and despite the lack of complete information about his life, his legacy in the world of cricket endures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Wallflowers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1989 by singer-songwriter Jakob Dylan and guitarist Tobi Miller. The band has gone through a number of personnel changes but has remained centered on Dylan. After releasing their eponymous debut album in 1992, the Wallflowers released what would become their best-known and highest-selling album, Bringing Down the Horse in 1996, which featured songs such as \\"One Headlight\\" and \\"6th Avenue Heartache\\". They went on to release an additional three albums before going on a seven-year hiatus, beginning in 2006. In July 2004, the Wallflowers returned to the studio to record their fifth album, Rebel, Sweetheart. This time the band decided to record in Atlanta, Georgia, which is where their producer for this album, Brendan O'Brien, is based. O'Brien also contributed on guitar. Fred Eltringham joined the Wallflowers as their new drummer. Jakob Dylan wrote the songs, of which keyboardist Rami Jaffee has said: \\"What I did notice is that kind of upbeat song with some pretty scary lyrics.\\" Dylan painted the album's cover art himself.  On October 14, 2004, the Warren Zevon tribute album Enjoy Every Sandwich: The Songs of Warren Zevon was released, on which the Wallflowers covered Zevon's 1978 song \\"Lawyers, Guns and Money.\\" In promotion of the album, the Wallflowers performed \\"Lawyers, Guns and Money\\" on the Late Show with David Letterman with Zevon's son, Jordan, on October 12, 2004.  On October 31, 2004, the Wallflowers were flown via military transport plane to the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to perform for the returning troops.  Rebel, Sweetheart was released on May 24, 2005, and was met with positive reviews. Despite widespread critical acclaim, Rebel, Sweetheart performed relatively poorly commercially, peaking at No. 40 on the Billboard 200. However, the first single from the album, \\"The Beautiful Side of Somewhere\\", hit No. 5 on AAA radio. The second single was \\"God Says Nothing Back\\". This was the first Wallflowers album to be released on DualDisc. On one side was the album, and on the other was a DVD that included exclusive performances and arrangements of some of the band's songs, as well as an interview with comedian Jon Lovitz. In promotion of the album, the Wallflowers did concerts for the Oxygen Custom Concert Series and PBS Soundstage. Around the time of the album's release, the band set out on what would be their last tour for two years. They were joined by Stuart Mathis on lead guitar. After 2005, the Wallflowers ended their relationship with Interscope Records. What did they try next","output":"After ending their relationship with Interscope Records in 2005, the Wallflowers went on a seven-year hiatus starting from 2006."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the story that is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata?, using the article: Rinaldo (HWV 7) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, composed in 1711, and was the first Italian language opera written specifically for the London stage. The libretto was prepared by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill, and the work was first performed at the Queen's Theatre in London's Haymarket on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the First Crusade, is loosely based on Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme liberata (\\"Jerusalem Delivered\\"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres. Handel composed Rinaldo quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. Rinaldo is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece. Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. Rinaldo was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, Rinaldo was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in baroque opera during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, Halle, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's Metropolitan Opera in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. Rinaldo was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's tercentenary in 2011 brought a modernized..., what would be the answer ?

Do you want to be able to communicate with deaf people in general? Would you like to advance in your career by being able to communicate in ASL? Do you want to be a Sign Language interpreter? Sign language is not just a random   collection of gestures but a full-blown   language in its own right, complete with its own grammatical rules. Each country or region has its own sign language, as different from each other as English is from Spanish. Each version of sign language is somewhat linked to the spoken language in its region. For example, American sign language does share similarities with English, even though it is its own language. The advantages of knowing sign language in addition to a spoken language are many. Communication becomes possible on many levels with the deaf community, with other people either hearing or not in any of the above situations, as well as many more. While other languages take years to learn, American Sign Language can be taught in a much shorter time period. It is one of the easiest languages to learn because most of the signs were developed to mimic the actual word or phrase it is representing. Even the alphabet signs look like the letters of the English alphabet. American Sign Language, or ASL, is the third most used language in the United States. Used by the deaf community, interpreters, and friends and family of the deaf. There are a lot of sites on the internet that not only shows you the sign with video, but will help you practice reading signs as well. Teaching even hearing babies sign language seems to be the fashion in recent years and for good reason. Communicating in sign language is fun and natural as babies naturally use body gestures in early communication. Teaching baby sign language actually appears to enhance the learning of verbal skills and brain development of the children involved.

Please answer the following question: Once, while grating potatoes to make potato pancakes, I had a Proustian moment. I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal.

Despite this difficulty, the reviewer highly recommends the game to others, suggesting that they still find it enjoyable and worth trying. 4. The reviewer addresses a specific issue they have encountered with the game (the Ahnk), which indicates some dissatisfaction.

Answer:","output":"Carson, having been caught in a lie by Lee, would likely want to take a few steps to address the situation and repair any damage done to their relationship or reputation. While it is not possible to predict an individual's actions with certainty, some common next steps might include: 1. Apologizing: Carson will want to start with a sincere apology, demonstrating remorse for lying and acknowledging the negative impact it has had on Lee and their relationship. 2. Explaining: Carson has already tried providing Lee with an explanation, but it's essential to ensure that the explanation is honest, clear, and addresses the reasons for the lie. This might involve admitting any fears or insecurities that led to the deception and discussing alternatives to lying that could be used in the future. 3. Taking responsibility: Carson should take full responsibility for the lie and avoid deflecting blame onto external circumstances or other individuals. This shows maturity and understanding of the gravity of the situation. 4. Making amends: If the lie has caused tangible harm to Lee or others, Carson should attempt to make amends in some way. This could involve correcting any misinformation spread by the lie or offering support to those affected. 5. Rebuilding trust: Trust is often damaged when lies are uncovered, so Carson will need to work on rebuilding trust with Lee. This involves being consistently honest and transparent in their interactions moving forward. 6. Reflecting on the situation: Carson should take some time to reflect on the reasons behind the lie and learn from this experience. This might involve seeking personal growth through self-improvement techniques, therapy, or focusing on better communication skills. 7. Giving space: Finally, depending on the severity of the lie and Lee's reaction, Carson might need to give Lee some space and time to process the situation before attempting to repair the relationship fully. Carson's strategy will likely involve some combination of these steps, with their specific actions adapted based on the details of the situation, their personal values, and the preferences of the individuals involved."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer is:","output":"The formation of ice crystals within the cloud. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The formation of ice crystals within the cloud: This is the missing first step. When the temperature inside a cloud decreases and reaches the freezing point, it leads to the formation of ice crystals. This is important for the next steps in the process. 2. Ice inside the cloud bumping around and causing electrostatic charges: As the ice particles within the cloud collide with one another, they generate electrostatic charges. This sets the stage for the later steps involving the build-up of positive and negative charges. 3. The cloud becomes a thundercloud: The presence of these electrostatic charges within the cloud transforms it into a thundercloud. This is important because it signifies that the buildup of charges has reached a point where lightning may occur. 4. Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge: The continued collisions of ice particles and the separation of charges within the cloud create a strong negative charge at the base of the thundercloud. 5. Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud: As the negative charge at the base of the cloud increases, it attracts and pulls positive charges, typically found on the ground below the cloud. This sets up the conditions for a lightning strike. 6. The positive energy gathers on the ground: The positive charges accumulate on the ground or other objects below the cloud in response to the negative charge in the cloud. 7.

The company has already found \\"a close connection between color and satisfaction with a person's work area\\". That's according to its spokeswoman named Meghan Casserly. \\"Color is a silent salesperson,\\" said Elyria Kemp. She is an assistant professor of marketing at the University of New Orleans. Kemp is following color trends in business. She is studying the connection between feelings and color. According to Kemp, when people make an evaluation of a product, usually they do this within 90 seconds or less. Besides, more than half of their first evaluation is based on (......) color alone. That's why so many companies are researching their color choices. They are spending thousands of dollars on the research, too. Just think of UPS's Pullman brown, Home Depot's orange and Tiffany & Co.'s blue. Joclyn Benedetto is a spokeswoman for Tiffany & Co. She said the success of the company's jewelry was connected to its blue color. It is used to wrap every product. She said the color was chosen by the founder Charles Lewis Tiffany for the cover of Blue Book, Tiffany's annual collection of beautifully hand-made jewels, which first came out in 1845. Coca-Cola's red color also dates back more than 100 years. The soft drink was shipped in barrels painted red. A spokesperson for Home Depot said research showed that the first thing people thought of was orange when they heard the name of the company. Smaller companies are also realizing the importance of color.

The number of US call centers is expected to decline through 2008, with Canada getting many of the jobs the US will lose, a research firm said Friday.","output":"This statement is about the decline of the number of U.S. call centers through 2008, and Canada receiving many of the jobs that the U.S. will lose during that period. In order to discuss this statement, let's break it down into steps: 1. Identify the main subject: The main subject of the statement is the U.S. call centers and the expected changes in their numbers. Additionally, Canada's role in receiving the lost jobs is a secondary subject of focus. 2. Analyze the information provided: The statement tells us that the number of U.S. call centers is expected to decline through 2008. This implies that there is a trend of call centers either closing down or relocating to other countries. 3. Consider the implications: With the decline in the number of U.S. call centers, job losses are a potential consequence. This could have an impact on U.S. employment rates, as well as on the overall operation and growth of the call center industry. 4. Examine the role of Canada: The statement also mentions that Canada is expected to receive many of the jobs the U.S. will lose. This implies that call center jobs are being relocated to Canada, where companies may find more favorable conditions for their operations. Factors that could contribute to this trend include lower operating costs, skilled workforce availability, and cultural proximity to the U.S. market. 5. Discuss the source: The statement attributes this information to a research firm. Thus, this prediction is based on the analysis and research conducted by industry experts, making it a credible and important piece of information to consider. In conclusion, the statement is about the anticipated decline in the number of U.S. call centers through 2008 and the transfer of jobs to Canada. This implies that the call center industry in the U.S. could shrink, with Canada benefiting from the relocation of jobs.

Question: Haeundae-gu is in North Korea? Movie title: Haeundae Movie plot: Located on the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula, Haeundae district of Busan, South Korea draws one million visitors to its beaches every year. Several years ago, Man-sik, a Haeundae local, lost Yeon-hee's father due to his mistake in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake while deep-sea fishing together at the Indian Ocean. Because of this, for years, Man-sik wasn't able to become involved with Yeon-hee, who runs an unlicensed seafood restaurant, despite her attempts to start a relationship (Yeon-hee doesn't know that her father was killed due to Man-sik's mistake.). Dong-choon &amp; Seung-hyun's Grandma team up with Seung-hyun and gets involved with some 'illegal' activity to earn money, but the two end up getting caught by the police. Afterwards, Dong-choon's mother finds when Man-sik's uncle (Eok-jo) was with her when the tsunami hit, she was worried about Dong-choon &amp; Eok-jo was worried about Man-sik! Then, Seung-hyun meets Ji-min &amp; decides to prepare him for a job interview, but Dong-choon refuses. As time passes, Man-sik finally plans to propose to Yeon-hee on a night with fireworks. Geologist Kim Hwi somehow runs into his divorced wife, Yoo-jin, who is preparing for an expo in Busan. Although Yoo-jin has a daughter named Ji-min (and also a new boyfriend named Hae-chan), they decide not to tell their daughter that he (Hwi) is her real father, afraid that the child (Ji-min) would be greatly surprised and shocked!

But as time passes on, love starts to grow between...","output":"Firstly, to answer your question: Haeundae-gu is not in North Korea; it is a district in Busan, South Korea. Regarding whether it's worth investing in the \\"Haeundae\\" movie proposal, there are several factors to consider: 1. Genre and target audience: The movie combines elements of drama, romance, and disaster genres. It seems to target a wide range of audience, including fans of the involved actors, people interested in the South Korean culture, and those who enjoy disaster movies. You should consider whether this mix of genres and target audience aligns with your investment interests. 2. Production team: It is important to research the film's director, producers, and the production company behind it, as their previous work and box-office success can give you an idea of what to expect in terms of quality and financial return. Look for a team with a strong record in related genres to increase the likelihood of a successful project. 3. Cast: The talent attached to the project can play a significant role in the movie's success, especially in pulling in audiences. Research the actors involved and their past performances, both in terms of acting ability and box-office draws. 4. Distribution and marketing plans: The way a movie is distributed and marketed can make a huge difference in its financial success. Ensure that there are comprehensive plans for advertising, theatrical release, and international distribution in place, as these factors can greatly impact the film's financial return. 5. Budget: Get a clear understanding of the movie's budget, including any overflow expectations. Make sure that the expected return on investment (ROI) is consistent with your own financial goals. 6. Cultural and political relevance: Since the movie is set in South Korea and revolves around a natural disaster (tsunami), it may generate interest in the local audience and those affected by or interested in the issue. The connection to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake might also attract international attention,, as it was a significant global event. The political situation between North and South Korea could both positively or negatively affect the film's reception worldwide, thus adding a level of uncertainty to the investment. 7. Script and storyline: Analyze the provided plot to determine if it is engaging, unique, and well-structured. A strong story foundation can contribute to a film's overall success. In conclusion, investing in the \\"Haeundae\\" movie proposal requires careful evaluation of various aspects such as genre, target audience, production team, cast, marketing plans, budget, and cultural relevance. Assess the overall potential of the film and whether it aligns with your financial and investment goals before making a decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What caused the defeat that occurred in Kunowice, Poland? Context: The year 1759 saw several Prussian defeats. At the Battle of Kay, or Paltzig, the Russian Count Saltykov with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel. Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at Minden, Austrian general Daun forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 in the Battle of Maxen. Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf (now Kunowice Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at Gross-Jägersdorf (now Motornoye, Russia), and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.

Review: Enterprise, the latest high budget spin-off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90-minute episode called 'Broken Bow'. First we are swept into a massive action sequence with a Klingon being chased by some Suliban (who are the main enemy in the first season of the show). From there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is, with some of the best character development, story and action/visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time. The opening-credits is a debatable subject among the minority of Enterprise fans, whom some believe that the song is out of place. What they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves. If one listens to the actual song, instead of the theme, then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together. And eventually as the series progresses further and further, and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew, will the song actually become meaningful. Overall Diane Warren's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer Russell Watson. What makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered. Enterprise is (in my opinion) one of the most well cast shows since The Next Generation. Choosing Scott Bakula, as Captain Jonathan Archer was the best decision since Gene himself cast Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard. As the captain always leads the show, Bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins. He simply is (both actor wise and character wise) a superb human being and his charm, wit, and compassion are overwhelming to watch. As for the other cast members, a favourite of mine is John Billingsley who plays Dr. Phlox. It's also nice to see a non-human playing a role, and the decision to give the captain a dog, named 'Porthos' was a well-received idea. Throughout the show character development was brilliant, it was fast, well timed and almost perfect. I say almost because sadly Travis Mayweather's character played by the Briton Anthony Montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season. He does have some things to say here and there, but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important. Jolene Blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable Subcommander T'Pol. Dominic Keating as Lieutenant Malcolm Reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer. Connor Trinneer plays Commander Charles \\"Trip\\" Tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally Linda Park as Ensign Hoshi Sato, who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting. All of these characters make up Enterprise, and all bring a quality that Star Trek hasn't seen in a long time. Each person makes this show worth watching. Smiles and feel-good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship Enterprise NX-01. The ship itself, the NX-01 is somewhat questionable in design. The series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before Captain Kirk. So why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships, namely the Akira class starship? Continuity has been an issue in Enterprise, but thankfully Rick [Berman] and Brannon [Braga] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them. Continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details. If you see the show with and open mind, then you'll have no problems, but there is an urge to know 'why' all the time. So what did Berman and Braga offer to the Star Trek fan-base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself? According to them the NX-01 is how it is because of the incident in First Contact. When Zefram Cochrane saw the Enterprise-E through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by Commander Riker, it changed the ideas in his head. That's a good enough explanation for me.lets move on. Of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer, some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer. Come on guys grow up.When George Lucas destroyed the Star Wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy, fans couldn't do anything, only watch and sap it all up anyway. And then they learned that, well maybe its not that bad after all. If you can't accept a quality show for what it is, not what it should be in your mind, then go elsewhere. Or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do. The sets on Enterprise remind me very much of the Defiant from Deep Space Nine. They often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military. Perhaps that why the crew of the USS Enterprise (aka flagship of the American fleet) like it so much. They are striking sets, and represent the show perfectly. Rick Berman 'the overlord of the empire' as John Logan so accurately put it and his counterpart Brannon Braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have, and in all the right places. Whether that be technicalities, visuals, sound, editing or score. Enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be, when in the hands of geniuses.

I know that the answer to the question \\"In what region did the Austrian and French armies confront each other?\\" is in \\"In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The region where the Austrian and French armies confronted each other was primarily in Southern Germany and parts of Austria during the early stages of the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809. The conflict began when Austrian forces crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria on April 10. Napoleon's Grande Armée, which was initially caught off guard due to the surprise attack, had its two wings separated by 75 miles and only connected by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Austrian forces, led by Archduke Charles, targeted the left wing of the French army, specifically Marshal Davout's III Corps. In response to this threat, Napoleon, who had recently arrived at Donauwörth, devised the Landshut Maneuver, which aimed to cut off the Austrians and change the axis of his army. This strategic move led French forces to march towards the town of Eckmühl, where they scored a critical victory against the Austrian army in the Battle of Eckmühl. Following this defeat, Charles had to withdraw his forces across the Danube and into Bohemia. Eventually, on May 13, the French captured Vienna for the second time in four years. However, the war continued as a considerable portion of the Austrian army had survived the initial confrontations in Southern Germany. In summary, the region where the Austrian and French armies confronted each other during the War of the Fifth Coalition was primarily in Southern Germany and parts of Austria, specifically in the territories of Bavaria and along the Danube River."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC.

It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters.  - A lyricist or lyrist is a person who writes lyricswords for songsas opposed to a composer, who writes the song's melody.  - Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America.

Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records.

A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry.

A 13-year-old boy whose friend was accidentally shot dead as they played with a gun covered the body with a blanket and fled his family home, police said yesterday. The panic-stricken teen did not tell anyone what had happened and spent Wednesday night elsewhere, leaving his cousin to come home and find 14-year-old TyJuan Woodard lying dead on a futon.

It was not until a few hours later that the 13-year-old's relative took a closer look and realised he did not recognise the boy on the futon. He picked TyJuan up and noticed he was not breathing, having been shot in the chest. Someone called the emergency services and when officers arrived, they found the boy lying face-up on the floor, according to the police report. There was blood on his face and chest, and as medics lifted his shirt, they found what looked like a bullet wound. Police said everyone in the home said they didn't know the boy or what had happened. TyJuan lives elsewhere and had previously run away from home, according to police spokesman Lt Terry Hastings. Lt Hastings said officers talked to the other boy on Thursday morning. A woman who said she was the 13-year-old's grandmother said he stayed with his aunt on Wednesday night. 'He said he was scared, but I wish he had told me, just told me something,' she said. She had never seen TyJuan before he was found lying on the floor of her home. 'All I could see was blood on his nose,' she added. The woman is not being named so as not to identify her young grandson. Lt Hastings said he wasn't sure how the boys got a hold of the gun, which belongs to one of the 13-year-old's relatives.

The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

Joe's latest weaponâthe Broadcast Energy Transmitter (B.E.T.). Cobra assaults the Joes as they test the B.E.T. in the Himalayas. The Joes use the B.E.T. to activate their automated weapons systems. Serpentor is captured and Cobra Commander orders a retreat. Cobra Commander leads his troops into Cobra-La. As the Joes celebrate their victory, a new group of rookie Joes are brought onto the team, including the unlucky kunoichi Jinx, military police officer Law and his dog Order, former basketball player Big Lob, EOD specialist Tunnel Rat, covert operative Chuckles, and Duke's reckless half-brother, the green beret Lt. Falcon. In Cobra-La, the Joe forces are ambushed and detained within the Lovecraftian living environment. The Cobra soldiers are met by the civilization's ruler, Golobulus, who has Pythona and his other henchman, Nemesis Enforcer, arrest Cobra Commander. While there, Cobra learns about their history: 40,000 years ago, Cobra-La was an ancient civilization that ruled Earth. However, the Ice Age, the evolution of humans and their development of scientific technology resulted in Cobra-La's survivors being forced into caverns within the Himalayas. Cobra-La rebuilt their society in secret as centuries passed. Golobulus vowed to destroy humanity so that his people could re-claim the earth. He eventually discovered a nobleman who was working on biological weapons. The nobleman later became Cobra Commander, charged with conquering the world for Cobra-La. However, Cobra Commander's repeated failures caused Golobulus to use a Psychic Motivator on Mindbender to create Serpentor. Meanwhile, Falcon takes his...

Change up your routine.","output":"Imagine you are holding a bright, pretty ball. Every time we share good things, like kindness and love, the ball gets even brighter and happier. But, if we share mean things, like gossip, the ball loses its light and starts to get sadder and duller. So, in a big big world where everyone carries their own balls of light, wouldn't you want to keep your ball happy and bright? Now, when someone tries to share gossip with you, think about it like this. This person is passing you a dark, sad ball. Would you want to keep that? No, right? So, you can tell that person how you really feel. You might say something like, \\"I don't think it's nice to talk about someone like this.\\" Always remember, sharing bright, happy things makes the world a lovelier place. Sometimes, people will tell you things in secret. They might say things like, \\"I'm telling you this, but don't tell anyone else.\\" When they do that, they're giving you their light ball to keep safe. It's your job to make sure it stays happy and bright, and doesn't get turned into a dark, sad ball by becoming gossip. What if someone is mean to you, though? What if they try to turn your happy ball into a sad one? Well, then, you can think of yourself as a superhero with a shield. This shield keeps your ball safe from mean words or actions. It's important to stay calm and kind, even if other people are not being kind.  Sometimes, people might ask you questions that feel too personal, or that feel like they're not really their business. That's when you can say, \\"I don't think it's nice to ask that.\\" Remember, it's okay not to answer everything.  Learning to say no is part of being a good ball keeper. Lastly, changing up your routine can be fun. It's like switching paths on a walk or choosing a new game to play. This keeps life exciting and new, and might even lead to finding new bright, happy balls!

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\"? Answer:","output":"Question: Based on the passage, what factors contributed to the unique characteristics of the Cretaceous period, including the formation of chalk and the deposition of sedimentary layers? Provide specific examples of noteworthy formations and exposures that resulted from these factors. Answer: The Cretaceous period is characterized by unique factors that contributed to the formation of chalk and deposition of sedimentary layers. The narrowing of the Tethys Sea to the north of Africa, along with advancing and then receding shallow seas across central North America and Europe, led to the creation of thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. The Cretaceous period is also famous for its chalk formation, more so than any other period in the Phanerozoic. One of the primary reasons for the increased formation of chalk during this time was the activity of mid-ocean ridges. The circulation of seawater through these enlarged ridges enriched the oceans in calcium, resulting in increased saturation of calcium and its bioavailability for calcareous nanoplankton. This subsequently led to the widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits, making the Cretaceous rock record particularly exceptional. Some of the most famous formations from this period in North America include the rich marine fossils found in Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Additionally, important Cretaceous exposures have also been discovered in Europe and China. In the region now known as India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down during the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene, further signifying the unique geological activity during the Cretaceous period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question 1: How should I approach guy I like? Question 2: How do I approach a guy? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"First, let's analyze both questions: Question 1: How should I approach the guy I like? This question is specific to the person that the asker has feelings for. Question 2: How do I approach a guy? This question is more general and could apply to any guy, not necessarily someone the asker has feelings for. Although both questions are about approaching a guy, the context and the goal are different. However, the general principles of approaching someone may still apply to both situations. So, the answer to these two questions might not be exactly the same, but they could have overlapping advice and steps. Here are some tips for each situation. Answer to Question 1: How should I approach the guy I like? Step 1: Observe his interests and hobbies. This will give you a common ground to start a conversation.  Step 2: Try to become friends first. Building a strong friendship can be a foundation for a romantic relationship.  Step 3: Show genuine interest in his life and thoughts. This will help you connect on a deeper level and show that you are genuinely interested in what he has to say.  Step 4: Look for mutual friends and social settings to interact. Having mutual friends and spending time together in a group can help create a relaxed environment for getting to know each other better.  Step 5: Be yourself and be confident. Confidence is attractive, and being honest and authentic is essential to building a solid connection. Answer to Question 2: How do I approach a guy? Step 1: Start with a friendly greeting or casual conversation. This can break the ice and make the interaction feel less intimidating.  Step 2: Find a common ground for conversation. Discuss shared interests or hobbies to keep the conversation flowing naturally.  Step 3: Be a good listener and ask open-ended questions. This will show that you're engaged in the conversation and encourage the guy to share more about himself.  Step 4: Be approachable and relaxed. Displaying a positive and approachable demeanor will make the interaction more comfortable for both of you. Step 5: Be respectful and considerate. Regardless of the context, it's essential to treat the person with respect and kindness. In conclusion, the answers to the two questions have similarities in basic communication skills and building a connection; however, the context and goals differ, leading to slight differences in the approach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does \\"machinery\\" mean the same thing in these two sentences? The complex machinery of negotiation. The machinery of command labored and brought forth an order.","output":"The phrase \\"machinery\\" in both sentences carries similar yet subtly different connotations depending on the context it is used. The core concept behind both is the same; machinery in this sense is a metaphorical usage denoting systems or processes, rather than the literal meaning of physical equipment with moving parts. It signifies a complex and established procedure consisting of many parts, much like a machine.  1) \\"The complex machinery of negotiation.\\" In this context, \\"machinery\\" is used to describe the intricate process of negotiation. It can include a wide variety of elements such as the strategic planning involved, the discussions that take place, the methods used for problem-solving, the tactics employed for persuading or influencing others, and the steps necessary for reaching a favorable solution or agreement. The word \\"complex\\" infers that this process is not straightforward or simple; it involves various moving parts that are all interconnected, just like the inner workings of a mechanical machine. There is a 'mechanics' to the way negotiations work, a certain 'giv-and-take', strategic movements, subtle manipulations, and these are presented metaphorically as the machinery of negotiation. 2) \\"The machinery of command labored and brought forth an order.\\" Here, \\"machinery\\" has been employed to personify the process through which a command is issued. This process might involve decision making at various levels, discussions among superiors, strategic deliberation, compliance with regulations or protocols, drafting the command, and finally, executing or issuing it. The phrase \\"labored and brought forth an order\\" suggests this process is not immediate or easy, it required effort and work, similar to a machine being laboriously operated to produce a certain output — in this case, an order.  So, whilst \\"machinery\\" is used metaphorically to represent a system or process in both sentences, the process it is referring to is different based on the context: the first being the system of negotiation and the second being the system through which command operates. It shows the versatility of the word 'machinery' in terms of adapting to various contexts to express the idea of a systematic and orderly process with many sub-components."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

EA Sports Active More Workouts video game review EA has released its new home exercise game for the Nintendo Wii: Ea Sports Active More Workouts New workouts and new routines: the new game includes more stretching exercises Still fun: Like the first game, EA Sports Active More Workouts maintains the good balance of having fun while exercising Feel the burn: There are more exercises to target the stomach muscles in this iteration One-handed: More workouts offers some new and creative uses of the game's resistance strap Format: Wii Developer: EA Canada Publisher: EA Sports Released: Out now Score: 8/10 Ever since Wii Fit (and later Wii Fit Plus) demonstrated that there were oodles of cash to be made from fitness applications, developers have been falling over themselves to create the next big workout video game. It now seems that a new fitness title is released every other month. While their sheer numbers certainly prove that this genre of game has become big business, no game of this type has yet presented a credible challenge to the Wii Fit franchise's dominance of this market. The only title that has come anywhere near close is EA Sports Active which was released earlier this year and has since sold nearly two million units. Now, with the festive season upon us, and the promise of an ever expanding girth brought on by parties, dinners and calorie-rich Christmas pudding, EA has released a sequel in the form of EA Sports Active More Workouts. If the title seems unimaginative, take heart in the fact that at least this fitness game does exactly what it says on the box. EA Sports Active More Workouts doesn't really offer an experience that differs all that much from its predecessor. Rather, it builds on the solid foundations of EA Sports Active, while expanding its content to include larger workout challenges, stretching and cool-down periods and exercises that target more areas of the body. The overall formula here is the same as before; players use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck in conjunction with a resistance strap and a leg band to perform exercises that are aimed at toning muscles and burning fat. At the time of this writing, EA Sports Active More Workouts is only available as a stand-alone entity; newcomers to the franchise will have to fork over around £15 for the game's accessories, which are currently sold separately. It's unclear at this time whether it will ever be sold as a bundle, but the cost of EA Sports Active: More Workouts and the EA Sports Active accessory pack add up to the same cost as the first game anyway. Veterans, for their part, will save a little bit of cash and will be able to import their fitness profile from EA Sports Active over to their new game. Aside from a couple of tweaks, the experience of exercising is the same as before. Players tuck the Nunchuck into the pocket of the leg-strap in order to perform exercises below the waist (such as lunges) and most of the longer cardio exercises. The Wii Remote and Nunchuck are used for upper body exercises, both on their own (for cardio boxing or squash) and with the resistance strap for toning exercises (bicep curls, lateral raises and so forth). There is the option to use a balance board, although owning one isn't essential to play the game. Each exercise is introduced with a brief video in which the player is shown what to do and also what position to stand in. Players can set the difficulty of their exercises as well as set goals for burning calories or hours spent working out. All throughout the workouts, the players will be encouraged by a virtual trainer whose gender they can pick from the start, and whose psychotically cheerful demeanour will eventually cause them to fantasise about hurling a brick through their television's screen. With the core experience basically untouched, EA Sports Active More Workouts differs from it predecessor by the depth of new content and a handful of cosmetic changes. Owners of the first game will notice a couple of tweaks right from the loading screen; the soundtrack is a little more sedate and all of the scenery has changed. The avatars now mirror the player's activities in an island paradise which not only looks better than the slightly bland track and field environment from the first game, it also offers some new activities. Another big change is that the first game's 30-day challenge has been replaced by a new 6-week challenge, presumably to increase the possibility that exercising in the living room will become more of a long-term commitment. Once again, the challenge also encourages players to fill in details about their daily diet and activities to help build up a more accurate trajectory of their progress. However, all set workouts now have warm up and cool down periods, which corrects a potentially harmful omission from the first game – especially for players who habitually worked out on the hardest settings. The new game offers around 35 new exercises in total; some are evolutions of exercises in EA Sports Active (such as cardio boxing with moving targets) and some are only available with the balance board (such as step-ups). There are also a lot of brand new exercises which use the peripherals in new and interesting ways and allow players to target areas of muscles on their bodies. Probably the most noticeable collection of new exercises – which were conspicuous by their absence in the first game – are those that target stomach muscles such as crunches and (horrendous) leg raises. There are also a large selection of exercises which take advantage of the game's tropical paradise setting such as water skiing, paddle surfing and obstacle courses involving flotation devices. Unfortunately EA Sports Active More Workouts carries over a couple of gameplay drawbacks from the original title. The Nunchuck and Wii sometimes takes longer to register one leg than the other during lunge exercises. The journal entries are improved somewhat, but they're still too just general to offer any worthwhile nutritional advice and the workouts have too much of a heavy reliance on calorie counting. As far as the peripherals are concerned, the fabric leg-strap is still a solid piece of kit, but the resistance strap is fairly useless as a toning implement. It's a shame that the new game doesn't offer a better peripheral that could actually help build muscle on the upper part of the body – especially when the rest of the game seems to offer a more well-rounded exercising experience than its predecessor. The only other problem the game has is that it may seem like a bit of a cash-grab to anyone who bought the first instalment in the series; asking full price for what could be offered as DLC (at a substantially lower cost) on either Xbox Live or PSN may cause a little consternation. Then again, maybe not. The arrival of EA Sports Active More Workouts barely six months after its predecessor hasn't caused fans of the original to start a boycott, after all - which if anything proves fitness games just don't have the same hold over players as zombie shooters. Niggles aside, it's a huge improvement on EA Sports Active. While EA hasn't tinkered too much with the foundations of the franchise, the tweaks, tucks and additional content make EA Sports Active More Workouts feel like a far more effective fitness package than its predecessor. For players who want to work up a sweat in front of their consoles it's one of the best titles available. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"EA Sports Active More Workouts is a new exercise video game for Nintendo Wii. It has more workouts and routines, including stretching exercises, stomach muscle targeting, and creative uses of the game's resistance strap. The game keeps the fun aspect of exercising while offering new settings and activities. Some improvements have been made compared to the previous game, but there are still some drawbacks. The game is a good option for people who want to work up a sweat while playing video games."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: -  The heated water evaporates - The salt is left behind - The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface - The evaporated water is collected - The process is repeated - More salt is removed from the water.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is heating the saltwater mixture. This process is essential in separating the salt from the water by taking advantage of their different physical properties, specifically their boiling points. Water has a boiling point of 100°C (212°F) under normal atmospheric pressure, whereas salt has a much higher boiling point, around 801°C (1,474°F). By heating the saltwater mixture, the water will turn into vapor while the salt remains in its solid state due to their distinct boiling points. This step is carried out by heating the saltwater mixture in a container until the water reaches its boiling point and begins to evaporate. The heat source can be a stove, a heating plate, or even sunlight when using a solar still. This process should be done at a controlled heat so as not to overheat the mixture, which could potentially cause splattering or structural damage to the container. As the water evaporates, it leaves the salt behind in the container in the form of solid crystals. It is essential to constantly monitor the evaporation process to ensure that the salt does not contaminate the evaporated water. This is achieved through an appropriate barrier or setup allowing the water vapor to travel away from the salt residue. Once the water evaporates and separates from the salt, it must be condensed back into its liquid form through a cooling process. This step usually involves directing the water vapor to a cold surface, such as a glass or metal lid, where it will cool down and transform into liquid. The condensation process is crucial as it purifies the water, making it free from the salt contaminants. After the water has condensed and formed droplets on the cold surface, it is then collected in a separate container. This newly collected water is now free from salt and other impurities that are left behind during the heating and evaporation process. The entire process of heating, evaporating, condensing, and collecting water is repeated multiple times to remove any remaining traces of salt or other impurities. This ensures that the final product is clean and pure water, making it suitable for drinking, irrigation, and various other uses. In summary, the first step of the process of removing salt from water is heating the saltwater mixture. This step enables the separation of salt from water by exploiting their different boiling points, ultimately resulting in the evaporation of the water, leaving the salt behind in solid form. The entire process must be repeated several times to ensure complete removal of salt from the water, providing purified water for multiple applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the given short movie review, the statement \\"will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one\\" indicates that the critic had an unfavorable experience while watching the movie in question. They believe that the film was not enjoyable or engaging enough to warrant a visit to the theater and suggests that the audience would have been better off watching a different movie at home. This negative sentiment could stem from various aspects of the movie, such as poor plot development, unconvincing acting, or subpar production quality. The critic might also feel that the movie failed to meet their expectations, perhaps due to misleading marketing or high anticipation. Regardless of the specific reasons behind their dissatisfaction, it is clear from the review that the critic did not have a positive experience with the movie in question. To summarize, the critic's thoughts on the movie are negative (Option A) because their review implies that the movie was not worth the time and effort required to watch it in a theater setting. Instead, they suggest that the audience's time would be better spent watching a different movie at home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer. Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel. When his opponents arrive at the appointed place, they are amused to discover they are all engaged to cross swords with the same man. However, Cardinal Richelieu's Guards try to arrest the Musketeers for dueling. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered trio and acquits himself well.

A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, said the detainees selected for release were “noncriminals and other low-risk offenders who do not have serious criminal histories.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Officials said the releases, which began last week and continued on Tuesday, were a response to the possibility of automatic governmentwide budget cuts, known as sequestration, which are scheduled to take effect on Friday.      “As fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICE’s current budget,” the agency’s spokeswoman, Gillian M. Christensen, said in a statement. The agency’s budget for custody operations in the current fiscal year is 2.05 billion, officials said, and as of Saturday, ICE was holding 30,773 people in its detention system.      Immigration officials said Tuesday that they had no plans to release substantially more detainees this week, though they warned that more releases were still possible depending on the outcome of budget negotiations.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      They refused to specify exactly how many detainees were released, or where the releases took place. But immigrants’ advocates around the country have reported that detainees were freed in several places, including Hudson County, N.J.; Polk County, Tex.; Broward County, Fla.; New Orleans; and from centers in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia and New York.

One such group, the National Immigration Forum, estimated last year that it cost from 122 to 164 a day to hold a detainee in the federal immigration system. In contrast, the organization said, alternative forms of detention could cost from 30 cents to 14 a day per immigrant.

Among those released in the past week was Anthony Orlando Williams, 52, a Jamaican immigrant who spent nearly three years in a detention center in Georgia. “I’m good, man,” he said. “I’m free.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Mr. Williams, in a telephone interview from Stone Mountain, Ga., said he became an illegal immigrant when he overstayed a visa in 1991. He was detained in 2010 by a sheriff’s deputy in Gwinnett County, Ga., when it was discovered that he had violated probation for a conviction in 2005 of simple assault, simple battery and child abuse, charges that sprung from a domestic dispute with his wife at the time. He was transferred to ICE custody and has been fighting a deportation order with the help of Families for Freedom, an immigrant support group in New York.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Mr. Williams was released last Friday. “That was a long, long, long run,” he said of his detention, adding that he has an appointment this Friday at an immigration office in Atlanta at which he expects to receive the terms of his supervised release — “a list of things I have to abide by.”      Human Rights First, another advocacy group in New York, which has been pressing for reform of the immigration detention system, said that 96 percent of immigrants enrolled in ICE’s alternatives-to-detention program attended their final hearing in 2011. That figure was up from the year before, in which 93 percent attended their final court hearings, said the group, citing statistics provided by B.I., a private contractor that provides monitoring and supervision services to ICE.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story      But Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is also holding immigration hearings, said the releases “lessened the chances” that legislators might reach a bipartisan accord on comprehensive immigration reform.      “It is clear the administration is using the sequester as a convenient excuse to bow to political pressure from the amnesty groups,” he said. “With this new action, the administration has further demonstrated that it has no commitment to enforcing the law and cannot be trusted to deliver on any future promises of enforcement.”      Other Republicans, however, shrugged off the releases, saying they expected that the administration would use the excuse of sequestration to take attention-grabbing action and that they were prepared for more in the coming days. ||||| A week before mandatory budget cuts go into effect across the government, the Department of Homeland Security has started releasing illegal immigrants being held in immigration jails across the country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday.      Gillian Christensen, an ICE spokeswoman, said ICE has reviewed \\"several hundred cases\\" of immigrants being held in jails around the country and released them in the last week. They have been \\"placed on an appropriate, more cost-effective form of supervised release,\\" she said.      Christensen said the agency's \\"priority for detention remains on serious criminal offenders and other individuals who pose a significant threat to public safety.\\" She did not say how released immigrants were selected or what jails they were released from.      Tuesday's announcement of jail releases is the first tangible impact of the looming budget cuts for DHS.      The Obama administration has been issuing dire warnings about the impact of the sequestration and DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters at the White House Monday that across-the-board cuts would impact the department's core operations, including border security and airport screening operations.      She also warned that DHS might not be able to afford to keep the 34,000 immigration jail beds mandated by Congress. On average last week, there were 30,773 people being held in ICE jails.      \\"I don't think we can maintain the same level of security at all places around the country with sequester as without sequester,\\" said Napolitano, adding that the impact would be \\"\`like a rolling ball. It will keep growing.\\"      According to the National Immigration Forum, it costs the government about 164 a day to keep an illegal immigrant facing deportation jailed. In a report on immigration detention costs last year the advocacy group said costs for supervised release can range from about 30 cents to 14 a day.      Republicans lawmakers decried the releases Tuesday.      \\"It's abhorrent that President (Barack) Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration,\\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte. \\"By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the Administration is needlessly endangering American lives. It also undermines our efforts to come together with the Administration and reform our nation's immigration laws.\\"      The administration asked for about 1.96 billion for immigration jail operations in the last budget. It amounts to about 5.4 million a day, according to the National Immigration Forum's report.      Christensen said Tuesday that released immigrants will still face deportation proceedings. ||||| The Obama administration announced Tuesday that it had released hundreds of illegal immigrants held in detention facilities, saying it could no longer afford to house them because of across-the-board cuts that are set to start taking effect Friday.      Federal authorities said that the detainees continue to face immigration charges, that they are being monitored and that violent offenders will not be let go.      The unusual action came as much of Washington plotted strategy for managing the deep cuts, known as sequestration, and for winning the political battle over them.      President Obama flew to Newport News to highlight the effect the reductions would have on the defense industry, saying they would harm a facility that builds nuclear submarines. Other top administration officials joined in, with Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. bluntly declaring in a speech, “The American people are going to be less safe.”      Politically, the president seemed to be trying to cause a split between Republican lawmakers who are set against raising taxes as part of a compromise to avoid the spending cuts and those who are open to the idea.      You’ve heard the word “sequester” mentioned by politicians a lot lately. The Washington Post’s Ed O’Keefe explains what the term means, and why it matters. (The Washington Post)      Obama heralded Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) for endorsing an overhaul of the tax code that raises new revenue, bringing him to Newport News on Air Force One. He also met later in the day with Republican Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and John McCain (Ariz.), who have signaled that they would be open to more taxes as part of a broader compromise that also overhauled entitlements.      But GOP leaders showed no such interest Tuesday. House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) lashed out at Obama, saying he was exploiting members of the armed services to achieve political aims.      “I don’t think the president’s focused on trying to find a solution to the sequester,” he said at a news conference. “The president has been traveling all over the country and today [is] going down to Newport News in order to use our military men and women as a prop in yet another campaign rally to support his tax hikes.”      With the sequester all but certain to begin Friday, Republicans and Democrats were positioning for a longer brawl that would last until at least late March, when a stopgap measure that funds the government expires.      The administration has acknowledged that the full brunt of the sequester wouldn’t be felt until near then, and both sides are looking to that battle to determine whether the cuts remain — and whether the government shuts down.      Senate Democrats are planning to advance a proposal before Friday that would halt much of the across-the-board reductions through the end of the year and replace them with a combination of other cuts and tax increases, including a new minimum tax rate for those making more than 5 million a year. It is not expected to get the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster.      Republicans are divided about their strategy. Senate Republicans had planned to push for a bill that would preserve the 85 billion in cuts for this fiscal year but give the administration greater flexibility in how to manage them.      But McCain, Graham and other GOP senators say they oppose handing over the appropriations power, usually the domain of Congress, to the White House, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said Tuesday that Republicans are still plotting their legislative strategy. In any case, Democrats are expected to reject any GOP proposal that would leave the scale of the cuts intact.      Obama seems intent on capitalizing on divisions within the GOP. In Newport News, he said more Republicans need to follow in the footsteps of Rigell and McCain.      “I’ve got to give Scott Rigell credit. He is one of your Republican congressmen who’s with us here today — and that’s not always healthy for a Republican, being with me,” Obama said. “But the reason he’s doing it is because he knows it’s important to you. And he’s asked his colleagues in the House to consider closing tax loopholes instead of letting these automatic cuts go through.”      Rigell told reporters on Air Force One that although the country needs to cut spending, “I also believe that revenue has to come up a bit, first by growing the economy, but also by tax reform, which also includes eliminating lobbyist-inspired, lobbyist-written loopholes.”      Republican leaders seemed uninterested, though, and announced that their first big bill of the year would be an overhaul of the tax code that would not raise the overall tax burden. In exchange for scaling back tax breaks, Republicans plan to lower rates.      “I’m not interested in new revenue at this point,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) said Tuesday.      With its decision to release detainees in immigration facilities, the Obama administration sought to make clear the impact of the sequester.      The move drew heavy GOP criticism. “The last thing you would do to meet a budget cut of this size would be to voluntarily undertake actions that undermine the rule of law and endanger the public safety,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.).      House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) said in an interview on CBS, “I, frankly, think this is outrageous.”      Historically, many illegal immigrants released from federal detention centers while in deportation proceedings do not show up for subsequent court appearances, joining the ranks of what the Immigration and Customs Enforcement calls absconders or “fugitive aliens.”      The agency has estimated that detention costs 122 per bed per day. It has been under pressure by immigration advocacy and civil rights groups to rely on cheaper detention alternatives for those in deportation proceedings who do not pose a security threat. More cost-effective alternatives include electronic ankle-bracelet monitoring, telephone monitoring and community-based monitoring programs.      In a news briefing Monday before the releases were announced, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano indicated that sequestration would affect detention policy. “I’m supposed to have 34,000 detention beds for immigration,” she said. “How do I pay for those?”      William Branigin, Sari Horwitz, Paul Kane, Lori Montgomery and Tara Bahrampour contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The Department of Homeland Security has released several hundred illegal immigrants from detention centers in response to the possibility of automatic government-wide budget cuts, known as sequestration.

Three of the victims are connected to the university's famed football program. NBC's Thanh Truong reports.      Updated at 3:05 p.m. ET: Three people were killed and three others wounded in a shooting during a party at an apartment complex near Auburn University, Alabama authorities said Sunday. Among the dead were two Auburn students who had been on the football team.      A manhunt was underway Sunday for suspected gunman, identified by police as Desmonte Leonard, 22, of Montgomery, Ala.      The dead were Edward Christian, 20, a football player who was out this season due to injuries; Ladarious Phillips, 20, a former football player; and Demario Pitts, 20, of Auburn.      The shooting happened late Saturday night at the University Heights apartments, a large complex near campus where many of Auburn University's students and athletes live. Leonard is suspected of pulling a gun after a fight broke out, shooting six before fleeing, Auburn Police Chief Tommy Dawson said at a news conference on Sunday.      When police arrived, Christian was found dead on the sidewalk. Phillips and Pitts were transported to the hospital, where they later died.      Among the three wounded is John Robertson, 20, who is fighting for his life after being shot in the head, Dawson said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon. Xavier Moss, 19, was released from the hospital and Eric Mack, 20, was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.

Police believe Leonard drove away from the scene in a white Chevrolet Caprice, which was later found abandoned.      \\"I don't believe it was targeted. It was a fight and someone got carried away,\\" Dawson said of the shooting. \\"I don't like the word random when it comes to shootings, but it was a fight that obviously got out of hand.\\"      Asked about connections to the football team, Dawson said, \\"The only connection to the football team is that they are the victims of a brutal shooting. Sometimes the young men get a bad rap, I feel, but they're the victims today.\\"      \\"This is a sad, sad day for everyone associated with the entire Auburn family. I am devastated by the passing of three young men, including two that I personally knew in Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips and my heart goes out to their families,\\" Auburn coach Coach Gene Chizik said in a statement. \\"My thoughts and prayers are with their families and all of the victims involved in this tragic incident. Nobody should ever have to endure such unimaginable grief, and we will love and support the victims' families during this terribly difficult time. We have a lot of people on our football team that are hurting right now and we're going to do everything we can to help them get through this.\\"      AP Photo/Auburn Police Division This undated photo provided by the Auburn Police Division shows Desmonte Leonard, 22, of Montgomery, Ala., the suspect wanted for fatally shooting three people, including two former Auburn University football players, and wounding another three people during a party at an apartment complex near the school.

Some bystanders milled about, looking on at the scene.      An Auburn police dispatcher contacted by The Associated Press said early Sunday she had no immediate information. Police did not immediately return repeated telephone messages seeking comment.      Auburn University campus police said they had no information and referred calls to city police.      Vasha Hunt, a photographer with the Opelika-Auburn News, was at the apartment complex hours earlier and told the AP by telephone before dawn that authorities had set up a white tent there where there was a lot of activity. He said police kept a number of bystanders back for hours away from the scene.      Hunt said at least some of those who initially gathered outside appeared to be residents waiting for permission to enter their apartments.      ___      Associated Press writers Bob Johnson and John Zenor contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Three people were killed and three others injured during a shooting at a party near Auburn University in Alabama.

Here is an article: The innuendo-filled Magic Mike XXL, out Wednesday, is anything but subtle, but we knew that from the film’s extended promotion. The hashtag the studio used to promote the film is #comeagain, in some posters placed over star Channing Tatum’s pelvic area. One teaser shot featured Tatum with sparks literally emitting from his groin. Another showed Joe Manganiello (Sofia Vergara’s fiancée) thrusting a water bottle in front of his crotch, sending liquid flying through the air. The film is one phallus after another. Its stars are blatantly, hilariously subjecting themselves to what women like Vergara experience on a regular basis (like at last year’s Emmys): objectification. Manganiello and Tatum are helping to usher in an era of “man-jectification,” in which women can judge men’s bodies openly — the way their male counterparts have long done for women. Any woman in the public eye, from actors to politicians, can expect to have their looks critiqued, discussed, made object. That’s the way it’s always been. There were always handsome leading men, but they were rarely subject to the same scrutiny as women. Men still take most of the major lead roles — in 2014 just 12% of movie protagonists in the top 100 grossing films were women, according to the Center for Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University — while women are relegated to being sex objects. Male directors who dominate the industry shoot films from the male perspective, allowing the camera to linger on beautiful women and judge them. But Tatum struck gold with 2012’s Magic Mike, which he wrote, by turning the camera on himself; the movie made 113.7 million at the box office. At its heart, Magic Mike was a drama about the recession, and about a man struggling to gain his independence — from the stripper pole, from his boss and from a world of drugs. Nobody remembers it as that. Audiences dubbed it “the stripper movie,” and groups of women and gay men crowded into theaters to see Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey’s guns, six packs and even butts. It’s no wonder then that Magic Mike XXL has dispensed with all the darkness of its predecessor in favor of becoming a pec-filled romp. Manjectification is taking place on the little screen, too. In the final episodes of Fox’s Last Man on Earth, the women on the show fawned over a ripped newcomer (Boris Kodjoe) and schemed for ways to sleep with him as he repaired various appliances. These episodes came after a long and almost unbearable run in which the main character, Phil (Will Forte), cursed his luck for having agreed to marry a nagging woman (Kristen Schaal) before a hot blonde (January Jones) to show up on the scene. The joke of the series was Phil getting a taste of his own medicine, but it was a reversal not often seen on television. Tatum and Kodjoe are voluntarily submitting to the objectification, of course, and they’re in on the joke. But other men are beginning to experience what women have for years. In March, Game of Thrones star Kit Harington complained about being objectified by the media. Unlike the Magic Mike actors who are, more often than not, shirtless in the films, Harington’s costume on the fantasy show involved so many bulky layers of fur that sleeping he might be confused with a dire wolf. And the pressure on male actors seems to be building. In order to get your own Marvel movie franchise, you’ve got to be prepared for the inevitable shirtlessness. Comedians Chris Pratt and Paul Rudd shed extra pounds for six-pack abs for Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, respectively. (No woman will get her own Marvel franchise until Captain Marvel in 2017.) Of course, the strain on male actors hardly equates to what female actors suffer. This was captured best when comedian Amy Schumer parodied 12 Angry Men on her show, in which a jury of dudes determines whether she is hot enough to be on television. Rather than assessing her comedy, the men mull whether — if they were a little drunk and had their glasses off — they might contemplate masturbating to Schumer’s blurry blonde image on the TV. Is turnabout fair play? Magic Mike XXL seems to think so. In the film, Jada Pinkett Smith asks women if they’re ready to be worshipped. Donald Glover says that male strippers are “healers.” Naked men, they reason, make women feel good and perhaps are some small recompense for how women have been treated. It’s hard to imagine a female stripper film where the characters could make the same argument about women being healers — can you imagine the same of Showgirls, Strip Tease or Coyote Ugly? None of those movies had the high-minded aspirations of Magic Mike. And after this one premieres, Channing Tatum will still be able to return to dramatic roles like the one he had in Foxcatcher. Women who strip for the camera don’t always engender such steadfast or serious support. But in some small way, XXL does try to hand power back to the female viewer, and man-jectification may just be balancing the scales. Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Magic Mike XXL and the Era of Man-jectification: How Men Are Becoming Objects Too\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The enzyme pepsin is released by cells in which part of the human body? What is the answer?","output":"Pepsin is a crucial enzyme released by cells in the stomach, specifically by the chief cells of the gastric glands. The stomach is a part of the human digestive system, responsible for breaking down food and preparing it for further processing in the small intestine. The process of pepsin secretion starts with the production of an inactive precursor called pepsinogen in the chief cells. Pepsinogen is secreted into the gastric lumen, the open space within the stomach where the mixing and digestion of food occur. Once inside the gastric lumen, pepsinogen encounters the acidic environment created by hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is produced by the parietal cells of the gastric glands. The highly acidic milieu (with a pH of around 1.5 to 3.5) triggers the transformation of inactive pepsinogen into the active form, pepsin. Pepsin as an enzyme is specialized in breaking down proteins present in ingested food. It acts mainly on the peptide bonds found within proteins, converting them into smaller peptides called peptones. The enzymatic action of pepsin is most efficient in the acidic environment of the stomach, which ensures the proper unfolding of these protein molecules, making them more accessible for enzymatic breakdown. After the initial breakdown by pepsin, the partially digested proteins and peptides enter the small intestine, where they undergo further degradation by additional enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidases. This process ultimately results in the formation of amino acids, which are then absorbed and used by the human body for various physiological processes, including growth, repair, and maintenance of tissues. In summary, pepsin is a vital enzyme produced and released by the chief cells in the stomach of the human body. It plays a significant role in protein digestion by converting proteins into smaller peptides in the acidic gastric environment. This initial breakdown is later followed by further digestion in the small intestine, ultimately leading to the production of vital amino acids needed for various critical bodily functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? . To make a great tattoo, put some thought into its design before you apply it to your skin. Use a regular pencil and paper to sketch out some ideas, keeping the following pointers in mind:  Your eyeliner tattoo will look best with bold, simple strokes. Finer lines and more complicated designs could be more likely to smudge and become unrecognizable. Stick with clear shapes. Decide how large you want it to be. A bigger tattoo may be more likely to appear to be hand drawn, whereas a smaller tattoo may look more \\"authentic.\\" Design your tattoo according to the effect you want to achieve. . Go to the drugstore and buy a simple eyeliner pencil, the type that needs to be sharpened. Pick one that isn't meant to be shiny or oily; a pencil that makes smooth, dry marks will make a longer-lasting smudge-free tattoo.  Jet black eyeliner makes for a striking temporary tattoo, but there's no reason not to choose more than one color. Try emerald, purple, and sapphire to create your design or add a small accent. Avoid liquid eyeliner. It's more difficult to keep this type of eyeliner in place on parts of your body other than your eyelids.  Practice drawing your design with your chosen eyeliner pencils on paper. Get used to the pressure you need to exert to create smooth strokes.","output":"For a great temporary tattoo, sketch a bold and simple design, use a dry, smudge-free eyeliner pencil in your desired color, and practice drawing on paper before applying it on your skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the first names of the four members of Germs?  Jan Paul Beahm grows up in Los Angeles through a troubled childhood; he does not know his biological father, his mother is an alcoholic, and his older brother dies from a heroin overdose. He is an avid reader and develops into a \\"frighteningly intelligent\\" student at University High School, where his antisocial behavior leads the administration to give him straight A's if he agrees not to return. In December 1975, at age 17, he proposes to his friend Georg Ruthenberg that they start a band, showing him potential lyrics and claiming to have a \\"five-year plan\\" inspired by the David Bowie song \\"Five Years\\". They recruit Terri Ryan, Belinda Carlisle, and Becky Barton for the group and con money for instruments. Jan Paul comes up with the name Germs, representing the germination of an idea. He sings while Georg plays guitar, Terri plays bass guitar, and Becky plays drums. The Germs play their first gig on April 16, 1977. As they are heckling the Damned outside the Whisky a Go Go, Claude \\"Kickboy Face\\" Bessy of Slash magazine suggests that they perform at an open mic across the street. The Germs give an impromptu performance of their song \\"Sex Boy\\", but do not know how to play their instruments and are heckled by the audience. Jan Paul responds by throwing flour at them and dipping the microphone in peanut butter; the band is thrown out but excited by the experience. Jan Paul comes up with pseudonyms for the members: Georg becomes Pat Smear, Terri becomes Lorna Doom, and Becky becomes Donna Rhia, while Belinda bows out of the band. Jan Paul renames himself Bobby Pyn, but soon changes this to Darby Crash. Becky is soon kicked out and the band goes through a series of replacements. Chris Ashford becomes their manager and presses their \\"Forming\\" single, the first punk rock single from Los Angeles.

It flows through County Durham in England.  - Middlesbrough is a large industrial town on the south bank of the River Tees in North East England, founded in 1830. The local council, a unitary authority, is Middlesbrough Borough Council. In 2011 it had a total resident population of 138,400 for the borough and 174,700 for the wider Middlesbrough built-up area subdivision, which itself is part of the larger built-up area of Teesside and had an overall population of 376,333 at the 2011 census.  - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\".  - The River Tyne is a river in North East England and its length (excluding tributaries) is . It is formed by the confluence of two rivers: the North Tyne and the South Tyne. These two rivers converge at Warden Rock near Hexham in Northumberland at a place dubbed 'The Meeting of the Waters'.  - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England.  - The River Tees is in northern England. It rises on the eastern slope of Cross Fell in the North Pennines, and flows eastwards for to reach the North Sea between Hartlepool and Redcar near Middlesbrough.  - Gateshead is a large town in Tyne and Wear, England, and the main settlement in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. The local authority of Gateshead is also the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. Gateshead lay in the County of County Durham. In 1835 it became part of the Gateshead County Borough. After the Local Government Act 1972, in 1974, Gateshead became part of the Gateshead Metropolitan Borough local authority, and part of the Tyne & Wear Metropolitan County. The town lies on the southern bank of the River Tyne opposite Newcastle upon Tyne. Gateshead and Newcastle are joined by seven bridges across the Tyne, including the Gateshead Millennium Bridge. The town is known for its architecture, including the Sage Gateshead, the Angel of the North and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. Residents of Gateshead, like the rest of Tyneside, are referred to as Geordies. Gateshead's population in 2011 was 120,046.  - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham.  - The regions (formerly known as the Government Office Regions; GORs) are the highest tier of sub-national division in England. Between 1994 and 2011, nine regions had officially devolved functions within Government. While they no longer fulfil this role, they continue to be used for statistical and some administrative purposes. They define areas (constituencies) for the purposes of elections to the European Parliament. Eurostat also uses them to demarcate first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\\"NUTS 1 regions\\") within the European Union. The regions generally follow the boundaries of the former standard regions, established in the 1940s for statistical purposes.  - Cumbria (; locally ) is a non-metropolitan county in North West England. The county and Cumbria County Council, its local government, came into existence in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. Cumbria's county town is Carlisle, in the north of the county, and the only other major urban area is Barrow-in-Furness on the southwestern tip of the county.  - The City of Sunderland is a local government district of Tyne and Wear, in North East England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Sunderland, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, Washington, and a range of suburban villages.  - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington.  - South Tyneside is a metropolitan borough in Tyne and Wear in North East England.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions.  - Darlington is a large market town in County Durham, in North East England, and part of the Tees Valley. With a population of 106,000 in 2011, the town lies on the River Skerne, a tributary of the River Tees.

The town is often colloquially referred to as 'Darlo'.  - North West England, one of nine official regions of England, consists of the five counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. The North West had a population of 7,052,000 in 2011. It is the third most populated region in the United Kingdom after the South East and Greater London.  - The Gateshead Millennium Bridge is a pedestrian and cyclist tilt bridge spanning the River Tyne in England between Gateshead's Quays arts quarter on the south bank, and the Quayside of Newcastle upon Tyne on the north bank. Opened for public use in 2001, the award-winning structure was conceived and designed by architect Wilkinson Eyre and structural engineer Gifford. The bridge is sometimes referred to as the 'Blinking Eye Bridge' or the 'Winking Eye Bridge' due to its shape and its tilting method. In terms of height, the Gateshead Millennium Bridge is slightly shorter than the neighbouring Tyne Bridge, and stands as the sixteenth tallest structure in the city.  - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.  - Tyne and Wear is a metropolitan county in the North East region of England around the mouths of the rivers Tyne and Wear. It came into existence in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. It consists of the five metropolitan boroughs of South Tyneside, North Tyneside, City of Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead and City of Sunderland. It is bounded on the east by the North Sea, and has borders with Northumberland to the north and County Durham to the south.  - The Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR) was a railway company that operated in north-east England from 1825 to 1863. The world's first public railway to use steam locomotives, its first line connected collieries near Shildon with Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington, and was officially opened on 27 September 1825. The movement of coal to ships rapidly became a lucrative business, and the line was soon extended to a new port and town at Middlesbrough. While coal waggons were hauled by steam locomotives from the start, passengers were carried in coaches drawn by horses until carriages hauled by steam locomotives were introduced in 1833.  - Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art (BALTIC) is an international centre for contemporary art located on the south bank of the River Tyne alongside the Gateshead Millennium Bridge in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in North East England, United Kingdom. It presents a constantly changing programme of exhibitions and events. It opened in 2002 in a converted flour mill. The Director is Sarah Munro who joined Baltic in November 2015. Munro is the first woman to hold the position of Director in the history of the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. BALTIC is a registered charity under English law.  - The metropolitan counties are a type of county-level administrative division of England. There are six metropolitan counties, which each cover large urban areas, typically with populations of 1.2 to 2.8 million. They were created in 1972 and are each divided into several metropolitan districts or boroughs.  - Northumberland is a county in North East England. The northernmost county of England, it borders Cumbria to the west, County Durham and Tyne and Wear to the south and Scotland to the north. To the east is the North Sea coastline with a long distance path. The county town is Alnwick although the county council is in Morpeth (for the moment, as there are plans to move it to nearby Ashington).

Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which researcher observed a large amount of surface warming?  Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature... The answer to this question is:","output":"Noah.  Here's the step-by-step logic: First, in the initial background information, it's stated that Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa.  Second, in the hint we're told about significant warming in Antarctica. It mentions that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive and that West Antarctica has warmed significantly in the last 50 years, especially in winter and spring. It also mentions a study noting that central West Antarctica is one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. Considering the information, it can be inferred that Noah, who researched the climate of Antarctica, witnessed a large amount of surface warming. Frank, who was researching Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa, is not mentioned in the hint, therefore leaving us with no reason to believe that he observed a large amount of surface warming.  Therefore, the researcher who observed a large amount of surface warming is Noah."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer: A Vietnamese American () is an American of Vietnamese descent. Question: where did the vietnamese settle in america The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer provides a definition for a Vietnamese American. However, to fully address the original question \\"Where did the Vietnamese settle in America?\\", here is a more detailed answer: After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, many Vietnamese refugees fled to the United States in search of a better life. The U.S. government sponsored various initiatives to assist these refugees in resettlement, which led to the establishment of several Vietnamese communities across the country. Significant Vietnamese populations settled in the following areas: 1. California - Vietnamese immigrants mainly settled in Southern California, particularly in Orange County, which is now home to one the largest Vietnamese communities outside of Vietnam called \\"Little Saigon.\\" The city of San Jose in Northern California also has a significant Vietnamese population. 2. Texas - Houston has one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the U.S. known as \\"Midtown\\" or \\"Little Saigon,\\" while Vietnamese-Americans also settled in Dallas, Austin, and other cities in Texas. 3. Louisiana - Many Vietnamese found the climate in New Orleans similar to their homeland, and settled in the areas of New Orleans East and Versailles. They mostly worked in the fishing industry. 4. Washington - Seattle's diverse International District also attracted Vietnamese immigrants, creating a flourishing Vietnamese community. 5. Virginia - Virginia's Vietnamese community is mainly concentrated in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., such as Falls Church, which also has a \\"Little Saigon.\\" 6. Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Oregon - These states also have notable Vietnamese communities, particularly in Boston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Portland, respectively. It's important to mention that Vietnamese immigrants and their descendants have continued to disperse throughout the United States, integrating into various cities and neighborhoods. As a result, there are now small enclaves of Vietnamese-Americans in several other major cities across the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Given the background: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  and the situation: Robin and Samantha are both bodybuilders preparing for a competition. Both of them are trying to change their skin complexion to help their appearances at the competition. Robin begins exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week. Samantha decides not to use any UV light and instead just uses lotion to help her skin.  Answer the following question: Who will produce lower amounts of melanin? Answer:","output":"Samantha will produce lower amounts of melanin in comparison to Robin. In the given background information, it is stated that exposure to UV light stimulates melanocyte cells to produce more melanin. Since Robin is exposing her skin to high amounts of UV light several days a week, her melanocytes will produce more melanin, resulting in a darker complexion. On the other hand, Samantha is not using any UV light and only relying on lotion to help her skin. As a result, her melanocyte cells will not be stimulated by UV light to produce more melanin, leading to lower melanin production and lighter skin complexion in comparison to Robin."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: CANCELED YET?

They despair when they watch their beloved spend much money on extra baggage charge. Nearly half of these women admitted to lying about the weight of their case to their partner before leaving for the airport, in fear of being made to unload some unnecessary items. But it's a fact that women pack more than they need. On average, a woman needs around 57 items in suitcase for a two-week holiday, yet most women pack nearer to 150 items, ranging from skirts, tops, underwear and high heels. In addition, women pack more sun cream, make-up and hair appliances than they were likely to need. They all take up space in the suitcase, only a third of them will see the light of day once at the holiday place. 79 percent of women admitted to taking extra items with them, with the reason for this being \\"just in case\\". Women plan their holiday wardrobe  months in advance. Packing enough clothes and other items to last a month is not enough for some women. They'd take a chance to shop for new items while holidaying abroad. So they'll return with even more luggage in their cases. Professor Karen Pine said: \\"Women are tempted to take familiar items with them on holiday, often everything except the kitchen sink. Some people find traveling stressful, particularly when they're unsure about the home comforts available at their holiday place. They over-pack to help cope with those feelings of stress and reduce the uncertainty.\\" This will come as no surprise to some men, who are used to trying to squeeze their partner's luggage into the boot of the car with their own, smaller case.

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved.

Background Paragraph: Rural development is the process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people living in rural areas, often relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas.[1] Rural development has traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers.[2] The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all play an important role in developing rural regions.[3] Rural development is also characterized by its emphasis on locally produced economic development strategies.[4] In contrast to urban regions, which have many similarities, rural areas are highly distinctive from one another. For this reason there are a large variety of rural development approaches used globally.[5] Rural development is a comprehensive term. It essentially focuses on action for the development of areas outside the mainstream urban economic system. we should think of what type of rural development is needed because modernization of village leads to urbanization and village environment disappears.  Story: Two rural communities from Jones county took different approaches on rural development as a means of adapting to increasing urbanization. Kent village remained  traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. The villagers of Long Grove on the other hand took a wider perspective and created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all played an important role in developing Long Grove village.

The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview.

Helen Harrison, Unison’s Rochdale branch secretary, said council staff have raised concerns. ‘People do have different views on it but there are a number of people who are upset about the unisex issue,’ she said. ‘I think what the council is looking at doing now is tallying up the. ratio of male and female workers on each floor and will split up the. toilets that way.’ Each floor of the building has around eight toilet. cubicles opening off a corridor, all currently with male and female. symbols on the door. 'They are fully enclosed with their own washing and drying facilities, rather than communal ones. Nevertheless some staff have apparently baulked at the idea of using cubicles frequented by members of the opposite sex. Last night Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance,. said: ‘It’s bizarre that council bosses pressed ahead with unisex loos. despite a clear lack of demand for them. ‘This is a perfect example of politically correct thinking trumping common sense at the expense of everyone else.’ Unisex toilets first entered the public consciousness in the 1990s. American TV series Ally McBeal where they were the setting for gossip. and romantic encounters between her lawyer colleagues. As a compromise, cubicles at Rochdale council’s building will now be allocated as male or female. Operational services director Mark Widdup said: ‘The building was. intended to have unisex toilets on the office floors, as is the norm in. many modern buildings. Controversy: The building was only equipped with unisex toilets rather than men's and women's. ‘However, based on staff feedback who have been based in the building. for several weeks and discussions with the unions, we’ve decided to. review these facilities.’ The building also houses the town’s new library and has space for. private firms. The council says it will save £1million a year by having. workers in one modern location as well as giving a better service to. local people. In 2010 there was amazement when Rochdale’s Exchange mall installed two. squat toilets after bosses were told some of the town’s Asian and. Eastern European communities preferred them. Rochdale is far from the only council to have wasted taxpayers' money on perks which turned out to be useless. Last month, Banbury council came under fire for spending £10,000 on a replica of the mayor's ceremonial gold chain. Eight. months ago, Crawley council in Sussex paid £630 to translate its. newsletter into Urdu for the benefit of just one resident who complained. about not understanding the promotional document. And. in 2011, workers at Ashford council were treated to a day out at a. high-wire adventure course, with taxpayers shouldering the £750 bill. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article is about a new office building in Rochdale that cost £50 million to build. The people who work there are upset because the bathrooms are unisex, which means men and women use the same bathrooms. Some workers don't like this, so the gender ratio on each floor of the building will be analyzed before individual toilets are allocated proportionately as either male or female. The building also houses the town's new library and has space for private firms. The council believes this will save £1 million a year and provide a better service to the public."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sentence: \\"Some sentences can go on and on.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"To determine whether a linguist would rate the sentence \\"Some sentences can go on and on\\" as acceptable linguistically, we must consider the various elements of language and grammar. In essence, linguists study the structure, syntax, morphemes, phonemes, and semantics of language. When evaluating a specific sentence, they focus on its structure, order, and usage. Let's assess \\"Some sentences can go on and on\\" based on these considerations: 1) Morphemes: The sentence is comprised of separate morphemes, which are the smallest units of meaning. In this sentence, each word is a morpheme— \\"some,\\" \\"sentences,\\" \\"can,\\" \\"go,\\" \\"on,\\" \\"and,\\" and \\"on.\\" These words combine to create a complete thought and convey the intended meaning. 2) Phonemes: The pronunciation of the sentence follows standard English patterns. There are no unusual or unexpected phoneme combinations, and each individual sound is distinct and recognizable. The phonemic rules are followed accurately, allowing for a natural flow in the language. 3) Syntax: The sentence exhibits a proper syntactic structure. The subject (\\"some sentences\\") is followed by a modal verb (\\"can\\") and an action verb (\\"go on\\"). The prepositional phrase (\\"and on\\") adds emphasis and repetition to the main point. Furthermore, the sentence employs parallel structure by using two repetitions of \\"on\\" with a coordinating conjunction (\\"and\\") linking them. 4) Semantics: The semantics of the sentence is clear and coherent. It effectively conveys the idea that certain sentences tend to be lengthy and verbose. This notion is emphasized through the repetitive use of \\"on\\" and the addition of \\"and.\\" 5) Pragmatics: The sentence can be understood in context as a general observation about sentence structures, and it is easily understood in English. It doesn't require any unique situational or cultural knowledge to grasp its meaning, which contributes to its acceptability. Given these factors, a linguist would likely rate \\"Some sentences can go on and on\\" as an acceptable sentence linguistically. It adheres to the rules of grammar, syntax, phonetics, and semantics, and effectively conveys a message that is easily understood. While it may not be an extraordinarily complex or inventive sentence, it meets the requirements for linguistic acceptability."},{"instruction":"Q:Given this review: \\"Its a v gud app proud to be indian\\" Would you recommend this app to a friend?

Question: You are given a new situation: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change. Pouring the liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid.  and a hint : A catalyst works by providing a lower energy pathway from reactants to products. The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier.  Please answer this question : The reaction in which beaker has a higher activation energy? Answer:","output":"The reaction in beaker T has a higher activation energy. In the given situation, beaker R and beaker T initially contain identical solutions. However, when the chemist pours a different liquid into each beaker, the reaction in beaker R shows no noticeable change, while the reaction in beaker T undergoes a change. This can be explained using the concept of activation energy and the role of a catalyst, as provided in the hint. Activation energy is the minimum energy required by the reactant molecules to form the product or to initiate a chemical reaction. When a catalyst is present in a reaction, it lowers the activation energy by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation complexes. This results in more reactant molecules having enough energy to successfully overcome the energy barrier and convert to products, ultimately increasing the overall reaction rate. Since beaker R shows no noticeable change, it is probable that the solution in beaker R possesses a lower activation energy due to the presence of a catalyst or a more energetically favorable reaction pathway. This means that the reactant molecules can readily transform into products without requiring a large input of energy.  On the other hand, the reaction in beaker T demonstrates a noticeable change, which implies that the activation energy is higher than that of the reaction in beaker R. This suggests that the solution in beaker T does not contain a catalyst or its reactants follow a different reaction pathway that requires more energy for the conversion to products. Consequently, the reaction rate is slower, and a change is observed during the experiment. In summary, the reaction in beaker T has a higher activation energy compared to the reaction in beaker R."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jack had been concentrating on his laptop and, without realizing it, he knocked the smoothie out of Elena's hand. The fruity concoction splattered all over the floor, as well as on a few unfortunate coworkers' shoes. Elena stood there, frozen for a moment, contemplating the disastrous situation. Jack, startled, hastily offered his apologies. \\"Sorry, Elena,\\" he fumbled, \\"I didn't see you coming.\\" Elena sighed, feeling a mixture of emotions—disappointment, frustration, and embarrassment. However, she knew that getting upset wouldn't change the outcome or make Kayla's smoothie magically reappear. She decided to respond with grace and understanding. \\"It's okay, Jack,\\" she reassured him with a weak smile. \\"Accidents happen.\\" Meanwhile, Kayla had noticed the commotion and was now standing nearby, her mouth curved into a sympathetic frown. \\"Why don't we clean this up together?\\" she offered, crumpling a handful of napkins and reaching for the wet floor. Elena, grateful for her friend's support, nodded and joined her. The two friends began wiping up the mess, feeling a sense of camaraderie as they tackled the problem together. As they cleaned, Elena felt a rising urge to make up for the ruined smoothie. She knew how much Kayla had been looking forward to that specific flavor combination—mango, pineapple, and strawberry—that they had both discovered on last week's smoothie run. Elena glanced at her watch and saw that they still had twenty minutes left on their lunch break. \\"What if we try to find another smoothie shop nearby? My treat, of course,\\" Elena suggested. Kayla hesitated for a moment, not wanting to impose on her friend's kindness. However, she realized that Elena needed this restitution as much as she wanted her smoothie. \\"Sure, let's do it,\\" Kayla agreed with a smile. They managed to find a small smoothie café just around the corner from their office building. The place was new, and they had not been there before, but it had a surprisingly vibrant atmosphere and a diverse menu. As luck would have it, they even offered the same flavor combination as the lost smoothie. Elena excitedly ordered two servings, and Kayla thanked her sincerely. While waiting, they struck up a conversation with the barista, who happened to be the owner of the café. He was a friendly man named Rob, and he shared his passion for creating unique, healthy smoothies with the freshest ingredients. Elena and Kayla left the café, each holding their delectable drink in hand, and made their way back to the office. Their previous spirits had been lifted by their shared experience and their newfound smoothie spot. They returned to their desks, feeling closer than ever and energized by the unexpected adventure their day had taken. In the end, the mishap with the spilled smoothie turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It provided Elena and Kayla the opportunity to discover a new establishment, support a local business, and create a memory that they would cherish. From that day on, the two friends made it a point to visit the café often, frequently bringing their other colleagues to introduce them to their favorite flavors. And as for Jack, he surprisingly became a regular customer at the newly discovered café as well. He would frequently pick up an extra smoothie and drop it off at Elena's desk, accompanied by a warm, apologetic smile. Through their shared interest in the smoothie spot, Jack and Elena forged a closer friendship, gradually erasing the clumsy memory of the spilled drink and replacing it with laughs and shared stories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years after being named heir did Alfonso replace Henry on the throne?","output":"Title: The Ascent of Alfonso: Years of Heirship, Intrigue, and a Struggle for the Throne Introduction The reigns of Alfonso and Henry represent an intriguing period in the royal dynastic history of medieval Europe. This article delves into the pivotal question of how many years passed between the time when Alfonso was named heir and the moment when he replaced Henry on the throne. To understand the dynamics at play during this time, we must first take a closer look at the historical context surrounding Alfonso's eventual inheritance of the throne. Historical Background Alfonso VI (c. 1040 - 1109) and his brother, Henry (d. 1066), were sons of Ferdinand I, the King of León and Castile in the 11th century. When Ferdinand I passed away in 1065, a partition of the kingdom among his three sons resulted in the formation of three independent kingdoms—Galicia, León, and Castile. Sancho II, the eldest son, became the King of Castile, while Alfonso emerged as the King of León and Henry received the Kingdom of Galicia. The Naming of Alfonso as Heir to Henry In 1066, Henry died under mysterious circumstances. Some historians have posited that his untimely death might have been the result of poisoning. Regardless of the cause of his demise, Henry bequeathed his kingdom to Alfonso, thereby naming him as his successor. The Years Between Heirship and Ascension The years following Henry's death witnessed a power struggle among the brothers, adding an element of uncertainty to the timeline of Alfonso's eventual ascent to the throne. Sancho II, the eldest brother, felt it was his right to inherit the kingdoms of his younger siblings. As a result, civil wars and confrontations between the kingdoms of León, Galicia, and Castile ensued.  Between 1067 and 1072, the battles between Alfonso and Sancho II persisted. Alfonso managed to maintain control over his kingdom of León, but the contentious sibling rivalry led to the loss of Galicia to Sancho II. Despite this setback, Alfonso was able to recover the kingdom of Galicia in 1071, thereby reestablishing his claim to it. In 1072, a major turning point occurred: Sancho II died during the siege of Zamora. It has been suggested that his gruesome death was due, in part, to the conniving nature of their sister, Urraca. With the death of Sancho II, Alfonso was able to claim not only the Kingdom of Castile but also his brother's hereditary lands. Conclusion From the time that Alfonso was named heir to the Kingdom of Galicia by his brother, Henry, in 1066 until 1072, when he consolidated his power through the acquisition of all the lands previously controlled by Sancho II, a tumultuous six-year period elapsed. During this time, Alfonso and his brothers were embroiled in conflicts and skullduggery that ultimately paved the way for the reunification of the three kingdoms under Alfonso's rule.  Alfonso VI's ascent to the throne, fostered by the convergence of dynastic inheritance, political intrigue, and military strife, serves as a fascinating examination of the complex mechanisms of medieval European power struggles. By understanding the nuances and challenges faced by Alfonso during these critical six years between his naming as heir and his establishment on the throne, we can better appreciate the road he traversed on his way to consolidating power and leaving a lasting legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws where he urged for a constitutional government with three separate branches of government. Each of the three branches would have defined abilities to check the powers of the other branches. This idea was called separation of powers. This philosophy heavily influenced the writing of the United States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power. This United States form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances.  During the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as John Locke advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as Thomas Hobbes, strongly opposed it.

I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera. I didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off. Question: What band's t-shirt is the narrator wearing?

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. find the Music_Festival of music_festival table","output":"Part #1: SELECT statement Usage: SELECT Music_Festival FROM music_festival Explanation: This part of the query selects the \\"Music_Festival\\" column from the \\"music_festival\\" table.

Is Initially, the state did not have an official name and wasn't recognized by neighboring countries for five months. a good answer to this question? Options:  1). yes;  2). no;","output":"2). No; The question asks about the derisive label given to the USSR by the enemies of the Bolsheviks, while the given answer describes the early state of the Soviet Union without an official name and recognition. A more appropriate and detailed answer would be: The derisive label given to the USSR by the enemies of the Bolsheviks was the 'Godless Empire'. The term 'Godless Empire' emerged as an expression of contempt for the Soviet Union, which had a policy of state atheism and actively sought to suppress religious beliefs. The early Soviet government, under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin and later Joseph Stalin, sought to eradicate religious institutions and promote atheism as part of their program for establishing a socialist society based on scientific principles. This goal led to widespread persecution of religious figures and institutions, confiscation of church properties, and a prohibition on religious education. The label 'Godless Empire' was particularly popular among anti-communist groups and nations, notably in the West and among the Russian émigrés who had fled the country after the Bolshevik Revolution. For these critics, the Soviet Union's campaign against religion was a prime example of the totalitarian and oppressive nature of the communist regime. It also served as a way to highlight what they saw as a fundamental contrast between the values of Western liberal democracies, which generally recognized and protected individual freedom of religion, and the Soviet Union, where religious belief was systematically suppressed. This derisive label was not only employed by political opponents, but also inspired numerous artworks, caricatures, and propaganda materials in various countries. The image of the Soviet Union as a 'Godless Empire' continued to be invoked during much of the Cold War era, particularly by conservative politicians and religious figures who opposed communism and sought to emphasize the moral contrast between the two competing blocs. In summary, the derisive label given to the USSR by the enemies of the Bolsheviks was the 'Godless Empire', a term that embodied the widespread criticism of the Soviet Union's policy of state atheism and its efforts to eradicate religious belief and institutions as part of its program to build a socialist society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Randy Randall Rudy Quaid (born October 1, 1950) is an American film and television actor and Academy Award nominee known for his roles in both serious drama and light comedy. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award and an Academy Award for his role in The Last Detail in 1973. In 1978 he co-starred as a prisoner in Midnight Express. Quaid also won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Emmy Award for his portrayal of U.S. President Lyndon Johnson in LBJ: In 2006, Quaid, who acted in Brokeback Mountain, sued the producers for misrepresenting the film as \\"a low-budget, art house film with no prospect of making money\\" in order to secure Quaid's professional acting services at below-market rates.  In 2009, Quaid and his wife were arrested for allegedly defrauding an innkeeper in Santa Barbara by using an invalid credit card to pay a 10,000 bill. The two were released on bail that evening and subsequently paid most of the bill. However, they repeatedly failed to appear in court and warrants were issued for their arrest. They eventually appeared in court the following year where the case was dismissed against Randy Quaid for lack of evidence. His wife, Evi, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of fraud and was placed on probation for three years in addition to having to spend 240 hours in community service.  In September 2010 Quaid and his wife were charged with burglary after they spent five days occupying the guest house in a vacant home they once owned in Santa Barbara. The Quaids claimed that the home was wrongfully transferred to a third party by the use of the forged signature. Warrants for their arrest were issued after they failed to appear in court, and as a result, they also forfeited their bail.  In October 2010, Quaid and his wife moved to Vancouver, Canada, where they were arrested for their outstanding warrants in the U.S. They then sought protection under the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, stating that they feared for their lives in the United States. They were granted bail, after which Quaid gave a press interview. In January 2013, however, Canada denied his request for permanent resident status.  Quaid lived in Montreal since 2013 and was briefly arrested for not checking in as a non-resident. He then crossed the Canadian border into Vermont, but was detained by U.S. Customs. A few days later Quaid was released and allowed to remain in Vermont without conditions, though still subject to arrest should he travel to another state. He and his wife planned to make Vermont their permanent home since his wife grew up there. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: were there other legal issues then?","output":"Yes, apart from the recounted legal issues relating to fraud and burglary, Randy Quaid had also faced other legal issues. Quaid had violated terms of his stay in Canada as a non-resident and was briefly arrested for not checking in, as indicated by the line, \\"Quaid lived in Montreal since 2013 and was briefly arrested for not checking in as a non-resident.\\"  In addition, even after moving to Vermont, he was still subject to legal constraints as he was still under the potential threat of arrest if he were to travel to another state, as stated in the text, \\"A few days later Quaid was released and allowed to remain in Vermont without conditions, though still subject to arrest should he travel to another state.\\" The situations highlight that even beyond the high profile cases of alleged fraud and burglary, Randy Quaid's history includes additional run-ins with legal authorities both in the U.S and Canada. His failed attempt to gain permanent resident status in Canada and his arrest there for not maintaining the required check-ins as a non-resident, mark some major legal issues outside the U.S. In the U.S, even after settling in Vermont, he was under potential risk of arrest indicating ongoing legal issues. Thus, Randy Quaid's legal troubles were not solely confined to the fraud and burglary charges outlined in the previous part of the information, but extended to his life in Canada and subsequent move back to the U.S as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose your answer: Is the following statement correct based on the text is square root of 2 a rational number Possible answers: [i] no; [ii] yes;","output":"[i] no; The statement that the square root of 2 is a rational number is incorrect based on the text provided. It explicitly mentions that the square root of 2 was \\"probably the first number known to be irrational.\\" This means that it cannot be expressed as a fraction (a/b), where a and b are integers (whole numbers) and b is not equal to zero. The irrationality of the square root of 2 is a fundamental concept in mathematics and has been proven through various methods, including geometrical and algebraic proofs. To elaborate on the geometric representation of the square root of 2, let's consider a square with sides of one unit of length. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the diagonal (hypotenuse) of this square can be calculated using the formula: c² = a² + b² In this case, a and b are both equal to 1 (the length of the square's sides), so the formula becomes: c² = 1² + 1² c² = 1 + 1 c² = 2 Therefore, the length of the diagonal (c) is the square root of 2. This further shows that the square root of 2 is a mathematical constant, but not a rational number, as it is derived from the unique properties of a square. To provide some historical context, the concept of irrational numbers was first discovered by the ancient Greek mathematician Hippasus of Metapontum around the 5th century BCE. He showed that the square root of 2 is irrational, which contradicted the widely held belief that all numbers could be expressed as a fraction. This discovery was groundbreaking and led to the deeper understanding of the properties of numbers and the nature of mathematics. In summary, the statement that the square root of 2 is a rational number is incorrect. The square root of 2 is an irrational number, confirmed by its geometric representation and historical context."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

I really needed to get this out. I’m a high schooler, and I have had a best friend Z who I’ve known since 1st grade.  Z is a lovely person most of the time. But they can be really moody and have a tendency to consider themselves on the moral high ground. I really love Z, but this side of them has been extremely frustrating to me for a long time. Z has always been out of romance scene at school, until they got a crush on a dude in the grade level above us (who has a girlfriend in college). Well call him A. We’ve really gotten closer over the last few months through this. Seeing them experience their first crush is honestly heartwarming. I thought this really helped them change their “holier than thou” attitude. I discovered it did not today. I was with Z, and our friend who I’ll call P. P is a nice person who I’ve known for a few years. They’re in the same friend circle as Z and I. So, A, P &amp; Z are involved in theater. We walked with P after school while they went to ask the teacher a question. While walking to the room, the topic of zodiac signs and astrology come up (which I personally love to talk about). P mentioned that they found out A was a Leo (to Z’s excitement). We walked in, and me being a sarcastic jack ass said. Me: hey P, give his birthday, time of birth and location and I’ll know EVERYTHING there is to know about him. P laughs, but Z looked annoyed. Then, Z went on a rant about how I have “privacy issues”. I’m “always digging through their stuff” (I snooped in their bag they brought to a swimming pool once for shits and giggles. We tease each other). They were raising their voice and the two other people in the room were looking. The teacher wasn’t paying attention. P looked very uncomfortable and was laughing awkwardly like ‘wtf..’ Also, side note. I had a really bad childhood and hate, HATE when people yell at me. I have chronic depression and unresolved issues.  She kept ranting for like two minutes, projecting... and I was too shocked to even say anything.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information:  - The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, Mya. The name \\"Carboniferous\\" means \\"coal-bearing\\" and derives from the Latin words \\"carb\\" (\\"coal\\") and \\"fer\\" (\\"I bear, I carry\\"), and was coined by geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips in 1822. Based on a study of the British rock succession, it was the first of the modern 'system' names to be employed, and reflects the fact that many coal beds were formed globally during that time. The Carboniferous is often treated in North America as two geological periods, the earlier Mississippian and the later Pennsylvanian.  - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Xyrospondylus is an extinct genus of non-mammalian synapsid .  - Therapsida is a group of synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors. Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids, including having their four limbs extend vertically beneath the body, as opposed to the sprawling posture of other reptiles. The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida is \\"Tetraceratops insignis\\" from the Lower Permian.   - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - The pelycosaurs (from Greek  \\"pelyx\\" \\"bowl\\" or \\"axe\\" and  \\"sauros\\" \\"lizard\\") are an informal grouping (previously considered an order) composed of basal or primitive Late Paleozoic synapsids, sometimes erroneously referred to as \\"mammal-like reptiles\\". They consist of all synapsids except for the therapsids and their descendants. Some species were quite large and could grow up to or more, although most species were much smaller. Because more advanced groups of synapsids evolved directly from 'pelycosaurs', the term had fallen out of favor among scientists by the 21st century, and is only used informally, if at all, in the modern scientific literature.    What entity does 'xyrospondylus' has the relation 'parent taxon' with? A:","output":"The entity 'Xyrospondylus' has the relation 'parent taxon' with the group Synapsids, specifically with non-mammalian synapsids. Synapsids include mammals and their ancestors and are one of the two major groups of amniotes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977.  - The ZX81 is a home computer produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful, and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where it was initially sold as the ZX-81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales.

This releases a huge amount of energy.   Q: Splitting the nucleus of an atom produces a massive amount of what type of energy?   Choices:  - likely energy  - radioactive energy  - sure energy  - nuclear energy  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"- nuclear energy Splitting the nucleus of an atom produces a massive amount of nuclear energy. This process, also known as nuclear fission, involves breaking apart the nucleus of an atom, which releases a large quantity of energy in the form of heat and electromagnetic radiation. This energy can be harnessed and converted into electricity, making nuclear power a valuable resource for generating electricity on a large scale. The basis of nuclear power generation lies in the strong binding forces within the atomic nucleus. When the nucleus is split, these binding forces are released, and the energy produced is a result of the conversion of these forces into other forms of energy. This released energy is primarily in the form of heat, which can be used to boil water to generate steam. The steam is then used to drive a turbine, which helps generate electricity. The other three energy types mentioned - likely energy, radioactive energy, and sure energy - are not actual forms of energy. The term 'radioactive energy' might seem related to nuclear energy because radioactive materials are involved in the process, but the energy being released during fission is indeed nuclear energy. The terms 'likely energy' and 'sure energy' do not have any scientific basis and are not used in the context of energy generation or nuclear physics. In summary, splitting the nucleus of an atom produces a massive amount of nuclear energy, which can be harnessed for various applications, including power generation on a large scale. This form of energy is obtained through the process of nuclear fission, which involves breaking apart the strongly bound atomic nucleus and releasing the binding forces as heat and electromagnetic radiation, which can ultimately be converted into electricity."},{"instruction":"Question: Article: Boys and girls, let's begin our English class now.

Despite his best efforts, he struggled to find a job and get his life back on track. His mother, a warm and loving woman with a slight penchant for eccentricity, never judged Tommy for his chosen profession or his tumble on hard times. One day, Tommy's life took an unexpected turn. His mother announced that she and Jed, her long-time boyfriend, were going to Las Vegas to tie the knot.

Though they had never had a deep connection in the past, Tommy and Mr. Franklin soon found solace in each other's company. They discussed their lives since high school, reminiscing about the good old days and lamenting the changes the world had undergone. However, just when Tommy got used to this new living arrangement, he found out about Mr. Franklin's peculiar nighttime ritual. Every night, without fail, Mr. Franklin would blast motivational tapes through a portable speaker at full volume. He wholeheartedly believed in the power of these tapes to improve one's life and had invested in an impressive collection over the years. The grating voice of the energetic speaker flooded the room, urging its occupants to seize the day, be proactive, and push beyond their limits. At first, Tommy found it almost laughable, but as sleepless nights piled up, it started to wear on him. He knew he couldn't confront Mr. Franklin; the old man would take it as a personal offense. Instead, Tommy decided to make the most of the situation. He started to listen to the tapes, to try and understand the appeal. To his chagrin, Tommy soon realized that some of the messages resonated with him, and he began to feel more motivated than he had in years. He decided it was time to make some changes, to dust off the cobwebs and take control of his destiny. The following weeks passed in a flurry of activity, as Tommy started to search for jobs with a new sense of purpose. He even took up a few online courses to broaden his horizons. It astonished him how much more he could achieve now that he felt inspired and focused. When his mother and Jed returned from their Las Vegas honeymoon, they were overjoyed to see how their son had transformed in their absence. Tommy's newfound motivation had paved the path to self-improvement, and he had Mr. Franklin and his noisy motivational tapes to thank for that. The experience with the Woodalls and his former high school principal turned out to be a much-needed catalyst for change in Tommy's life. For the first time in years, Tommy looked forward to the future with a sense of hope and excitement, embracing opportunities he never knew existed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a game that was hyped as a potential Super Bowl preview, the Patriots rolled into Lambeau Field to face Aaron Rodgers and the red hot 8-3 Packers who were 6-0 at home, in a game that lived up to the hype. This was the first matchup between Rodgers and Brady, as Rodgers missed the 2010 contest at Gillette Stadium with a concussion. On the opening drive of the game, the Packers drove all the way to the Patriots 14, but the Patriots red zone defense continued to stay hot and forced them to settle for a 32-yard field goal by Mason Crosby. After a Patriots punt, the Packers, aided by a 33-yard completion from Rodgers to Davante Adams, reached the Patriots 17, but once again the Patriots defense kept them out of the end zone and Mason Crosby kicked a 35-yard field goal, increasing the Packers lead to 6-0. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Packers stormed 85 yards in only 4 plays with Rodgers finding Richard Rodgers deep for a 45-yard touchdown pass, increasing the lead to 13-0. After a terrible first quarter, the Patriots got things going on their next drive. On the first play of the second quarter, Tom Brady darted a pass to Gronkowski for a 29-yard gain to the Packers 41. Three plays later Brandon Bolden scampered for a 6-yard touchdown, trimming the deficit to 13-7. The Patriots defense responded by getting the Packers to a 3rd-and-5, but no pass rush allowed Rodgers 14 seconds to find Randall Cobb for a 33-yard gain to the Patriots 34. The Packers reached the Patriots 6, but Hightower sacked Rodgers for a 9-yard loss on 3rd-and-goal, and Crosby kicked a 33-yard field goal with just under six minutes remaining in the first half. Down 16-7, Brady drove the Patriots back down the field again on an 80-yard drive, finding LaFell in the back of the end zone for a 2-yard touchdown pass, trimming the score to 16-14. However, 1:05 would prove to be too much time for Aaron Rodgers. After an incompletion to Adams, Rodgers threw a screen pass to James Starks who took it 28 yards to the Packers 47. An 8-yard completion to Jordy Nelson moved the ball to the Patriots 45. Two plays later, Rodgers hit Nelson in stride, who outran Revis and McCourty, for a 45-yard touchdown with 00:14 remaining in the first half, increasing the lead to 23-14. That was only the 2nd touchdown Revis allowed all season. The third quarter was a stalemate, as both defenses began to take over and neither team scored. The Patriots took over with 2:21 remaining in the third and constructed a 9 play, 78-yard drive with Brady throwing a laser to LaFell for a 15-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, pulling the Patriots within two, 23-21. The Packers countered, reaching the Patriots 10, but Adams dropped a sure touchdown on a wide-open slant on 3rd-and-5, but Crosby kicked a 28-yard field goal, making the score 26-21 with 8:41 remaining. On their next drive, Brady converted a 4th-and-3 to Edelman at their own 49, and two plays later converted a 3rd-and-7 with a 10-yard pass to Gronkowski. Three plays later, Brady dropped a pass into the arms of Rob Gronkowski who caught the ball momentarily, but Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix punched it out before it could be ruled a catch, wiping out a touchdown. On the very next play, Mike Daniels and Mike Neal combined to sack Brady for a 9-yard loss. Instead of calling a timeout Gostkowski was sent out on the field for a 47-yard field goal attempt with the clock running to preserve a timeout at the two-minute warning, but Gostkowski missed the hurried field goal attempt, keeping the score 26-21 with just 2:40 remaining. The Patriots forced a 3rd-and-4, but Rodgers converted it with a 7-yard pass to Cobb, enabling the Packers to run out the clock and win the game. The Patriots fell to 9-3 with the loss, snapping their 7-game winning streak. The Patriots looked nothing like the team that had won 7 straight games, struggling in all facets of the game. Tom Brady was 22 of 35 for 245 yards 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. The Patriots managed 84 yards rushing, but only carried the ball 19 times.  Rob Gronkowski was the receiving star for the Patriots with 7 catches for 98 yards.  Aaron Rodgers, continuing his home dominance, turned in another great performance, completing 24 of 38 passes for 368 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, benefiting from the Patriots almost non-existent pass rush. They managed three sacks, but couldn't get any consistent pressure. Meanwhile, Eddie Lacy had 98 yards on 21 carries.

However,he adds,our ability to concentrate typically starts to decrease soon thereafter.Most of us are more easily distracted between noon and 4 pm. Alertness also tends to fall after eating a meal and sleepiness tends to peak around 2 pm,making that a good time for a nap.

Language isolates are in effect language families consisting of a single language. Commonly cited examples include Ainu, Basque, Korean and Sumerian, though in each case a minority of linguists claim to have demonstrated a relationship with other languages.  - Sumerian (\\"native tongue\\") is the language of ancient Sumer and a language isolate which was spoken in southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a substantial scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a \\"Sprachbund\\" (area of linguistic convergence).  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.  - Sumer was the first urban civilization in the historical region of southern Mesopotamia, modern-day southern Iraq, during the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze ages, and arguably the first civilization in the world with Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley. Living along the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, Sumerian farmers were able to grow an abundance of grain and other crops, the surplus of which enabled them to settle in one place.  - Sumerian literature is the literature written in the Sumerian language during the Middle Bronze Age . Most Sumerian literature is preserved indirectly , via Assyrian or Babylonian copies . The Sumerians invented the first writing system , developing Sumerian cuneiform writing out of earlier proto - writing systems by about the 30th century BC. The earliest literary texts appear from about the 27th century BC. The Sumerian language remained in official and literary use in the Akkadian and Babylonian empires , even after the spoken language disappeared from the population ; literacy was widespread , and the Sumerian texts that students copied heavily influenced later Babylonian literature .  - Mesopotamia (\\"[land] between rivers\\"; from Ancient Armenian  (Mijagetq); \\"bild ar-rfidayn\\" \\"miyn rodn\\"; \\"Beth Nahrain\\" \\"land of rivers\\") is a name for the area of the TigrisEuphrates river system, in modern days roughly corresponding to most of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, Southeastern Turkey, and regions along the Turkish-Syrian and IranIraq borders.  - Babylonia was an ancient Akkadian-speaking state and cultural area based in central-southern Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). A small Amorite-ruled state emerged in 1894 BC, which contained at this time the minor city of Babylon. Babylon greatly expanded during the reign of Hammurabi in the first half of the 18th century BC, becoming a major capital city. During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards, Babylonia was called \\"Mt Akkad\\" \\"the country of Akkad\\" in the Akkadian language. It was often involved in rivalry with its older fellow Akkadian-speaking state of Assyria in northern Mesopotamia. Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi (fl. c. 1792  1752 BC middle chronology, or c. 1696  1654 BC, short chronology) created a short-lived empire, succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire, Third Dynasty of Ur, and Old Assyrian Empire; however, the Babylonian empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi.  - A sprachbund (\\"federation of languages\\")  also known as a linguistic area, area of linguistic convergence, diffusion area or language crossroads  is a group of languages that have common features resulting from geographical proximity and language contact.

Q: What is caused by bodies sliding over rough surfaces?   Choices:  - heat loss  - tension  - vibration  - friction  A: A:","output":"The phenomenon caused by bodies sliding over rough surfaces, as mentioned in the given paragraph, is friction. Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact. When objects slide against each other, the irregularities on their surfaces interact, leading to the generation of the friction force. Let's briefly discuss the other choices for a better understanding: 1. Heat Loss: Although not the direct cause, heat loss can be a byproduct of friction. When two objects slide against each other, part of the energy used to create motion is converted into heat. This heat is dissipated into the surroundings, resulting in energy loss. However, this is an indirect effect of friction and not the direct cause of bodies sliding over rough surfaces. 2. Tension: Tension is generally related to forces being applied to string-like objects, such as ropes or wires. It is the force experienced within the material that opposes being stretched apart. Tension is not directly caused by bodies sliding over rough surfaces but can be involved when a load is being moved across a surface by a pulling action. 3. Vibration: Vibration refers to oscillatory motion or the periodic back-and-forth movement of an object or a particle. While vibration may be observed or induced due to rough surfaces coming in contact or sliding, it is not the primary force at play when bodies slide over rough surfaces. To conclude, friction is the force caused by bodies sliding over rough surfaces. Other choices, like heat loss, tension, and vibration, may be associated or observed in certain situations, but they do not directly result from bodies sliding over rough surfaces."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task you are given a statement and an explanation giving you further knowledge about an entity in the statement.

Additionally, I will explore the meanings of the words \\"possibly,\\" \\"maybe,\\" and \\"merely,\\" which are crucial to understanding the similarity or difference between the two statements. First, let's examine the statement \\"Or perhaps it's merely a matter of quality.\\" In this sentence, \\"perhaps\\" serves as an adverb suggesting an element of doubt or uncertainty. It implies that the speaker isn't entirely sure whether \\"quality\\" is the key factor, but it is one potential explanation. The word \\"merely\\" implies a reduction in significance or importance. By using \\"merely,\\" the speaker may be expressing that the issue at hand might not be as substantial as it initially seemed. The primary focus in this sentence, however, is on the word \\"quality.\\" The speaker is suggesting that \\"quality\\" could be the reason behind whatever subject they are discussing. Moving on to the statement \\"Or maybe it is a matter of quality.\\" Here, \\"maybe\\" serves a similar purpose to \\"perhaps,\\" as both serve as adverbs indicating a degree of uncertainty or doubt. The word \\"maybe\\" implies that quality might be a crucial factor in the situation, but there may also be other considerations. The main point in this sentence is also \\"quality.\\" Now let's discuss the similarities and differences between the two statements. Both sentences present the idea that \\"quality\\" could potentially be a key factor in the situation. \\"Perhaps\\" and \\"maybe\\" both imply doubt or uncertainty, suggesting that the speaker isn't entirely convinced. However, the first statement, \\"Or perhaps it's merely a matter of quality,\\" includes the word \\"merely,\\" which can reduce the significance or importance of the matter. Although this difference is subtle, it could indicate a slight variation in how the speaker perceives the role of \\"quality\\" in the situation. Considering the analysis provided above, I would pick option 1: yes, both statements convey a similar meaning.

When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles.  The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy.  Now, I have a new situation: Rob is competing in a cross country race. After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand. But sign B says that it's not a quicksand. He has to decide which way to go.  Answer this question please: Would sing A indicate spongy texture or not spongy texture of the soil? The answer is:","output":"Sign A would indicate a spongy texture of the soil, as it says that it's a quicksand."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The Shinkansen, a network of high-speed railway lines in Japan is also known as the ‘what’ Train?","output":"The Shinkansen, a network of high-speed railway lines in Japan, is also commonly known as the \\"Bullet Train.\\" This nickname is derived from the train's distinct aerodynamic design, which is meant to resemble the shape of a bullet. The purpose of this unique design is to minimize air resistance and improve overall speed and efficiency. The Shinkansen first started operating in 1964, and since then, it has become an essential mode of transportation within Japan. It is considered among the fastest and most efficient high-speed rail systems in the world, with top speeds reaching up to 320 kilometers per hour (198 miles per hour). The bullet train connects numerous cities throughout Japan, from the southern island of Kyushu to the northern island of Hokkaido, making it easier for people to travel long distances in a relatively short amount of time. The development of the Shinkansen was incredibly significant not just for Japan's transportation system but also for the global railway industry. By using an innovative approach to engineering, the Japanese bullet train has become a model for high-speed rail systems in other parts of the world. Countries like France, Germany, and China have all since developed their own high-speed rail networks based on the success of the Shinkansen. Some of the key features that make the Shinkansen stand out among other high-speed rail systems include its impeccable safety record, punctuality, and efficiency. Since its inception, there have been zero fatal collisions or derailments, despite the fact that Japan is prone to natural disasters like earthquakes and typhoons. The Shinkansen has also managed to maintain an average annual delay of less than one minute, which is truly remarkable considering its widespread usage. Apart from transportation, the Shinkansen has also contributed to the economic growth of Japan by connecting major economic centers and boosting tourism. Traveling on a bullet train is not only fast but also offers a comfortable and enjoyable experience. The interiors of the trains are spacious and well-designed, with a variety of seating options and amenities to cater to passengers' needs. The train cars are designed with a low noise level in mind, reducing noise pollution both inside and outside of the train. Additionally, the trains' large windows provide passengers with scenic views of Japan's beautiful landscape as they travel at high speeds. In conclusion, the Shinkansen, or Japan's \\"Bullet Train,\\" is a revolutionary high-speed railway network that has played a significant role in transforming the country's transportation infrastructure and boosting its economy. Known for its speed, safety, punctuality, and efficiency, the Shinkansen has become a symbol of pride for the nation and a model for other countries looking to develop their own high-speed rail systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: A Bay State solar panel developer that landed a state loan from Mitt Romney when he was Massachusetts governor has gone belly up — a day after the GOP presidential hopeful ripped President Obama’s green-energy investments.      Lowell-based Konarka Technologies announced late yesterday that it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and will cease operations, lay off its 85 workers and liquidate. ||||| WASHINGTON It would be a triumphant moment for any governor: A cutting-edge company announces plans to build a new plant that will create hundreds of high-paying jobs and bolster one of the state's most prominent industries.      For Mitt Romney, the June 2006 announcement by drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb served as a signature accomplishment as his four-year stint as Massachusetts governor drew to a close and a U.S. presidential bid beckoned.      The new facility came with a price tag: Romney and other state officials agreed to 67 million in tax breaks and other inducements to ensure the New York-based company picked Massachusetts over rival states like North Carolina.      Now as he mounts his second White House bid, Romney is hammering President Barack Obama for playing favorites with green-tech companies rather than letting businesses succeed or fail on their own. Romney is the presumptive Republican challenger to face Obama, a Democrat, in the November 6 election.      \\"Obama is giving taxpayer money to big donors and then watching them lose it,\\" Romney's campaign said in an Internet video released on Tuesday.      It's a powerful line of attack that connects failed ventures like Solyndra, the bankrupt California-based solar panel maker that defaulted on a 535 million loan from the U.S. Energy Department, with the trillion-dollar budget deficits and sluggish U.S. economy of the past four years.      But it might invite unfavorable comparison with Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. During that time, Romney pursued a hands-on approach to economic development that favored some industries over others and, in some instances, singled out individual firms for special favors.      Romney, a former private equity executive, backed tax breaks for film makers and biotech and medical-device manufacturers. His administration promoted venture capital-style funds that extended loans to start-up companies, some of which subsequently went out of business.      As the state's top salesman, he led the effort to lure desirable employers through tax breaks and other incentives.      \\"That's what governors do - they have to pick winners and losers,\\" said Boston University professor Fred Bayles. \\"It's a calculated risk that governors and state politicians take in an effort to get jobs.\\"      Sometimes, as with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Romney's efforts panned out. Other times they did not.      A 2.5 million state loan helped lure Rhode Island biotech firm Spherics Inc across the state line to Massachusetts in 2005. Romney's economic development secretary, Ranch Kimball, touted the move as \\"a tangible result of the combined and coordinated efforts of the public and private sectors to highlight the benefits of locating in Massachusetts.\\"      The company shut down three years later, laying off all of its employees and defaulting on 1.5 million of the loan, according to MassDevelopment, the state development authority.      Critics on the left say Romney would have been better off investing in education and transportation to boost the state's business climate over the long term. Critics on the right say he should have concentrated on lowering business taxes overall, rather than aiding selected industries or companies.      'MAKES NO SENSE'      \\"It makes no sense to give tax breaks to some companies and not others when the solution lies in making the tax code m ore investment friendly,\\" said David Tuerck, who heads the Beacon Hill Institute, a conservative Massachusetts think tank.      American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic research group, noted that while Romney the candidate opposes government intervention in business, many of the companies he owned during his time as head of private equity firm Bain Capital took advantage of government subsidies.      \\"In many ways Romney's whole approach to the economy is hypocritical,\\" said American Bridge president Rodell Mollineau.      Romney's defenders say he was just doing his job as governor. Though a hub of innovation and research, Massachusetts has a high cost of living and a reputation for being hostile to business that often put it at a disadvantage compared with other states.      In such an environment, incentives are sometimes needed to lure marquee employers, but they were never the primary emphasis of Romney's salesmanship, Romney backers say.      \\"States are different from the federal government in that we are absolutely competing for businesses with other states,\\" said Jim Stergios, who worked to streamline regulations as a member of Romney's administration. \\"Do you go back to Bristol-Myers Squibb and say, 'I know North Carolina is offering you 70 million and we're not going to offer you anything?' You've got to be in the game.\\"      Campaigning for governor in 2002, Romney said he would not rely on special breaks or other \\"corporate welfare\\" to stem an exodus of manufacturing jobs.      \\"There are some companies that are only interested in tax breaks. Let them go to Alabama,\\" Romney said at a news conference in October 2002.      Less than three weeks after taking office in 2003, Romney announced a new 15 million green-energy fund to help renewable-energy businesses in the state. A solar-panel company, two fuel-cell firms, a methane-gas facility and another firm got a total of 9 million in state funds in help.      'MAJOR ECONOMIC SPRINGBOARD'      In remarks at Konarka, a Lowell solar-panel firm that got a 1.5 million state loan, Romney said he hoped the green-energy fund \\"can become a major economic springboard in the renewable energy sector,\\" according to a news release at the time.      Romney also signed off on a 12.5 million Emergency Technology fund for the state to help high-risk technology startups. The program since then has aided companies like E Ink, which developed the technology used in Amazon.com's Kindle e-reader, but has also lost money on some of its investments.      Along with Spherics, the program lost an undisclosed amount of money on a 2 million loan to biotech firm Acusphere, according to MassDevelopment.      Romney campaign officials say it is inaccurate to compare either fund with the Obama administration's loan program that backed Solyndra and other green-tech companies. Republicans have criticized Obama's program as a costly boondoggle that rewarded politically connected businesses and interfered with market forces.      Romney campaign officials point out that both funds were overseen by independent agencies, not political appointees. Romney used existing money from an underused trust to set up the green-energy fund, and he vetoed the venture-capital portion of the technology fund before it was restored by the Democratic-controlled state legislature.      \\"Governor Romney is proud of the record he had of making Massachusetts a pro-business environment that added jobs,\\" said a Romney campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity.      Romney also centered a 2003 economic-development bill around tax credits for biotech and medical-device manufacturers that create jobs. It is hard to tell if they had an impact.      Employment in the biotech sector rose 25 percent from 2002 to 2006, according to the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, a trade group. But federal statistics indicate that the state lost 4 percent of its pharmaceutical-manufacturing jobs and 20 percent of its medical-equipment manufacturing jobs during that period.      Overall, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation under Romney's tenure.      Romney's economic-development efforts did not move the needle much one way or the other, said Leigh McIlvaine, an analyst with Good Jobs First, a left-leaning research group that tracks economic-development subsidies.      \\"He was betting just as blindly as anyone else was during that time,\\" McIlvaine said.      Romney backed a much bigger tax break for the movie industry in November 2005, signing a bill that would give tax credits of up to 7 million for productions that film in the state.      Subsidies like these have been criticized as inefficient, while backers say they are needed to support a home-grown film industry and can boost tourism.      The program had generated about 1,700 in-state jobs through 2010, costing the state 142,500 in lost tax revenue for each job, according to the Massachusetts tax office. The state had gotten back 13 cents for every dollar it gave up in tax revenue.      In the case of Bristol Myers-Squibb, backers can point to tangible results. The 750 million facility, completed in 2011, now employs 350 people. It employed 1,000 contractors at the height of construction, according to the company.      The state issued 34 million in bonds to build new sewage facilities at the site, a former Army base, and agreed to modify an existing tax credit so the company could get back 33 million from the state. Labor leaders agreed to build the facility at reduced rates. The town where the plant was built agreed to allow it to be taller than local limits would have permitted.      Robert Lynch, an economics professor at Washington College in Maryland, said that broadly speaking these types of incentives have not been shown to make a difference.      \\"They probably could have spent the money more effectively in other ways,\\" Lynch said.

Which reaction has a lower temperature?  Alexander is conducting reactions in his college chemistry class. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses a large amount of reactants. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses a much smaller amount of reactants compared to reaction A. As the reactions are proceeding, he measures that reactants in reaction A have low average kinetic energy. At the same time, reactants in reaction B have high average kinetic energy.  Hint: The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup. To compare the thermal energy of some other materials, go to the following URL and click on the interactive animation “Temperature and Thermal Energy.” A:","output":"The question is asking for the reaction with the lower temperature based on a comparison of the reactions A and B and the hint provided. The hint suggests that larger quantities of a substance can have greater total kinetic energy but less average kinetic energy, resulting in greater thermal energy overall. By comparison, smaller amounts of a substance can have less total kinetic energy but greater average kinetic energy, potentially resulting in higher temperature. This is because temperature can be loosely thought of as a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. The average kinetic energy is concerned with how fast the particles are moving on average, not how many there are. Temperature isn't affected by the number of particles; a small bucket of water boiling at 100 degrees Celsius has the same temperature as a large pot of boiling water. In the text given, reaction A has a large amount of reactants with low average kinetic energy, while reaction B has a smaller amount of reactants but with high average kinetic energy. In the context of the hint provided, we can liken reaction A to the water in the tub and reaction B to the soup in the pot. In both cases, even though there is more of the substance in reaction A and the tub, the lower average kinetic energy could mean a lower temperature. On the other hand, even though there is less of the substance in reaction B and the pot of soup, the higher average kinetic energy could correspond to a higher temperature. So, the reaction that has a lower temperature, based on the information provided and the hint given, is reaction A. This is because while reaction A does have a greater mass of reactants leading to greater total kinetic energy due to the greater number of particles, the average kinetic energy per particle is lower. Considering temperature is a reflection of the average kinetic energy, and not the total kinetic energy or the total number of particles, reaction A therefore likely exhibits a lower temperature than reaction B. Remember that these are general principles, and actual reactions are guided by their specific characteristics and conditions such as nature of reactants, pressure, and presence of catalysts among other factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Triple: Giraffe eatType pub; Giraffe food Fast food; Giraffe area riverside; Giraffe familyFriendly yes What is a sentence that describes this triple?","output":"The given triple provides several interesting facts about giraffes and their behavior and environmental preferences. The term \\"Giraffe eatType pub\\" denotes that this particular giraffe can be found eating in a pub, suggesting that its food consumption habits may involve human interaction or possibly a controlled environment that is not typical for this species. However, one should clarify that giraffes usually have a diet comprising of leaves, shoots, and fruits in their natural habitat, certainly not pub food. This information might be specific to a particular setting, perhaps a zoo or a wildlife conservation area that utilizes pub-like settings for feedings or interaction. The next part, \\"Giraffe food Fast food,\\" is equally intriguing, implying that this giraffe eats fast food. This is far from the regular diet of a giraffe in the wild and could be harmful if applied in a real context. Giraffes are herbivores, meaning that their usual diet consists mostly of leaves, particularly from acacia trees, twigs, fruits, and flowers. Fast food, on the other hand, is a man-made convenience food type, often high in fat, sugar, and carbohydrates, usually not suitable for animal consumption, and certainly not for giraffes. Again, this information could refer to a specific and controlled situation, but it's crucial to note that this type of diet, if given consistently, might have adverse effects on the giraffe's health and lifespan. \\"Giraffe area riverside\\" indicates that this giraffe is usually found in a riverside area. Giraffes, natively, inhabit the grasslands, savannas, and woodlands in Africa, particularly the Sahel regions. The presence of giraffes near riversides can be attributed to the availability of lush vegetation near these bodies of water, providing ample feeding opportunities. However, it's also possible that this information might be referring to a specific giraffe residing in a zoo, wildlife park, or conservation area located near a riverside. Lastly, \\"Giraffe familyFriendly Yes\\" suggests that this giraffe is friendly around families or is safe to be around humans, including children. Though giraffes are usually calm creatures and are unlikely to attack humans unprovoked, in a wild setting, closer interactions are generally not recommended for safety reasons. But in controlled environments such as zoos and wildlife parks, some giraffes are acclimated to human presence and might even be part of programs allowing visitors, including families with children, to feed them under monitored conditions.  In a nutshell, the triple appears to describe a giraffe found in a controlled environment, such as a zoo or wildlife conservation park, that can be spotted feeding in a pub-like setting, unusually consumes fast food, lives near a riverside, and is deemed family friendly or safe for human interaction. It's worth noting that except for the family-friendly part, the other conditions, particularly the eating habits, are atypical for giraffes and not representative of the species as found in the wild."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person Messay Kebede argued had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba?  Ethiopian historians such as Taddesse Tamrat (1935–2013) and Sergew Hable Sellassie have argued that modern Ethiopian studies were an invention of the 17th century and originated in Europe. Tamrat considered Carlo Conti Rossini's 1928 Storia d'Etiopia a groundbreaking work in Ethiopian studies. The philosopher Messay Kebede likewise acknowledged the genuine contributions of Western scholars to the understanding of Ethiopia's past. But he also criticized the perceived scientific and institutional bias that he found to be pervasive in Ethiopian-, African-, and Western-made historiographies on Ethiopia. Specifically, Kebede took umbrage at E. A. Wallis Budge's translation of the Kebra Nagast, arguing that Budge had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba although the Kebra Nagast itself did not indicate such a provenience for this fabled ruler. According to Kebede, a South Arabian extraction was contradicted by biblical exegetes and testimonies from ancient historians, which instead indicated that the Queen was of African origin. Additionally, he chided Budge and Ullendorff for their postulation that the Aksumite civilization was founded by Semitic immigrants from South Arabia. Kebede argued that there is little physical difference between the Semitic-speaking populations in Ethiopia and neighboring Cushitic-speaking groups to validate the notion that the former groups were essentially descendants of South Arabian settlers, with a separate ancestral origin from other local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. He also observed that these Afroasiatic-speaking populations were heterogeneous, having interbred with each other and also assimilated alien elements of both uncertain extraction and negroid origin.

By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

Try to keep your memoir to a narrow focus on one time period or aspect in your life, ultimately drilling home a larger message. If written well, this one topic or time you went through will become universal and all audiences will be able to relate. Start thinking of writable material.  What's something you can't deny? What or who did you leave behind? What's something you did that you no longer understand? What are you sorry you never did? What physical characteristic are you proud to pass on? When did you unexpectedly feel compassion? What do you have too much of? When did you know you were in trouble? They will bring to mind the experiences you could write about.  If possible, go to the scene and relive the events in your mind. Just because you can't remember it off-hand doesn't mean you shouldn't write about it. Memoirs are all about self-exploration and there's more to you than just you, after all. You are the places you go, the people you love, and the things you have, too. This is one moment when your mind should be playing second fiddle to your heart. And if the emotions are scary, nonsensical, painful, or downright terrifying, all the better. Bringing these to the surface will help you stay in the moment and write with passion, purpose, and clarity.  If a train of thought gets close to a nerve, don't close the doors and draw the curtains. If you stop, your writing will go flat and you'll end up dancing around subjects. Take your mind to a place it may not want to go. Hiding behind those first thoughts may be something worth knowing, worth writing about. Listen to music that can metaphorically take you back in time or noticeably changes your mood. Anything that stirs your emotions and allows your mind to be absorbed back into that moment can shed light on the past. This not only gives you one or two hours a week to get mindfully organized, but it allows your writing to be organic and creative and not the therapy itself. A memoir is not to find closure, it's to be shared with others, to expose a bit of yourself. It's totally normal to feel like you're going crazy. Digging around your old emotions will surely bring them to life and make them feel real. All you have to do, then, is write them down on paper and soak in the catharsis. You may even find that the story is writing itself and the conclusion you never even saw coming is looming right in front of you.","output":"A good memoir is not simply a recount of one's entire life; rather, it is a focused glimpse into a specific time or aspect that was profound and meaningful to the individual. By narrowing the scope of the memoir, the writer can convey a more significant message, allowing readers to resonate with the content on a universal level. To begin crafting a memoir, consider various thought-provoking questions, such as regrets, impactful moments, relationships, or personal attributes. This will help spark memories and experiences that are worth sharing. It is essential to immerse oneself in the emotions attached to those memories. Visiting the places where these events occurred or recalling the surrounding environment can help to reawaken the feelings experienced at that time. Don't shy away from confronting difficult emotions, as doing so will only hinder the authenticity of your writing. Embracing these intense sensations and allowing them to guide your words can lead to a powerful and compelling narrative. Using external stimuli such as music to evoke specific moods or transport oneself back to the past can also shed light on the story you're trying to tell. However, it's important to find a balance between self-exploration and maintaining a regular writing routine, ensuring that the memoir's primary purpose remains sharing a piece of oneself with readers, rather than serving as a form of therapy. Delving into old emotions can be a challenging and overwhelming experience, but embracing the emotional journey is vital to the memoir-writing process. By putting these emotions on paper, an individual can experience catharsis and will likely notice the story taking shape, potentially resulting in an unforeseen, yet satisfying, conclusion. In essence, an effective memoir captures the essence of a pivotal moment or aspect in a person's life and shares it with readers, evoking relatable emotions and creating a universally relevant narrative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilard, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. A secret German facility, apparently the largest of the Third Reich, covering 75 acres in an underground complex, was being re-excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development. The letter is believed to be \\"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first.

Write an article based on this summary: An influx of wolves preying on reindeer herds has triggered a state of emergency in the Sakha Republic, in north-eastern Russia. Article:","output":"Title: State of Emergency in Sakha Republic: The Alarming Impact of Wolves on Reindeer Herds in North-Eastern Russia Introduction: The Sakha Republic, situated in north-eastern Russia, is facing an unprecedented state of emergency following a massive influx of wolves preying on the region's reindeer herds. This phenomenon has resulted in devastating consequences for the local communities who rely heavily on the rearing of these reindeer for their survival and economic well-being. The ecological and socio-economic implications are far-reaching, with the government and experts calling for immediate intervention to alleviate the escalating situation. The Case of the Vanishing Reindeer: Reindeer herds have been an integral part of the Sakha Republic's cultural, economic, and ecological landscape for centuries. They serve as the primary source of livelihood for the local communities, who depend on them not only for food and clothing but also for transport and income generation. The recent explosion in the wolf population has led to the sharp decline in reindeer numbers, putting the region's sustainability in jeopardy. Multiple factors are contributing to this ecological crisis, including the loss of habitat, changing weather patterns, and increasing human activities. However, the primary reason for the decline in the reindeer population is the predatory behavior of the rapidly growing wolf population in the Sakha Republic. The Wolf Dilemma: The wolf population in the Sakha Republic has increased significantly over recent years, posing a significant threat to the reindeer herds. The increase in wolf numbers is attributed to various factors such as the abundance of food caused by climate change – leading to higher birth rates, a decrease in the human population – resulting in fewer human-wolf conflicts, and a reduction in hunting activities targeting wolves due to enhanced legislation. The wolves in the Sakha Republic have quickly learned to prey upon the reindeer herds, causing a catastrophic impact on the local communities. This has led to a drastic decrease in the number of reindeer available, which consequently jeopardizes the livelihoods of the indigenous people. Economic and Socio-Cultural Implications: A reduction in the reindeer population not only threatens the ecosystem but also has significant economic and socio-cultural implications. Reindeer herding has been a vital component of the indigenous communities' identity, cultural practices, and economic stability. The dwindling reindeer herds could lead to the extinction of traditional practices and values associated with reindeer herding in the Sakha Republic. As the survival of these communities and their way of life is contingent upon the availability of stable resources, the decline in reindeer populations also leads to reduced income generation, increased poverty levels, and could potentially force the indigenous communities to abandon their traditional lifestyle in search of alternative sources of income. Government and Expert Response: The alarming decline in the reindeer population has called for urgent intervention from the government and environmental experts. Several measures are being proposed to address the issue, focusing on mitigating the impact of the wolves on the reindeer population. These include the relocation of the wolf population to less inhabited regions of the Sakha Republic, implementing controlled hunting practices to regulate their population, undertaking fertility control measures to reduce the wolf population's reproductive success, and working on a comprehensive program to increase the reindeer population. Conclusion: The soaring wolf numbers in the Sakha Republic have triggered a state of emergency, bringing the region's critical ecological balance and centuries-old socio-cultural practices to the brink of disaster. Addressing this crisis requires a combination of immediate targeted interventions and long-term sustainable solutions to save the reindeer herds, the indigenous communities' livelihoods, and the Sakha Republic's proud cultural heritage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He wrote many poems and opened a cultural center to bring people together, even when times were difficult. 2. Georgia: Shota Rustaveli is a lesser-known historical figure. He's important because he was a famous Georgian poet in the 12th century who wrote a beautiful poem called \\"The Knight in the Panther's Skin.\\" This poem helped shape the Georgian culture and is a symbol of bravery, friendship, and love.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Check with your local nursery or an Asian market to see if they carry jackfruit seeds. If not, you can find seeds available to purchase online. If you have access to ripe jackfruit, you can also harvest seeds from the fruit. Rinse the seeds with warm water to remove the sticky pulp. Place your seeds in a bowl or container with lukewarm water. Let them sit for a full day before sowing them. Soaking seeds will speed up the germination process and make your seedlings grow faster. Use a plastic pot with drainage holes so water can easily flow out from the bottom. Use a well-draining potting mix with perlite, sand, and organic compost to achieve the best drainage in your pot. Premixed potting soil can be purchased at gardening stores, or you can make your own. Space the seeds evenly near the center of the pot. Don’t let the seeds grow near the edges, otherwise the roots may not develop fully. Cover the seeds and press down slightly to compact the potting mix. You can plant more seeds in the pot, but they will be competing for resources and may not grow as well. Keep the soil moist, but make sure that it is not overwatered. Stick your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle to feel if it's wet. If it isn’t, water the seeds.  Even though jackfruit grows in humid, tropical regions with a lot of rainfall, too much water can cause the seeds and roots to rot. Try to use untreated or distilled water when starting off your seedlings. If you can, keep the pot outdoors during the warmest parts of the day. When the temperature gets near freezing, bring the pot indoors and keep it on a windowsill or near a window so it receives sunlight. A heat lamp indoors is a great substitute if the weather outside is not cooperating. It will take 2-3 weeks for your seedlings to germinate. Look for seedlings that have grown the tallest and have healthy looking leaves. Remove the weaker seedlings by gently pulling them out of the soil. Avoid using seedlings that are spindly or have grown near the edge of the pot. Their root systems will not have spread and developed fully.

Question: Who personally cremates Achilles? Movie plot title: Troy Movie plot: The story takes place in the fertile, eastern lands bordered by the Mediterranean Sea and kept by the gods. Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built, wars fought, alliances forged, and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox), king of Mycenae, has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly, hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles, but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill, Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon, preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius, sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation, and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However, young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus' beautiful wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy, stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone, Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother, Agamemnon, who is only too happy to oblige, though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean), king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon, goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the...

These institutions serve as essential marketplaces of ideas, history, and creative expression by providing a space where people can learn, explore, and connect with the past and present. Libraries, in particular, are vital community hubs that offer access to an array of books, publications, and digital resources. They provide both educational and recreational opportunities for people of all ages, from storytimes and reading programs for children to adult classes and workshops. Moreover, libraries often facilitate public discussions, author events, and exhibitions that help expand knowledge and encourage civil discourse among community members. Museums, on the other hand, aim to preserve and interpret elements of the past for the benefit of present and future generations. Through their engaging exhibits and collections, museums showcase various aspects of our shared human history, including art, science, culture, and nature. By doing so, museums provide valuable insights into the human experience and help foster respect and understanding among diverse communities. Other cultural activities include theaters, concert halls, galleries, and many more artistic establishments that contribute to the enrichment of our cultural lives. These spaces allow artists to showcase their creativity, inspire thought and emotion, and celebrate the human spirit. Furthermore, these cultural activities spur creativity and intellectual curiosity, fostering personal growth, and providing a space for communal experiences. The cultural activities market thrives on the exchange of ideas, inspiration, education, and enjoyment.

These institutions also contribute to the economy, both locally and nationally. They generate revenue through ticket sales, sponsorship, and donations that help fund operating costs, staff wages, and events. Additionally, cultural attractions often stimulate economic growth in surrounding areas by stimulating tourism and giving nearby businesses, such as cafes and gift shops, a boost. Furthermore, libraries, museums, and other cultural activities serve as important educational resources. They provide opportunities for formal and informal learning, from guided tours to self-directed exploration, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In many cases, these institutions partner with schools and educational organizations, helping to supplement and enrich classroom education. Lastly, cultural activities help establish a sense of local identity. By promoting the heritage and artistic achievements of a community, these institutions instill a sense of pride and belonging among residents. They also contribute to a higher quality of life, as vibrant cultural scenes often attract new residents, businesses, and further investment in a locality. In conclusion, libraries, museums, and other cultural activities play an essential role in society by nurturing intellectual curiosity, fostering a sense of belonging, and enhancing the overall quality of life.

Given the background: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding  and the situation: Two different types of animals live in the same habitat but have vastly different behaviors. Animals A and B are both the same size which is relatively small. Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator.  Answer the following question: Which group of animal is likely more fit, animal A of B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Animal B is likely more fit due to the various benefits that the large group dynamics provide in terms of anti-predator behavior and cooperative feeding. First, let's take a closer look at the role of aggregation in protection against predation. As mentioned in the background information, many species exhibit increased rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower densities. This means that each individual in a larger group can spend less time and energy on vigilance because the overall group vigilance is higher, thus resulting in more time spent on foraging and improved individual fitness. In the case of animal A, living in small groups of 4 or 5, they would require a higher level of vigilance per individual, which could lead to reduced fitness compared to animal B that lives in larger groups. In addition to the benefits of shared vigilance, the larger group size of animal B offers an advantage through the confusion effect. When species move and act in synchrony, predators struggle to single out an individual target and may become disoriented or overwhelmed, which ultimately reduces the risk of predation for the group. Animal B's large group size and coordinated movements likely confuse predators more than the smaller group size of animal A. This would provide animal B with a significant advantage over animal A in terms of avoiding and escaping predators, contributing to increased fitness. Cooperative feeding is another factor that may influence the overall fitness of these animals. Larger groups like those of animal B may be better equipped to locate and exploit food resources, as more individuals can contribute to the search and gathering process. Additionally, large groups may be better at defending food resources against competitors, ensuring a more stable and reliable food supply. On the other hand, the smaller group size of animal A may make it more challenging for them to secure and maintain food resources efficiently leading to a potential decrease in fitness. Taking these factors into account, it is likely that animal B is more fit compared to animal A due to the benefits of living in a larger group, which include increased protection against predation through shared vigilance and confusion effect, as well as advantages in cooperative feeding. This suggests that animal B would have a higher chance of survival and reproduction, leading to better overall fitness and success within their shared habitat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is a public research university in Shatin, Hong Kong formally established in 1963 by a charter granted by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. It is the territory's second oldest university and was founded as a federation of three existing colleges – Chung Chi College, New Asia College and United College – the oldest of which was founded in 1949. Hypothesis: Chung Chi College, New Asia College and United College no longer exist at the present time.","output":"Drawing the aforementioned hypothesis from the given context would not be accurate. The context informs us that The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) was founded as a federation of three existing colleges – Chung Chi College, New Asia College, and United College – with the oldest established in 1949. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether these colleges have ceased to exist in the present time. To decisively conclude that these colleges no longer exist, we would need more information or direct evidence signifying their dissolution or merger into CUHK, or stating that they no longer function as separate entities. The fact that they were unified to establish CUHK simply means they banded together for the creation of a larger, more comprehensive academic institution. It doesn't necessarily imply the extinction of individual college's identity or function within the university framework. It is quite possible that these colleges still exist within CUHK as separate constituent colleges, each maintaining their respective histories, traditions, and specialties. Many universities around the world follow a similar structure, where they are composed of numerous colleges and schools that cater to various disciplines and offer diversified learning experiences to their students. These colleges often retain their original names and identities, even after becoming part of a larger university. Collecting more information about the current organizational structure, programs offered by CUHK, and the role of these original colleges would be essential to confirming or refuting the hypothesis. An in-depth investigation into CUHK's history and evolution may also provide useful context and shed light on the current status of Chung Chi College, New Asia College, and United College."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I’m dorky and like to use little proverbs all the time. One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats. I will never feel bad for the awful plight he refuses to help himself out of. I have no patience for that type of person. Know what we call them? Toxic. Poison. A waste of time.

If carbon may be stored in limestone for million of years, then where might carbon be stored for million of years?  Answer choices: - In sediment  - stomach  - limestone  - refrigerator  - weathering  - loose dirt  - Earth  - body water","output":"Carbon can be stored for millions of years in several places, but based on the options provided, the most appropriate answer is \\"in sediment.\\" When dead organisms, plants, and other carbon-containing materials accumulate on the ocean floor or other water bodies, they form sediment layers that eventually turn into sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, through a process called lithification. This process involves compaction and cementation of the sediments, effectively trapping the carbon within the rock matrix for millions of years. Limestone is another correct answer, as it is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of calcium carbonate formed from the remains of marine organisms. As previously mentioned, after falling to the ocean floor, these remains accumulate and undergo lithification, trapping carbon in their structure for millions of years. Although carbon can be found in other listed options like the Earth, loose dirt, and body water, those storage options are usually short-term and not on the scale of millions of years. Carbon storage in the Earth, for example, could refer to fossil fuels or soils, where it might be stored only for thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. Stomach, refrigerator, and weathering are not relevant choices for long-term carbon storage on a geological time scale.

Question: The answer to the question: What was the nickname given to the largest of the four sister ships that completed a record eastbound crossing? is inside the article: With government subsidies promised, initially at 385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the..., can you guess it ?

A former boyfriend of socialite and model Tamara Ecclestone was today jailed for four years after attempting to blackmail the heiress for £200,000. Derek Rose, 33, who dated the daughter of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone in 2002, was involved in a plot in which it was claimed that he was approached to sell his story to a tabloid newspaper. Rose was included in an email mentioning the possibility of discussing 'a non-release fee' and signing a confidentiality contract. Derek Rose arrives at the Southwark Crown court today for sentencing after he was found guilty of trying to blackmail his former girlfriend Tamara Ecclestone. Tamara Ecclestone arrives at Southwark Crown Court last week for the trial of Derek Rose. An email was sent by media studies student Jakir Uddi, 20, to Ms Ecclestone’s. agent saying ‘one of the biggest tabloids’ had made a ‘life-changing. offer’ for a kiss-and-tell story when in reality, no newspaper had. approached him. The email said: ‘As you can imagine, since Miss Ecclestone’s show has. been aired, my client [Rose] has been inundated with offers from a lot of. today’s major tabloids, plus many television companies and radio. ‘Now they all seem to want to talk to my client about Tamara, and Tamara only. ‘I’ve asked my client not to talk to the press about Tamara for ten years, and have let her live her life. ‘On Monday this week we was approached (sic) by one of the biggest. tabloids with a life-changing offer of £200,000 to disclose all. ‘My client is a quiet family man, and doesn’t need the headache of this story coming out.’ Tamara Ecclestone (right) and Derek Rose (left) dated in 2002 and Rose threatened to sell intimate details about her to the press. Judge Andrew Goymer at Southwark Crown Court told Rose: 'This was an audacious attempt to obtain a large sum of money.' The court heard that he dated Ecclestone when she was 17, before changing his name by deed poll from Jonathan Ketterman. The email was sent on November 16, 2011, the day that Ms Ecclestone had starred in Billion Dollar Girl, a reality television programme exploring her life as a rich youngster. It said the newspaper had set a deadline of 1pm on November 18 for Rose to respond by. Tamara Ecclestone had just started her new show Billion Dollar Girl when she received the email. The trial heard that the email had “pernicious” implications and was sent to elicit money from Ms Ecclestone, 28. The judge said that 10 years ago, Rose, who sold his story to the Mail on Sunday in 2002, was in a relationship with Ms Ecclestone, which ended acrimoniously. 'You felt extremely hurt, and within a few days of writing a bitter message, you were selling your story to a tabloid newspaper, and that speaks volumes about your true character.' 'She came to your attention again in November 2011 when she was the subject of a television series. The email that you sent on 16th November in which you threatened to reveal personal details was not the product of a broken heart. 'All that was long in the past.' The judge added: 'It was nothing more than a cynical and greedy attempt to extract a large sum of money. 'No doubt you thought that £200,000, which is a large sum to most people, would be small change to somebody with the amount of money that she and her family are reputed to have. 'You also thought that for this reason they would readily part with it to buy your silence. She did not do this.' The judge said that the well-known, well-connected and well-off did not deserve special protection, but the reality was that they were more likely to fall victim to this type of offence. He said: 'Blackmail is always an unpleasant and vicious offence. It can properly be said to be one of the worst offences that does not involve physical injury because of the fear and insecurity that it produces.' Judge Goymer added that although Rose has ‘caring responsibilities’ for his 13-year-old son - a promising footballer- he still deserved a custodial sentence,. The jury failed to reach a verdict about media studies student Jakir Uddin who sent the email. Ms Ecclestone is famous for being the daughter of Bernie, the Formula 1 supremo. He said: ‘Although his mother is his. primary carer you have taken an active and positive part in his. upbringing and helping him to realise his ambitions. ‘He is of course entirely innocent of any involvement in this offence but your greed blinded you to the humiliation and misery that it would bring upon him. ‘There is a need to deter this type of offence which can be relatively easy to commit. ‘The least sentence I can pass on you is four years imprisonment.’ Representatives of Ms Ecclestone said that she  welcomed the sentence. Her family lawyer Charlotte Harris of the firm Mishcon de Reya said in a statement: 'Tamara Ecclestone is relieved that Judge Goymer has acknowledged, in his sentencing of Derek Rose, the serious nature of blackmail and the need to deter others from attempting to commit similar offences. 'Ms Ecclestone was content to waive her anonymity in giving evidence because she strongly believes that all people have a right to be protected from such cynical and vicious behaviour. The sentence of four years is welcomed.' Jakir Uddi stood trial alongside Rose but the jury failed to reach a verdict in his case and was discharged yesterday. He denied blackmail, claiming he was acting under orders from Rose, and is facing retrial. Highlights:","output":"1.

Today, we are going on an adventure to learn about something that is always around us but we can't see - air pressure! Don't worry, I'll be here to help you understand what air pressure is, the symbols you might find on a weather map, and what they mean. So, put on your explorer hat and let's get started! 1. What is air pressure? Air pressure is the weight of the air above us. It's like a giant invisible blanket of air that wraps around Earth. Even though we can't see it, air pressure affects our weather. Sometimes, there's more air and it's heavier, and sometimes there's less air and it's lighter. This can make the weather different in different places. 2. Air Pressure Symbols Weather maps use symbols to show us what the air pressure is like in different places. There are two main symbols you will see: - \\"H\\" for High Pressure (Anticyclone) - \\"L\\" for Low Pressure (Cyclone) These letters help us understand if there's a lot of air or just a little bit of air in that area. 3. Low Pressure System (Cyclone) When you see an \\"L\\" on a weather map, that means there's a Low Pressure System or a Cyclone. In this area, there's less air, so the air is lighter. This often causes the air to move around in a circle, like when you swirl your spoon in a bowl of soup! A Low Pressure System can bring clouds, rain, and sometimes even storms. Have you ever seen dark clouds outside and thought, \\"Uh oh, it's going to rain\\"? That's probably because there's a Low Pressure System nearby! 4. High Pressure System (Anticyclone) On the other hand, when you see an \\"H\\" on a weather map, that means there's a High Pressure System or an Anticyclone. In this area, there's more air, and it’s heavier. Instead of swirling around like in a Low Pressure System, the air in a High Pressure System usually sinks or pushes down. A High Pressure System often brings sunny and clear weather. So, when you see the sun shining and feel the warm breeze, there might be a High Pressure System in your area! Now that we've learned about air pressure and its symbols, you are a true weather explorer! The next time you see a weather map, check for the \\"L\\" and \\"H\\" symbols, and see if you can guess what the weather is like in different places. Remember, even though air pressure is invisible, it's always around us and it helps to make each day a new weather adventure!

News article: Starbucks Busted for Brewing with ‘Toilet’ Water in Hong Kong A Starbucks coffee cup in Hong Kong Okay, this is kind of gross. A Starbucks’ coffee shop in the heart of Hong Kong’s financial district was recently discovered to be brewing coffee with water from a parking garage bathroom faucet ever since it opened in October 2011. The unsavory revelation has sparked outrage and drawn criticism from clientele and other locals. (MORE: Starbucks Unveils 450 Stainless Steel Gift Card) AFP reports that local newspaper Apple Daily uncovered photos of the faucet just a few feet away from a urinal in a “dingy washroom” marked for Starbucks use. The shop itself is located in the heart of the city’s bustling financial Central district in the landmark Bank of China building. The store has acknowledged it is using the faucet to brew coffee. “There is no direct water supply to that particular store, that’s why we need to obtain the drinking water from the nearest source in the building,” Starbucks spokeswoman Wendy Pang said. She added that the shop has now switched to distilled water. “The initial decision by Starbucks to use water from toilet is a clear sign of your company’s vision and the level of (dis)respect your company has for the health and mind of your customers,” a Facebook user wrote on the Starbucks’ Hong Kong Facebook wall, reports the AFP. Though tap water in Hong Kong is said to be filtered and conforms to World Health Organization standards, many local residents continue to distrust the water’s sanitation system, citing old buildings and poorly-maintained water-storage tanks as a common concern. (MORE: Starbucks Introduces Environmentally-Friendly 1 Reusable Cups) But that’s not the real issue, others claim. “The issue that is more worrying is … the potential risk of transferring pathogens from the restroom environment into the Starbucks food preparation area,” Hong Kong University School of Public Health associate professor Benjamin Cowling told the AFP. “I wouldn’t go to the restaurant in the first place if I knew they were having potentially risky hygiene practices.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"A Starbucks coffee shop in Hong Kong was found to be using water from a bathroom faucet in a parking garage to make coffee since it opened in 2011.

Here a clear explanation. This task is asking you to round off all the given numbers to the nearest tens place. Here are the simple steps you need to follow: 1. The first step is to identify which is the nearest tens place for a number. For this, look at the last two digits of the number.  2. The tens digit is the second to last digit. If this digit is less than 5, then you round down, which means you keep the tens digit the same and turn the last digit (the units place) into 0. 3. If the tens digit is 5 or more, then you round it up. This means you add 1 to the tens digit and make the units place 0. Let's apply these steps to the numbers given in the task: - 412: The second to last digit is 1 which is less than 5, so we round down, this would become 410. - 840: Here the second to last digit is 4 again less than 5, so we round down, this would become 840. - 303: Here the second to last digit is 0 which is less than 5, so we round down, this would become 300. - -879: As this is a negative number, we're looking for the closest negative multiple of 10. The second to last digit is 7, which is over 5, so we round up, and this would become -880. - 155: Here the second to last digit is 5, which means we round up, this would become 160. - 441: The second to last digit is 4 which is less than 5, so we round down, this one becomes 440. - -666: This is a negative number. The second to last digit is 6 which is more than 5, so we round up, this would become -670. - 53: Here the second to last digit is 5, so we round up, this would become 60. - -653: This is a negative number. The second to last digit is 5, so we round up, this would become -650.

Question: Humm…you don’t categorize best as either fun or interesting so maybe I have one of each! Interesting one; while Clinton was still in office he was at a fund raising dinner at a restaurant I managed. I met his personal valet from the white house mess, Oscar, and he casually said, if you are ever in DC…. To which I replied, I sure can be! My husband and I made the trip a month or so later, we met up with Oscar for dinner on our first night there. We had just started planning all we wanted to see as it was our first visit there. We had no idea that Oscar would invite us for not one but two private tours of the White House. We saw the oval office, the situation room, the rose garden, the mess, the press room and the OEOB. We even heard Buddy bark! It was a trip I knew I’d never be able to repeat and was very grateful to have had the chance to take. For the fun one…My friend was turning 50 and she wanted a theme destination celebration. 18 of us went to Belize. She went all out.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the individual whose holdings included a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres of meadow and 330 acres of marsh? , can you please find it?   The Sleaford area has been inhabited since the late Iron Age; people settled around the ford where a prehistoric track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. A large hoard of coin moulds belonging to the Corieltauvi tribe have been uncovered in this area and dated to the late Iron Age. It was occupied by the Romans, and then by the Anglo-Saxons. The place-name Slioford first appears in 852, meaning \\"crossing over a muddy stream\\", in reference to the Slea. The settlement around the crossing came to be known as \\"Old\\" Sleaford in 13th-century sources to distinguish it from developments further west, around the present-day market place, which came to be known as \\"New\\" Sleaford. The origins of New Sleaford are not clear, leading to a theory that it was planted by the Bishop of Lincoln in the 12th century as a means of increasing his income, hence the epithet \\"New\\". The town's compass-point layout, the 12th-century date of St Denys' stonework and other topographical features offer evidence for this theory.A speculative reassessment of Domesday Book (1086) material suggests that St Denys' origins may be earlier. Two manors called Eslaforde (Sleaford) were recorded in the Domesday Book, one held by Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, the other by Ramsey Abbey. The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn, Bardi, and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins, 11 bordars, 6 sokemen, a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres (130 ha) of meadow and 330 acres (130 ha) of marsh. Ramsey Abbey had been granted land in Sleaford and surrounding villages before the Norman Conquest of England; in Domesday its fee consisted of 1 carucate, 1 sokeman, 2 villeins and 27 acres of meadow. It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey's manor of Quarrington, where he held two churches. There is no evidence for a second church at Quarrington, which suggests that the record is alluding to one in another of the abbot's manors for which Quarrington was an estate centre. The local historians David Roffe and Christine Mahany... The answer is:","output":"Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln. In the passage, it states that \\"Two manors called Eslaforde (Sleaford) were recorded in the Domesday Book, one held by Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, the other by Ramsey Abbey. The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn, Bardi, and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins, 11 bordars, 6 sokemen, a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres (130 ha) of meadow and 330 acres (130 ha) of marsh.\\" This indicates that Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, is the individual whose holdings included a church and priest, 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres of meadow, and 330 acres of marsh."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eine Einsparung von mehr als 100.000 Tonnen SKE pro Jahr entlastet die fossilen Energievorräte. Translate this to English?","output":"A savings of more than 100,000 tonnes of SKE (Standard Coal Equivalent) per year relieves the burden on fossil energy reserves. This statement highlights the importance of energy conservation and the transition to alternative energy sources. By reducing the consumption of fossil fuels, we can decrease our reliance on limited, non-renewable energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Conserving energy and shifting to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can help minimize our impact on the environment and alleviate the pressure on finite fossil energy reserves. SKE, or Standard Coal Equivalent, is a unit of measurement used to quantify energy content for different fuels. The measurement is based on the energy contained in one kilogram of coal and is typically used to compare various energy sources on a common basis. By saving more than 100,000 tonnes of SKE per year, industries and households can contribute to a more sustainable future for the planet. To achieve this level of energy savings, various strategies can be employed. These strategies can include energy-efficient technologies, improved insulation in buildings, and changes to industrial processes that focus more on recycling and circular economy principles. Public campaigns to create awareness of energy conservation and government policies that encourage or incentivize the adoption of clean energy sources can also foster meaningful change. Transitioning to renewable energy sources can further relieve the burden on fossil energy reserves while effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a key contributor to climate change. This shift can lead to numerous benefits, including improved air quality, reduced dependence on foreign energy sources, and job creation in the rapidly growing renewable energy sector. In summary, by saving more than 100,000 tonnes of SKE annually, we can support efforts to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. This will help us conserve our planet's finite resources and mitigate the negative effects of climate change, providing a more secure future for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now, you want to know how many oranges you have left. So you count them: 8 oranges - 3 oranges equals 5 oranges (5*o). So you're left with 5 oranges. Now, let's talk about the number 25. It's like you have a game where you want to find a secret number, and in this game, the total of oranges and the secret number should be zero.  So think this way: if you have 5 oranges and the total (with our secret number) must be zero, how many did you have to subtract from the 5 oranges (5*o) so that the result is zero?  The answer is 25. You have to subtract 25 so that 5 oranges - 25 equals zero. Now, your equation looks like this: 5*o - 25 = 0. To find the secret number represented by the 'o', you do the opposite of subtraction which is addition.  So if you add 25 to the other side of the equation, you get: 5*o = 25 Now, to know the value of 'o' or the secret number, you divide 25 by the number of oranges (5): o = 25 / 5 o = 5 So the secret number or the value of 'o' is 5!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the midst of the European sovereign-debt crisis, Radek Sikorski, Poland's Foreign Minister, stated in November 2011, \\"I will probably be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so, but here it is: I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity. You have become Europe's indispensable nation.\\" According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. \\"This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position at the center of the Continent.\\" Heilbrunn believes that the adage, \\"what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union\\" has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism. The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski's effusive praise for his country's western neighbor. This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.

The restructuring program includes cutting almost 6,000 jobs, a move aimed at salvaging the struggling airline and paving a new path towards profitability. Step 1: Background on Malaysia Airlines: Malaysia Airlines has been one of the leading airlines in Asia, but in recent years, the company has faced numerous challenges. These include two major incidents involving flight MH370 and MH17. The unprecedented disappearance of flight MH370 in March 2014 and the tragic downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine in July 2014 have significantly impacted the air carrier's reputation and financial performance. Step 2: Addressing the \\"Technically Bankrupt\\" Statement: The term \\"technically bankrupt\\" has been used to describe the financial statuto provide additional context on the implications of the company's financial crisis. While it does not declare legal bankruptcy, it acknowledges that the company is in severe financial distress and cannot continue operating without significant restructuring and financial support. Step 3: Introducing the Restructuring Plan: The company's chief executive has unveiled a comprehensive restructuring program to address its financial challenges. The plan consists of a series of measures aimed at reducing costs and increasing efficiency. This includes significant operational modifications, such as reducing the number of routes served and eliminating non-core activities. Step 4: The Impact of Job Cuts: One of the most drastic measures announced in the restructuring plan is the massive reduction in workforce, with 6,000 jobs to be eliminated. Employees across different departments and levels of the company will be affected, creating uncertainty for many workers in the airline industry. The job cuts will enable Malaysia Airlines to streamline its organizational structure and lower its operational costs. Step 5: The Potential Outcome of the Restructuring: While the company faces significant challenges, Malaysia Airlines hopes that the restructuring plan will lead to a successful turnaround. The goal is to create a leaner, more efficient organization that can compete effectively in the global market. By addressing its financial and operational issues head-on, the airline aims to recover from the setbacks of the past few years and rebuild its reputation. Conclusion: The \\"technically bankrupt\\" status of Malaysia Airlines calls for immediate action to address the company's financial difficulties. The restructuring plan, including cutting a significant number of jobs, is an attempt to save the struggling airline and create a more sustainable business model. Only time will tell if Malaysia Airlines can successfully overcome its current challenges and emerge as a stronger, more efficient organization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These arrests come as part of a larger operation targeting potential terrorist cells and individuals across the region. The recent arrest highlights a growing concern of radicalization and terrorist activities within the country and the neighboring Balkan nations. According to Bosnia's Intelligence and Security Agency, the individuals detained are believed to have connections with various extremist groups throughout the Middle East, including but not limited to the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, and other jihadist organizations. These groups have been known to operate across several countries, recruiting and coordinating attacks on both civilian and military targets. The arrests are a result of a combined effort by the Intelligence and Security Agency, local law enforcement, and international intelligence cooperation.  The Bosnian authorities have previously conducted multiple operations to apprehend individuals suspected of terrorist affiliations within the region. These efforts are aimed at curbing the infiltration of terrorist organizations into European territories and reducing the threat of lone-wolf attacks. Bosnia has faced increased scrutiny from its European counterparts in recent years, mainly due to the country’s perceived vulnerability to radical ideology and the fact that several of its citizens have already traveled to Syria and Iraq to join terror groups.  The difficult socio-political landscape in Bosnia is a matter of concern for its Western allies. With a fragile post-war political structure, Bosnia faces the challenge of balancing ethnic divisions and addressing the problems that arise from its borders. Furthermore, the country's struggling economy and high unemployment rate provide fertile ground for extremist groups to attract disillusioned youth, who may be more amenable to indoctrination. In order to combat these issues, Bosnian authorities have stepped up their surveillance and monitoring of suspected extremists. Cooperation with neighboring countries and key international partners has been essential to the success of these operations. In recent years, the country has seen an uptick in counter-terrorism efforts, with radical preachers being targeted, and dozens of foreign nationals being deported over alleged links to extremist organizations. However, these arrests have also raised concerns about human rights violations and potential abuses of power in Bosnia. The government's actions in targeting suspected extremists can sometimes face accusations of unfairly targeting certain ethnic or religious groups, which could actually fuel radicalism instead of eradicating it. Despite the challenges, it is vital that Bosnia continues its efforts to identify and apprehend individuals and groups with terrorist affiliations. As terrorist threats continue to evolve, the need for efficient coordination among national security agencies and international partners is crucial. This will grant the authorities the ability to intervene and thwart potential terrorist activities, not only in Bosnia but also in the region as a whole.

Although I am from out of town, is this place really good to people?? Honestly, I've had much much better cajun food.  The reason this place event gets any stars is because my waitress was very nice and patient.    I ordered one pound of shrimp with the medium house sauce, grilled sausages also with their house sauce, cajun fries, and sweet potato fries.   My shrimp came in one bag (not double bagged, like every cajun restaurant I've been to) therefore, the bag was leaking sauces.  This would not be the problem if there was more sauce to begin with. There was barely any cajun sauce, therefore I had to ask for more. Their sausages were burnt. Their cajun fries were just regular fries with a few sprinkles of seasoning.

Question: Who threatens to kill the princess? Movie plot title: Gulliver's Travels Movie plot: Deeply depressed at his dead-end job in the mail room of a New York City newspaper, Lemuel Gulliver decides to talk to journalist Darcy Silverman. He convinces her he could write a report about his (false) extensive world \\"travels\\" saying his dream is to become a writer. After suffering writer's block and thinking that Darcy will not want to hang out with a \\"guy from the mailroom\\", he plagiarises a report from other publications on the internet. The next day, Darcy, impressed by his writing, presents Gulliver with a new task â to travel to the Bermuda Triangle and write an article about the legends of ships mysteriously disappearing there. Upon arrival in Bermuda, Gulliver rents a boat and travels into the triangle. After falling asleep at the helm of his ship, he's caught in a freak storm and the boat is overwhelmed by a waterspout. He washes up unconscious on the shore of Lilliput, where he is immediately confirmed as a \\"beast\\" by the town's tiny people. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave, citizens claiming him to be dangerous because of his huge size. Here, he meets another prisoner named Horatio who was jailed by General Edward because he loves Princess Mary of Lilliput, whereas Edward also wants her. After the island across from Lilliput, Blefuscia, infiltrates commandos to kidnap Princess Mary, Gulliver manages to break free of the plough-machine he is forced to work and then rescues the princess from being kidnapped. Gulliver also saves her father, King Theodore from a fire by urinating on it. Gulliver is declared a hero by Lilliput's citizens and makes up a deal of lies saying he is the President of Manhattan, says Yoda is his Vice-President and a living legend in his homeland. Edward, however, becomes enraged due to the luxurious accommodations that have been built for him, and even being presented as an honorary general of the Lilliputian Army complete with uniform.

A:","output":"In the movie plot of \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" the threat against the princess is not committed by a single individual, but rather by the Island of Blefuscia. More specifically, the nation of Blefuscia engages in an act of aggression against the island of Lilliput by infiltrating commandos with the mission to kidnap Princess Mary of Lilliput. This group of infiltrators from Blefuscia is indeed the one threatening the princess's life by planning and attempting to kidnap her. Meanwhile, General Edward is also portrayed as a potential threat to the princess due to his desire for the princess. He jails a man named Horatio for loving Princess Mary, indicating that he may wish to remove any obstacles to his own romantic ambitions. However, General Edward's actions do not constitute a clear threat to kill the princess, even though he proves to be an antagonist in other respects. The protagonist, Lemuel Gulliver, plays a heroic role in this scenario. After learning of the plot by Blefuscia, he breaks free from his imprisonment and rescues Princess Mary from the kidnapping attempt. Not only does he save the princess, but he also saves her father, King Theodore from a fire that breaks out. His heroism is recognised by the citizens of Lilliput and he is regarded as a hero. Therefore, in response to your question, the threat to Princess Mary in the movie plot of \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" mainly comes from the group of infiltrators from the Island of Blefuscia, who plan and execute a plot to kidnap her. There are tensions and potential threats arising from the character of General Edward, yet these never explicitly take the form of a direct threat to kill the princess."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Jesse told Ash her secret today and told her not to tell anyone else.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - The Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused.  - In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries.  - Aristophanes (or  ; c. 446  c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it.  - Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes  whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis.  - The Clouds (\\"Nephelai\\") is a Greek comedy play written by the celebrated playwright Aristophanes. A lampooning of intellectual fashions in classical Athens, it was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423BC and was not as well-received as the author had hoped, coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year. It was revised between 420 and 417BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form.  - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece.  - The Wasps (\\"Sphkes\\") is the fourth in chronological order of the eleven surviving plays by Aristophanes, the master of an ancient genre of drama called 'Old Comedy'. It was produced at the Lenaia festival in 422 BC, a time when Athens was enjoying a brief respite from the Peloponnesian War following a one-year truce with Sparta.  - Carcinus ( Greek :  ) was an Ancient Greek tragedian , and was a member of a family including Xenocles ( a father or uncle ) and his grandfather Carcinus of Agrigentum . He received a prize for only one out of his one hundred and sixty plays , many of them composed at the court of Dionysius II of Syracuse . Only nine titles , with associated fragments , of his plays have survived : Achilles , Aerope or Thyestes , Ajax , Alope , Amphiaraus , Oedipus , Orestes , Semele , and Tyro . He and his sons were lampooned by Aristophanes at the end of The Wasps and in Peace . All three of those sons became playwrights . Carcinus is mentioned briefly by Aristotle . In the Poetics , Chapter 17 ( 1455a lines 22 to 29 ) , Aristotle discusses the necessity for a playwright to see the composition on the stage , rather than just in print , in order to weed out any inconsistencies . Aristotle points to an unnamed play of Carcinus which had a character , Amphiaraus , exit a temple . For some reason ( presumably the events prior ) , this seemed outrageously inconsistent when viewed on the stage , and the audience \`\` hissed '' the actors right off the stage . It seems this particular inconsistency was not easily recognised by merely reading the script .  - Syracuse (  \\"Syrakousai\\"; Medieval ) is a historic city in Sicily, the capital of the province of Syracuse. The city is notable for its rich Greek history, culture, amphitheatres, architecture, and as the birthplace of the preeminent mathematician and engineer Archimedes. This 2,700-year-old city played a key role in ancient times, when it was one of the major powers of the Mediterranean world. Syracuse is located in the southeast corner of the island of Sicily, next to the Gulf of Syracuse beside the Ionian Sea.  - Xenocles is the name of two Greek tragedians. There were two Athenian tragic poets of this name, one the grandfather of the other. No fragments of either are currently known, except for a few words of the elder apparently parodied in Aristophanes' \\"The Clouds\\".  - The Lenaia was an annual Athenian festival with a dramatic competition. It was one of the lesser festivals of Athens and Ionia in ancient Greece. The Lenaia took place in Athens in the month of Gamelion, roughly corresponding to January. The festival was in honour of Dionysos Lenaios. \\"Lenaia\\" probably comes from \\"\\"lenos\\"\\" 'wine-press' or from \\"\\"lenai\\"\\", another name for the Maenads (the female worshippers of Dionysos).  - Dionysius the Younger or Dionysius II (343 BC) was a Greek politician who ruled Syracuse, Sicily from 367 BC to 357 BC and again from 346 BC to 344 BC.

Keskustelun alulle saaminen voi olla hyvä tapa lähestyä monimutkaista aihetta, koska se antaa osapuolille mahdollisuuden ilmaista näkemyksensä ja esittää omia ratkaisujaan. Tällainen lähestymistapa voi mahdollistaa avoimen ja joustavan keskustelun, jossa kaikki voivat osallistua ja jossa erilaiset argumentit ja näkökulmat huomioidaan päätöksenteon aikana. On tärkeää, että keskusteluun osallistuu monenlaisia tahoja, jotta saadaan mahdollisimman monipuolinen näkemysten kirjo. Tämä voi auttaa komissiota ja muita toimielimiä ymmärtämään tilanteen monimutkaisuutta ja löytämään sopivimmat ratkaisut ongelmiin. Yksinkertaisen ratkaisun esittäminen saattaa johtaa monimutkaisempien, innovatiivisten ja tehokkaiden ratkaisujen löytymiseen, kun osallistujat pohtivat, kehittävät ja vertaavat erilaisia vaihtoehtoja. On myös hyvä pitää mielessä, että yksinkertainen ratkaisu ei välttämättä tarkoita, että se olisi paras tai ainoa mahdollinen ratkaisu. Yksinkertaiset ratkaisut ovat usein hyviä lähtökohtia, mutta ne saattavat myös kohdata kritiikkiä, koska ne eivät ehkä huomioi kaikkia asiaan liittyviä tekijöitä ja vaikutuksia. Tämän vuoksi on tärkeää, että keskustelussa käydään läpi erilaisia vaihtoehtoja ja niiden vahvuuksia sekä heikkouksia, jotta voidaan kehittää tehokkaimmat ja vastuullisimmat ratkaisut haasteisiin.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Jonah or Jonas is the name given in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh/Old Testament) to a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel in about the 8th century BCE. He is the eponymous central figure of the Book of Jonah, in which he is called upon by God to travel to Nineveh and warn its residents to repent of their sins or face divine wrath. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to Tarshish. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. Jonah is regarded as a saint by a number of Christian denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the Martyrologium Romanum. In Catholicism, the Book of Jonah is also read aloud in its entirety on Maundy Thursday in a Beneventan chant. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, Jonah's feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian calendar; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern Gregorian calendar). In the Armenian Apostolic Church, moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the Twelve Minor Prophets. Jonah's mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the Fast of Nineveh in Syriac and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the Calendar of Saints of the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church on 22 September.  Christian theologians have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a type for Jesus Christ. Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of Jesus's crucifixion and the fish vomiting Jonah out onto the beach was seen as a parallel for Jesus's resurrection. Saint Jerome equates Jonah with Jesus's more nationalistic side, and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that \\"Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people.\\"  Other Christian interpreters, including Saint Augustine and Martin Luther, have taken a directly opposite approach, regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people. Luther likewise concludes that the kikayon represents Judaism, and that the worm which devours it represents Christ. Luther's antisemitic interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history. J. D. Michaelis comments that \\"the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes\\", and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against \\"the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth.\\" Albert Eichhorn was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation.  John Calvin and John Hooper regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God. While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah, Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt. Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of Hell, intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness. Also unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story, describing the sailors on the boat as \\"hard and iron-hearted, like Cyclops\\", the penitence of the Ninevites as \\"untrained\\", and the king of Nineveh as a \\"novice\\". Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the archetypal dissident and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state. Hooper deplores such dissidents, decrying: \\"Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!\\" Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"\\"Jonah is a prophet from the Hebrew Bible who was asked by God to go to Nineveh and tell people there to stop doing bad things. Instead, Jonah tried to go somewhere else on a ship, but ended up being thrown into the sea and swallowed by a big fish. Many Christian groups think of Jonah as a special, holy person. They remember him on special days and think that his story teaches important lessons. Some people see Jonah's story as similar to the story of Jesus, while others think it teaches about how people can sometimes be jealous or scared, and how they need to trust in God.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Where does the Glacier des Diablerets located? A:","output":"The Glacier des Diablerets, or Diablerets Glacier, is a spectacular natural formation located within the heart of the Swiss Alps. This glacier is situated in the western part of Switzerland, in the canton of Vaud. The region boasts stunning landscapes, pristine alpine vistas, and a range of recreational opportunities for locals and visitors alike. The Diablerets Glacier is nestled between two mountain peaks: Les Diablerets, which stands at an imposing 3,210 meters (10,530 feet) and Le Dôme, rising to an impressive 2,996 meters (9,826 feet). The glacier is an integral part of the expansive massif called Massif des Diablerets, which is a prominent mountain range in Switzerland. It extends over an area of approximately 14 square kilometers (5.4 square miles) and, at its thickest, the ice reaches a depth of around 200 meters (656 feet). The official coordinates of the Glacier des Diablerets are 46.3211° N latitude and 7.1944° E longitude, placing it within easy reach of several popular Swiss destinations. To the north of the glacier lies the picturesque Gstaad-Saanenlander region of Canton Bern, an area renowned for its ski resorts and charming villages. To the south, one can find the Rhône Valley, stretching from the imposing Rhône Glacier to Lake Geneva, providing a striking contrast between glaciated landscapes and lush vineyards. The Glacier des Diablerets plays a significant role in the local climate and ecosystems. Fed by heavy snowfall in the winter months and melting in the summer, the glacier serves as an essential source of fresh water for nearby areas. Additionally, it's a crucial habitat for numerous alpine flora and fauna species adapted to the harsh conditions that come with living at high altitudes. Tourism in the region has grown over the years, and the Diablerets Glacier has become a prime destination for various winter sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and mountaineering. Several ski resorts, including Les Diablerets and Villars-sur-Ollon, cater to tourists and locals seeking thrilling snow-filled adventures. The nearby Glacier 3000, accessible via cable car, provides visitors with panoramic views of the surrounding peaks and an opportunity to witness the glacier's formidable power up close. In the summer months, tourists can partake in several outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain biking, and paragliding, among others. The region also boasts several scenic trails, including the Via Alpina and the Tour des Muverans. Despite the beauty of the Glacier des Diablerets, climate change is having a significant impact on the glacier's size and stability. Scientists have recorded declining ice masses in the past decades. This shrinking poses a threat to both the natural environment and the winter tourism industry so vital to the Swiss economy. In conclusion, the Glacier des Diablerets, located in the beautiful Swiss Alps, is an incredible natural wonder attracting tourists and adventurers from all over the world. Its imposing size and position between two notable peaks make it a must-visit destination for those wishing to experience the unique combination of awe and serenity that alpine environments can provide. However, the glacier's vulnerability to climate change highlights the importance of preserving these delicate environments for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read this article and answer this question John Fox, joined by coordinators Adam Gase and Jeff Rodgers and quarterback Jay Cutler, faced their former team in the Denver Broncos for week eleven. It would also be the coldest game the Bears would play in 2015. In 14 games, the two teams split the series, though the Broncos won the most recent game in 2011 13-10. In the last game at Soldier Field, the Bears won 37-34. The offense took on one of the league's top defenses, Denver's pass rush leading the NFL in sacks with 32, with twelve players with at least .5 sacks. The Broncos defense was allowing the fewest average yards with 277.3, while also allowing the third-least points per game with 18.7. Despite DeMarcus Ware being out with a back injury, the Broncos still had Von Miller, who had more than five sacks in 2015. For the Bears, despite Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal's injuries, Martellus Bennett and Zach Miller could still play a role. If passing, Cutler had to watch for defensive lineman Malik Jackson, who had four pass breakups in the previous four games. When the Bears decide to run, they faced a run defense that led the league in multiple categories, including sack percentage. The Broncos offense was without Peyton Manning, and in his place was Brock Osweiler. Osweiler, who had 305 career passing yards, had only played in garbage time during his NFL career, but fits Gary Kubiak's West Coast offense. Jeff Joniak believed with Osweiler, the Broncos' plays, which consisted of 64 percent passes, would decrease, though tight ends Owen Daniels and Vernon Davis could be targeted more often. Meanwhile, Denver's rushing attack was struggling during the season, with an average of 86 rushing yards per game, 29th-ranked in the NFL. The Broncos won the coin toss and deferred until the second half. After the Bears punted, Osweiler threw a pass to Demaryius Thomas, who escaped Chris Prosinski to score on the 48-yard play. After both teams exchanged punts, the Bears scored their first points of the game in the second quarter with Robbie Gould's 46-yard field goal, and narrowed the margin to one point when Gould scored on a 37-yard kick. Denver and Chicago traded punts again, but the former scored with Brandon McManus' 24-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter to make the score 10-6. The first three drives of the second half ended with punts, though the first turnover of the game occurred on the next series, when Cutler's pass for receiver Marquess Wilson was intercepted by Danny Trevathan. However, the Broncos failed to capitalize when Ronnie Hillman was tripped by Osweiler's feet on fourth down. Afterwards, aided by two consecutive 29-yard plays (via Brandon Marshall's defensive pass interference, followed by Wilson's 29-yard catch), the Bears reached the Broncos' 19-yard line, where Gould eventually kicked a 37-yard field goal. The Broncos later increased their lead by eight when Osweiler threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Cody Latimer. On the Bears' next series, Cutler capitalized on a late hit by T. J. Ward and a 40-yard pass to Wilson to reach the Broncos' seven-yard line. Despite reaching as far as the four, the Bears turned the ball over on downs with three consecutive incomplete passes. Although Denver punted again and the Chicago offense reaching the Broncos' 33-yard line, Cutler was hit from behind by Marshall while throwing, and the ball was intercepted by Malik Jackson. The Broncos were forced to punt again, and with 1:25 left in the game, the Bears drove 65 yards, where Jeremy Langford scored on a two-yard run. However, Langford was stopped short on the two-point conversion, and on the onside kick, Thomas recovered. Osweiler kneeled once to end the game. The Bears ended the game with no penalties for the first time since 1995 against the Philadelphia Eagles and becoming the 24th team to do so in the last 15 years; the Bears also became the first team to accomplish the feat in a loss since the 2013 Packers' loss to the Bears in week nine.

Let us elaborate on each point for a more in-depth understanding: 1. Spacious cab - The text refers to a cab that has ample space inside, presumably providing comfort and practicality, which are essential features in any vehicle. A spacious cab could notably enhance the driving experience of passengers while ensuring they have enough room for their belongings. 2. Due to new profile angles - The additional space in the cab can be attributed to the implementation of new profile angles. In the context of vehicle design, profile angles refer to the slope and contour of the vehicle's exterior surfaces. By utilizing new angles for the car's design, manufacturers can optimize the use of available space and develop a more spacious interior without significantly altering the overall size or shape of the vehicle. 3. Increased width between the profiles - Another contributing factor to the spacious cab can be the increased width between the profiles. This means that the distance between the exterior panels or structural elements of the car has been expanded, consequently providing more room for occupants inside the cab. This design change may not only improve legroom and shoulder space for passengers but can also allow for additional storage options or even the installation of new features and technologies. 4. The combination of these improvements - By combining both new profile angles and increased width between the profiles, vehicle manufacturers can create an even more spacious cab that offers optimal comfort and practicality for drivers and passengers alike. This can lead to an enhanced driving experience and a greater level of satisfaction for consumers in the long run. In summary, the given text highlights the importance of innovative vehicle design in maximizing available space and enhancing the overall experience for both passengers and drivers.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Paragraph: Josie started planning her new garden in the winter. She chose flowers and vegetables that could grow in her area. She looked through the seed magazines. She ordered the tastiest kind of each vegetable and the prettiest kind of each flower. She talked to a friend about her plans. It seemed like the snow would never melt. But Josie didn't have to wait for spring to get started. Six weeks before the last frost, Josie planted seeds indoors. The tiny seedlings pushed up through the soil and began to grow. Finally spring arrived. Each day, Josie moved the seedlings outside for a few hours so they could get used to the cooler temperatures. Josie worked in her garden, digging the soil. She added a special growing mix from the garden store to make the soil better. When everything was ready, she removed the seedlings from their trays and planted them in her garden. The warm sun and rich soil helped her vegetables and flowers grow.  Question: \\"How did Josie get started on her garden during the winter?\\" Answer: \\"Took them out each day in spring\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the provided answer is not correct based on the paragraph. Instead, the correct answer should be: During the winter, Josie started planning her new garden by choosing flowers and vegetables suitable for growing in her area. She browsed seed magazines, ordered the tastiest types of vegetables and the prettiest types of flowers, and discussed her plans with a friend. Furthermore, six weeks before the last frost, Josie began planting seeds indoors, allowing the seedlings to grow until spring arrived."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context I sat there feeling rather like a chappie I'd once read about in a book , who murdered another cove and hid the body under the dining-room table , and then had to be the life and soul of a dinner party, with *it* there all the time. Are \\"book\\" and \\"it\\" the same?","output":"To determine if \\"book\\" and \\"it\\" are the same in the given context, let's analyze the sentence step-by-step: 1. First, let's identify the subjects and objects in the sentence. The main subject is \\"I\\" (the person narrating the scene). The objects are the \\"chappie\\" (the person being described), the \\"book\\" (the source of the chappie's story), and \\"it\\" (referring to the hidden body). 2. Next, let's understand the context. The narrator is comparing their feeling to that of the chappie from a book. The chappie murdered someone, hid the body, and had to act normally during a dinner party with the body hidden nearby. 3. Now let's look at the usage of \\"book\\" and \\"it\\" in the sentence. The \\"book\\" refers to the source of the story about the chappie and his actions, while \\"it\\" refers to the hidden body in the chappie's story. In conclusion, based on the context and analysis, \\"book\\" and \\"it\\" are not the same. \\"Book\\" refers to the source of the story (the book the narrator read), and \\"it\\" refers to the hidden body (the object that causes the tension in the chappie's story and the narrator's feelings)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which gardener observed more improved mineral nutrient absorption from the soil?  Two gardeners started their planting season at the same time. Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest.  Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. A:","output":"Bill, the gardener who used mycorrhizal fungi compost, observed more improved mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. This is because the mycorrhizal fungi form a symbiotic relationship with the plant roots, increasing the surface area of the root system and subsequently improving water and mineral nutrient absorption."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: You might not want a holiday in your hometown, but there is probably someone who does. And, in exchange, you could have a cheap vacation anywhere in the world. Just picture the scene: you're watching the sunset from the balcony of a Caribbean island house. It's large. And it's free as long as you don't mind the owners living in your home at the same time. All you need to be a home-swapper is the Internet and a rough idea of when and where you want to go on holiday. When you find someone whose dates match yours, and who wants to visit your area, you're all set to swap. The advantages are numerous: you can save a fortune in accommodation cost. You could get to use the owners' car, boat, bikes, pool or gym. You might even be able to come to an arrangement about looking after each other's pets! You also get to live like a local, and you might be invited around to neighbors' homes for tea, barbecues and tips on the area. People say that these cultural experiences are the memories that last. Plus, instead of one tiny hotel room, you have an entire house where you can make yourself at home. And it's not cold and impersonal like a hotel room. Of course, there are disadvantages. A lot of effort and communication are needed before the arrangements are finalized. Nobody wants a stranger living in their house, sleeping in their bed and using their bathroom, so you have to get to know each other well beforehand. Some people are concerned about theft or property damage, but in reality this is very rare. Most home-exchangers have the view that \\"If they can trust me with their house, I can trust them with mine.\\" The worse complaint people have is the difference in standards of cleanness. If you're interested in home-exchange for your next holiday, start by contacting a famous agency like homelink.org and intervac,co.uk. These agencies will also have advice about preparing for a home-exchange. Question: If you want to exchange your home with another, you should do all of the following EXCEPT  _  .
