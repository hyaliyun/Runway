Write some highlights for the following article: Wojciech Szczesny is excited about the competition for Arsenal's No 1 jersey this season after the club signed David Ospina from Nice. Ospina moved to the Emirates in July after shining for Colombia as they reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil. Szczesny says that after Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea when his contract expired it was inevitable that Arsene Wenger would strengthen in that position during the current transfer window. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arteta expecting great season. Relishing the competition: Arsenal's number one in action during training ahead of the new season. Battle to be number one: Szczesny has said the arrival of David Ospina has not faze him in the slightest. 'I love a challenge,' the Polish shot-stopper told Arsenal.com. 'I was expecting someone to come because Lukasz has left for Swansea and I wish him all the best. I knew someone would come in. I'm just going to do the same thing over again, I'm going to try my best in every game and every week in training. Hopefully that will be enough.' Szczesny, who played in Sunday's Emirates Cup defeat to Monaco, thinks the first-team squad are reaching the right level of fitness ahead of the new Premier League campaign. 'It would have been nice to win a cup that we play at home, but that's not what we talk about in pre-season,' he said. 'We want to prepare and make sure we are at our very best at the weekend [in the Community Shield] and then against Crystal Palace in [the Premier League]. 'Last year we had a long pre-season and we played a lot of games in Asia. This year is completely different but I think everyone is looking sharper every single day.' Pedigree: Ospina was first choice for Colombia at the World Cup as they made it to the quarter-finals. Safe hands: The 25-year-old put in some fine performances for Jose Pekerman's side during the tournament. The 24-year-old is confident that by signing the likes of Ospina, Alexis Sanchez and Mathieu Debuchy, the club can push on from their performances last season, during which they won the FA Cup, their first trophy in nine years. 'We were close to being right near the top last year in the Premier League and we managed to win the FA Cup. This year we added some players and we're looking stronger. The confidence is flying high and hopefully this year we can challenge for the Premier League.'

How do you do this: How do you place snaps into leather?","output":"To place snaps into leather, you need to follow a systematic step-by-step approach. Here's how you can do it: Step 1: Gather the necessary materials and tools To place snaps into leather, you will need: 1. Leather of your choice 2. Snap set (consisting of cap/socket and stud/post pieces) 3. Leather hole punch or awl 4. Snap setting tools (anvil and setter) 5. Rubber or rawhide mallet 6. Ruler or measuring tape 7. A soft, non-scratch surface (like a cutting mat or a piece of scrap leather) Step 2: Measure and mark the leather Using a ruler or measuring tape, measure the location where you want to place the snap. Mark the leather with a visible but removable mark, like a chalk or pencil dot. Step 3: Punch or create a hole in the leather Use a leather hole punch or awl to create a hole in the leather where you want to place the snap. The hole should be the same diameter as the snap post. Make sure you punch through the leather completely and cleanly. Step 4: Insert the cap and socket pieces Take the cap (the decorative part of the snap) and insert its post through the hole from the front (right) side of the leather. The cap should sit flush against the leather. Take the socket piece (the female part) and place it on the post, with the open side facing towards the cap. Step 5: Set the cap and socket Place the leather with the cap and socket on the snap setting anvil (a small metal piece designed for snap setting), aligning the cap with the concave part of the anvil. Place the setter tool over the socket and strike it with a rubber or rawhide mallet until the post of the cap is fully seated inside the socket. Check to ensure the cap and socket are firmly attached to each other and the leather. Step 6: Insert the stud and post pieces On the other corresponding piece of leather, create a hole as you did in step 3. Insert the post (the male part of the snap) through the hole from the back (wrong) side of the leather. Place the stud (the male counterpart of the socket) on the post with the open side facing the post. Step 7: Set the stud and post Place the leather with the stud and post on another snap setting anvil designed for the stud/post combination, aligning the post with the concave part of the anvil. Place the setter tool over the stud and strike it with the mallet until the post is fully seated inside the stud. Check to ensure the stud and post are firmly attached to each other and the leather. Step 8: Test the snap Finally, test the snap by connecting the cap/socket and stud/post parts together, ensuring they snap securely in place and can be unsnapped without coming apart unintentionally. Now you have successfully placed snaps into leather!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954.

White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race.  But I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate.

Background: Born in La Ceiba, Honduras to an American father and a mother of Spanish heritage, Stephen Wood Van Buren was orphaned at age ten and was sent to live with relatives in New Orleans, Louisiana. There he attended Warren Easton High School, and tried out for the football team originally as a sophomore, but did not make the team. Later that year he dropped out of high school and went to work in an iron foundry. He returned to high school two years later and made the team as an end his senior year. Context: Van Buren claimed his second rushing title in 1947, which was the first in a string of three straight. His 1,008 rushing yards broke the single-season record of 1,004 set by Beattie Feathers with the Chicago Bears in 1934. He was no longer returning punts for the team, as the role was taken over by halfback Bosh Pritchard, though he still returned kickoffs. His 95-yard kickoff return touchdown against the Washington Redskins in the first game of the season was again the longest kickoff return by any player that season, as well as the last kick return touchdown of his career.  The Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers both finished the 1947 regular season atop the Eastern Conference with an 8-4 record, so the two teams met for a tiebreaker game to determine the conference champion. During the week before the game, the Steelers ran workouts concentrating on a means of stopping Van Buren's running. In the game, the Steelers' defensive line held Van Buren to 45 rushing yards and no rushing touchdowns, but he scored the game's first touchdown on a 15-yard reception from quarterback Tommy Thompson. The Eagles won with a 21-0 shutout, setting them up to face the Chicago Cardinals in the NFL Championship Game, the first championship game appearance in franchise history. Against the Cardinals' \\"Million Dollar Backfield\\", Van Buren was held in check, as the Eagles were defeated 28-21 in a back-and-forth contest.  The 1948 season was the second straight that Van Buren led the league in carries, rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, and yards from scrimmage. In Week 3, in the first quarter against the New York Giants Van Buren scored his 39th career rushing touchdown, surpassing Ernie Nevers as the all-time leader. That game--a 45-0 shutout win--was the first in an eight-game winning streak for the Eagles in which they scored 275 points total and allowed 49. The team finished the regular season with the best record in the Eastern Division and were to meet the Chicago Cardinals again for the league championship. Question: Did he rush for more yards in 1948?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Stephen Van Buren rushed for more yards in 1948 than he did in 1947.

They loved to sing songs together. They were so good at it that they decided to make music as a team. Their team is called Ward Thomas, just like their last name. This way, everyone knows they are sisters who sing together! Now, their favorite type of music is called \\"country music.\\" Country music is special because it tells stories about real life, like growing up, falling in love, and spending time with family. Catherine and Lizzy loved listening to country singers from a faraway place called America, and they wanted to bring that kind of music to their home in Britain. So they started singing songs with guitars, boots, and cowboy hats. Well, not really cowboy hats, but they still made their songs sound like country music! They wrote their own songs about their lives, their friends, and their beautiful home in the countryside. One day, someone heard them singing and thought they were really good. This person helped them make a magic disc called a \\"CD\\" that had their voices and music on it. The CD was called \\"From Where We Stand,\\" and it had 12 songs on it. People all around Britain started listening to it, and they loved it very much. Their music made people dance, laugh, and sometimes even cry. Their songs were about real feelings, experiences, and emotions. They even sang about important issues like being kind, strong, and happy. People all over the world started listening to their music, enjoying their beautiful voices, and learning their stories too. As more people listened to their country music, Catherine and Lizzy became known as the \\"Country Music Queens.\\" They traveled around the world, singing their songs and making people happy. They even made more CDs with new songs for everyone to enjoy. Today, Ward Thomas continues to make lovely country music. The sisters are very talented and hardworking, and they love to sing together just like when they were little girls.

Given the context: Why did Taylor do that?  Possible answers: find new school, get some help, get bullied Answer:","output":"Taylor told Alex about the bullying at school because they were seeking help and support. As someone Taylor trusts, Alex could potentially provide a safe space for them to share their experiences and emotions. This not only helps Taylor process what is happening but also allows them to explore different solutions together. By talking to Alex, Taylor might be trying to gain some validation and reassurance that their feelings and experiences are valid, as bullying can make a person feel isolated and unheard. It is important for Taylor to have someone in their life who can empathize and acknowledge their struggles, helping them feel understood and less alone. Additionally, discussing the bullying with Alex could also be a way for Taylor to brainstorm possible solutions or actions to take in response to the negative treatment they are receiving. Alex could offer suggestions on what steps Taylor might take, such as approaching a teacher or school counselor, confronting the bully, or seeking out support from a parent or another trusted adult. Moreover, discussing the situation with Alex could provide Taylor with moral support and encouragement to address the issue. Knowing that someone is in their corner can give Taylor the confidence to stand up against the bullying and seek help from the appropriate parties. Lastly, Taylor might be telling Alex about their experiences with bullying to raise awareness about the broader issue. They might want Alex to understand the reality of bullying – the negative impact it has on the lives of those involved – and to be an ally in creating a more positive environment not just for Taylor but for everyone else who may be facing similar challenges. In summary, Taylor shared their experiences of bullying with Alex in order to seek help, gain emotional support, explore possible solutions, garner moral support, and raise awareness about the issue of bullying. Through this approach, Taylor is taking steps to address the problem and empower themselves to create a safer and more inclusive environment for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the iron is exposed to the air while wet happens, how will it affect MORE rust forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Step 1: Water comes into contact with something made of iron The presence of water starts the rusting process. Step 2: The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid The mixture of water and carbon dioxide creates a weak acidic environment, contributing to the corrosion of the iron surface. Step 3: As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve The carbonic acid starts reacting with the iron, causing it to dissolve slowly, which paves the way for the formation of rust. Step 4: Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen In this step, water molecules break down into their constituent elements - hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen plays a critical role in the formation of rust, while hydrogen plays a less significant role. Step 5: The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together The released oxygen now reacts with the dissolved iron, forming a bond between them. Step 6: They form iron oxide, which is rust The reaction between oxygen and dissolved iron results in the production of iron oxide, commonly known as rust. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose the iron is exposed to the air while wet, how will it affect MORE rust forming? When the iron is exposed to the air while wet, it provides a conducive environment for the rust formation process to accelerate. Since air contains moisture and carbon dioxide, the increased interaction between the wet iron surface and the air would intensify the formation of carbonic acid, further promoting the dissolution of iron. Moreover, the wet environment aids in the breakdown of more water molecules, thus providing a greater supply of oxygen, which reacts with the dissolved iron to produce more rust. In conclusion, the perturbation of having the iron exposed to the air while wet causes a direct effect on the rust formation process. It accelerates the formation of rust by promoting a more rapid reaction between the elements present on the iron surface and in the air, thereby resulting in more rust formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What do people with sun damaged skin reading this article probably think of facial creams? Options:  A. they probably think it will make their skin improve its condition  B. not enough information  C. they probably think it is worthless  D. they probably don't care about it Answer:","output":"A. they probably think it will make their skin improve its condition"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Article: Contrary to common belief, social media websites such as Facebook do not weaken personal ties, they strengthen them in unique ways for different age groups, according to a new study. The rapid spread of Facebook, which has more than 500 million users worldwide, has prompted concerns about its negative effects, but researchers at the University of Texas have reached a different conclusion. \\"Our findings suggest that Facebook is not replacing face-to-face interactions between friends, family and colleagues,\\" said S.Craig Watkins, an associate professor of radio, TV and film who headed the research team. \\"In fact, we believe there is sufficient evidence that social media afford opportunities for new expressions of friendship, intimacy and community.\\" The researchers questioned 900 college students and recent graduates about how and with whom they interact on Facebook. More than 60 percent of Facebook users said posting status updates was among the most popular activities, followed by 60 percent who wrote comments on their profile and 49 percent who posted messages and comments to friends. The researchers also found that although about the same number of men and women use Facebook, they do so in different ways. \\"There is a noteworthy difference in aims in how to use a tool like Facebook.We found that for women the content tends to be more affectionate, and (they) are especially interested in using it for connection,\\" said Watkins. \\"For men, it's more functional,\\" he added. Watkins pointed out that, for example, women are more likely to post pictures of social gatherings with friends, while men are more likely to post pictures of hobbies, or post a political or pop-culture related link. Question: What's the popular viewpoint of ordinary people about the function of social media websites? They think   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"It has negative effects on personal ties\\"? Answer:","output":"The popular viewpoint of ordinary people about the function of social media websites is that they tend to weaken personal ties and have negative effects on interpersonal relationships. This belief stems from the idea that social media platforms, like Facebook, may replace face-to-face interactions with virtual ones, possibly leading to the deterioration of the quality of personal connections. However, according to a study conducted by researchers at the University of Texas, this common belief might be misconstrued. The study suggests that social media websites, such as Facebook, do not weaken personal ties. Instead, they strengthen them in unique ways for different age groups. The research found that Facebook is not replacing face-to-face interactions between friends, family, and colleagues. On the contrary, there is sufficient evidence to show that social media provides opportunities for new expressions of friendship, intimacy, and community.

Additionally, the researchers discovered that men and women use Facebook in different ways, with women focusing more on connection and affection, while men use it in a more functional manner. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"Yes or no, is the answer 'It has negative effects on personal ties'?\\" would be \\"No\\".

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. According to the above context, answer the following question. After the end of the this story, how does Putin feel toward Trump? Answer:","output":"The text does not provide information on how Vladimir Putin feels toward Donald Trump after the events described in the story. It mainly focuses on the political turmoil surrounding Trump's administration and the implications for the mid-term elections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: All boys and girls like good stories. I am sure that all children who read The Ugly Duckling will be glad to know something about the 'King of Story Tellers', who wrote it for them. Thousands and thousands of children have read this story, only to ask for it again and again. It has travelled the wide world over, and has been told in every country. Hans Christian Andersen, the author of \\"The Ugly Duckling,\\" was born in Denmark. If you look on a map, you will see this little country in northern Europe. There, in the little village of Odense, he spent his boyhood. His father and mother were very poor. The family lived in two little rooms near the top of a house, where his father worked as a shoemaker. On the roof was a box filled with earth. In this box his mother planted her vegetables. Little Hans loved to walk with his father in the woods, where he could pick wild flowers and hear the birds sing. His father read to him when his work was done, or told him stories. What his father did helped him open up a new world. Once, when Hans was still a child, he went into a wheat field with his mother and a number of children, to pick the rest wheat which the reapers  had left in the field. While they were busy picking only a small amount of wheat for each of them, an angry bailiff  came rushing into the field, armed with a whip . All ran, as fast as they could, away from the angry man. _ and the sharp stalks  of the wheat plants which had been cut down, cut his feet so that he could not get away. Unafraid, the boy faced the angry man and his upraised whip. \\"How dare you hit me when you know God sees you?\\" he cried, looking fearlessly into the face of the angry bailiff. The whip came down, but not on little Hans. The bailiff admired the boy's courage, and praised him for it. He sent him home with gifts, rather than punishments.[:] While Hans was still a boy, his kind father died. Then Hans and his mother were left alone, to care for each other. \\"What will you do, Hans?\\" the mother asked \\"Would you like to become a... Question: What do you think the meaning of the underline sentence \\"  _  \\" is? - There was something wrong with Little Hans' feet. - Little Hans did not wear shoes. - Little Hans was a disabled boy. - Little Hans' feet were cut by a sharp knife.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn. If you have to lash out, lash at solving the situation you are in instead the person who caused it. It is significantly more productive that way. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why was the handyman angry?","output":"The handyman was angry because his paid assistant did not show up to help him with the task of installing heavy gypsum wallboard panels onto the ceiling, and the assistant did not call or return his messages. This left the handyman to figure out how to complete the project on his own."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

By Daily Mail Reporter A police officer has appeared in court after it is alleged he used his Taser gun on a 10-year-old schoolboy who refused to clean his patrol car. Officer Chris Webb is accused of saying to the boy he would be shown 'what happens to people who do not listen to police' during the event at Tularosa Intermediate School in New Mexico. He is then reported to have fired the 50,000-volt weapon at the boy. Rachel Higgins, legal representative for the seven-stone boy, known only as RD, told Santa Fe County Court he had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder since the incident on May 4.","output":"The shocking event has sparked outrage among the community, leading to a thorough investigation and a growing concern for the proper use of force by police officers when interacting with minors. Officer Webb's actions are now under close scrutiny as the case unfolds, revealing a deeper issue regarding the balance between enforcing the law and maintaining public safety. The trial, set to commence in the following weeks, will have significant implications on how law enforcement officials are expected to handle situations involving uncooperative children in the future, potentially leading to new policies and procedures in place to prevent such horrifying incidents from occurring in similar contexts. Meanwhile, the school officials are reviewing their collaboration with law enforcement and looking into additional training to ensure student safety and well-being. As the victim's family seeks justice for RD, the incident serves as a sobering reminder of the need for continuous education and improvement within our law enforcement agencies, emphasizing the critical importance of compassion, understanding, and restraint when working with vulnerable populations like children. The repercussions of this case will likely have a lasting impact on the way police officers interact with young individuals, prompting a much-needed dialogue in communities across the nation about the role of police and the consequences of excessive force. The anticipated outcome of this trial, as well as any potential disciplinary actions against Officer Webb, will undoubtedly set the tone for how similar cases will be adjudicated in the future, as society grapples with the complexities of law enforcement in an ever-changing, increasingly tense world."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The virus \\"Ebola\\" is named after the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That's where the virus was discovered in 1976. A person can only get Ebola through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, for example, sweat or spit. Additionally, the virus can get into your body through your eyes and mouth if those areas come into contact with something that contains the bodily fluids of an infected person. That's why health care workers are supposed to keep themselves completely covered while treating patients. The deadliest Ebola outbreak is spreading fast in Western Africa, taking over 900 lives so far. The health systems in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are severely lacking in resources, and health care workers may not have access to adequate protective clothing when working in rural clinics, where the proper protections are lacking. Since Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia share a border; it's easier for people to move from one country to another, increasing the risk for disease spread. For now, all doctors can do is treat the symptoms and provide supportive care like monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing while making sure the patients' fluids are supplied. Sometimes patients are given antibiotics  to treat other possible infections. The hope is to make the patient pull through the infection so their immune system can eventually clear the virus. The people who survive Ebola have created enough antibodies to kill it. There are several promising drugs and vaccines in development, but since Ebola is less common--and research about it is not well funded -- there is no drug or vaccine that has been approved for use in humans. Many of the other drugs and vaccines have not yet been tested in humans. The WHO (World Health Organization) is meeting next week to discuss whether experimental treatments should be used during this outbreak. Question: Why have there been no cures used for Ebola in humans so far? - There are not enough drugs for the infected people. - Ebola is rare and its research money is lacking. - The people have enough antibodies to kill Ebola. - The WHO has decided not to use them.

Sentence 1: Rapper Eminem mentions Dr. Dre in his song Guilty Conscience , in which Dee Barnes is featured . Sentence 2: Rapper Eminem mentions Dr. Dre in his song Guilty Conscience , in which Dee Barnes occurs . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"While the two sentences share similarities and convey related information, they do not convey the exact same information due to the differences in the use of \\"featured\\" and \\"occurs.\\"  Sentence 1: Rapper Eminem mentions Dr. Dre in his song Guilty Conscience, in which Dee Barnes is featured. In Sentence 1, the use of the word \\"featured\\" implies an active role for Dee Barnes in the song Guilty Conscience. To be \\"featured\\" on a track typically means that an artist is contributing in some capacity, such as providing vocals, lyrics, or production. This suggests that Dee Barnes is a collaborator or guest artist on the song and likely has a visible or audible presence, adding value through her own unique input. Sentence 2: Rapper Eminem mentions Dr. Dre in his song Guilty Conscience, in which Dee Barnes occurs. In Sentence 2, the use of the word \\"occurs\\" implies that Dee Barnes is mentioned or somehow involved in the song, but it is not clear in what capacity. To \\"occur\\" in a track could mean various things, such as being mentioned in the lyrics, alluded to through musical motifs, or connected to the work in a different way (e.g., as a part of the song's inspiration or backstory).  The difference between being \\"featured\\" and merely \\"occurring\\" in a track could be significant depending on the context. In Sentence 1, the reader understands that Dee Barnes collaborates on the song, while in Sentence 2, it is not explicitly stated what role Dee Barnes plays in Guilty Conscience. In summary, the two sentences convey related information, as both mention Eminem, Dr. Dre, Guilty Conscience, and Dee Barnes. However, they do not convey the same information due to the difference in the language used to describe Dee Barnes' involvement in the song. Sentence 1 implies a more significant and active role for Dee Barnes, whereas Sentence 2 leaves her contribution or association with the track ambiguous."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Additionally, the paragraph mentions that Mark Twain is incorporated as a significant character within Shohola Falls, and the fictional reality aligns with the historical one. Based on the information provided, we can make an informed assumption that the hypothesis suggesting \\"Thomas Blankenship knew Mark Twain\\" is likely to be true. The fact that Thomas Blankenship is cited as the individual Mark Twain based Huck Finn upon implies that Twain must have known or interacted with Blankenship in some capacity during his life. Furthermore, the alignment of the fictional reality in Shohola Falls with the historical reality further supports the possibility of a connection between Thomas Blankenship and Mark Twain. It is important to clarify that the paragraph itself does not directly or indisputably confirm that Thomas Blankenship knew Mark Twain, but the logical inferences drawn from the provided information point toward the likelihood of this hypothesis being true.

Step 1: Getting the group together The first step was to get the three of us together, which Robinson did. She recognized our individual talents and believed that we would make a great team. We developed a camaraderie and were eager to work together to create something special in the music industry. Step 2: Writing the song The next step was to write the lyrics and music for \\"Rapper's Delight.\\" We wanted to showcase our unique style and bring a new sound to the world of music. The song was a mix of catchy verses, each of us taking turns to share our rapping talents. The lyrics were filled with fun expressions and innovative rhymes that instantly captured the attention of listeners. Step 3: Recording the song With the song written, we entered the recording studio to lay down the track. Being new to the recording process, we were both excited and nervous. We worked diligently to ensure the track sounded perfect, making several takes if needed. Our chemistry in the studio translated to the energetic and infectious vibe of the track. Step 4: Release and promotion Once the song was recorded, Robinson released it through her label, Sugar Hill Records. We promoted the single through performing live shows, radio interviews, and spreading the word about our unique sound. The people in the industry and the general public took notice, leading to the growing popularity of our single. Step 5: Achieving mainstream success \\"Rapper's Delight\\" took off, becoming the first rap song to reach the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard charts. Our hard work and determination along with Robinson's vision and belief in us had paid off. We had truly made history by bringing hip-hop to the forefront of mainstream music and creating a pathway for future generations of hip-hop artists. In conclusion, the success of \\"Rapper's Delight\\" and the Sugarhill Gang can be attributed to the combined efforts of all the members, the faith and guidance of Sylvia Robinson, and our drive to make a mark in the world of music. We will forever be grateful for the legacy left by Big Bank Hank, and his contributions to the genre that has now become a global phenomenon. Our journey together was one filled with groundbreaking achievements, and the history we created will always be remembered and cherished."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead, it is clear that the Abbey of St. Colm is currently in a state of ruin.  The Abbey of St. Colm was founded in the 12th century and named for St. Columba, a key figure in the introduction of Christianity to western Scotland 600 years earlier. Over the centuries, the Abbey might have experienced several events – natural disasters, conflict, or general neglect – that contributed to its current state of ruin. To further explore the history of the Abbey of St. Colm, one would need to look at historical records, documents, and other sources of information that could narrate the state of the abbey throughout history. By analyzing such information, one might discover periods when the structure was well-maintained, and conversely, periods of decay and disrepair. This will also provide a better understanding of the factors that contributed to the deterioration of the abbey. However, even with this additional information, it is important to note that describing the abbey as always being in excellent repair would be an exaggeration. Buildings, especially those dating back to the 12th century, typically require constant maintenance to sustain their structural integrity and a pristine appearance.  In conclusion, considering that the Abbey of St. Colm is now in ruins, it would be incorrect to assume that it has always been in excellent repair. Further research into the history of the abbey by analyzing historical records, documents, and other sources would provide more insight into the varying conditions of the abbey throughout various periods. Even so, due to the challenges of maintaining the structure over such an extended time, it is reasonable to believe that the Abbey of St. Colm might not have been in excellent repair during its entire existence."},{"instruction":"Chris is working in a lab that handles radioactive materials.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the former prime minister who did not provide financial support for the leader of the Nimrod Expedition? is inside the article: Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\\"a bit of a floating gent\\". By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","output":"The last name of the former prime minister who did not provide financial support for the leader of the Nimrod Expedition is Rosebery. The section of your article that answers the question is where it mentions \\"the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery\\" and continues by describing how he did not provide assistance or support. The article states that Rosebery was blunt in his refusal to support, clearly expressing his disinterest in the Poles and presumably this includes their expeditions. Therefore, the full name of this former Prime Minister is Lord Rosebery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Gigi [ZiZi] is a 1958 American musical-romance film directed by Vincente Minnelli processed using MGM's Metrocolor. The screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner is based on the 1944 novella of the same name by Colette. The film features songs with lyrics by Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe, arranged and conducted by Andre Previn. In 1991, Gigi was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". In late April, Freed and Minnelli and their respective entourages arrived in Paris. The weather had become unseasonably hot, and working in unair-conditioned hotel rooms was uncomfortable. Minnelli began scouting locations while Freed and Lerner discussed the still incomplete script. Lerner had taken liberties with Colette's novella; the character of Honore, nonexistent in the original book and very minor in the Loos play, was now a major figure. Gigi's mother, originally a significant character, was reduced to a few lines of dialogue delivered off-screen. Lerner also expanded the focus on Gigi's relationship with her grandmother.  By mid-July, the composers had completed most of the score, but still were missing the title tune. Loewe was at the piano while Lerner was indisposed in the bathroom, and when the former began playing a melody the latter liked, he later recalled he jumped up, \\"[his] trousers still clinging to [his] ankles, and made his way to the living room. 'Play that again,' he said. And that melody ended up being the title song for Gigi.\\"  In September, the cast and crew flew to California, where several interior scenes were filmed, among them the entire scene in Maxim's, which included a musical number by Jourdan. Lerner was unhappy with the look of the scene as it had been shot by Minnelli, and at considerable expense, the restaurant was recreated on a soundstage and the scene was reshot by director Charles Walters, since Minnelli was overseas working on a new project.  The film title design uses the artwork of Sem's work from the Belle Epoque. Where did they film?","output":"Gigi (1958) was filmed at various locations, primarily in Paris, France, and at MGM Studios in Culver City, California. In Paris, some of the most iconic and recognizable locations that were used for filming included the Bois de Boulogne, Avenue Montaigne, Château-Brissac, Place de la Concord, and the Palais de la Civilisation du Travail, among others. In addition to these outdoor locations, many of Paris' exquisite streets and neighborhoods provided the perfect backdrop for the romantic story. After the cast and crew completed filming in Paris, they flew to California in September to shoot several important interior scenes. These were filmed at the MGM Studios in Culver City. For example, the entire scene in Maxim's, a famous Parisian restaurant, was recreated on a soundstage at the studios. The initial version of this scene, which was directed by Vincente Minnelli, was reshot by director Charles Walters on the soundstage, as Alan Jay Lerner was not satisfied with its initial look. In summary, Gigi was filmed at a combination of beautiful, historical locations in Paris and at the MGM Studios in California, which allowed the film to capture the charm and grandeur of its Parisian setting while maintaining a high level of production control in the studio environment. This combination helped create a visually stunning and memorable film that has stood the test of time."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: This will draw attention away from your cheeks and pull it towards yours lips instead. To contour your lips, apply some highlighting powder along the top of your cupid's bow and a dab of bronzer just below your bottom lip. Blend well and apply some bright lipstick. These will make your head appear longer than it is wide, giving the illusion of a thinner face. Even a baseball cap that is higher than normal can help make your face look longer. When choosing earrings, go for ones that go past your jaw; this will draw attention away from the sides of your face. The more angular the earring is, the more will contrast with your face shape, making it appear thinner. If you are wearing your hair in an up-do, you can frame your face by wearing some long earrings. This will draw the eye downward, pulling attention away from the width of your face. Long necklaces will also give the illusion that your neck and face are longer. Necklaces that are too short will pull the eye upward and draw too much attention to the width of your face. If you do wear short necklaces and chokers, remember to frame your face by wearing your hair down or lettings your long bangs hang by your cheeks. Try to find something with a rectangular shape, but that still has rounded corners. Glasses that are wider than your face will make your face appear more narrow. Shirts with a longer neckline will make your neck (and thus your face) appear longer. High-collared shirts, on the other hand, will make your neck appear shorter and pull attention upwards towards your jaw and the width of your face.

This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person who Mattheson claims was trimmed into other fashions by \\"the lofty schooling of opera\\"?

The word \\"radiant\\" is commonly associated with brightness, light, warmth, and happiness. It is often used to describe someone or something that is glowing, full of energy, or emitting a positive aura. In various contexts, it could refer to an individual's radiant personality, their glowing complexion, or even a beautifully lit environment. In the realm of emotions and feelings, the term \\"radiant\\" is particularly connected to positivity as it can imply a sense of joyfulness, cheerfulness, or optimism. People who are described as radiant are often seen as being optimistic and having a way of making others feel uplifted as well. The phrase could also signify a level of confidence, self-assurance, and inner contentment that is apparent in someone's demeanor, body language, or facial expressions. To further illustrate why \\"radiant\\" would be considered a positive sentiment, consider the following examples: 1. \\"Her radiant smile lit up the room, making everyone feel welcome and at ease.\\" 2. \\"The garden looked particularly radiant that morning with the sun shining brightly on the colorful flowers.\\" 3. \\"Despite the challenges she faced, her radiant positivity remained unwavering and inspired those around her.\\" In each of these examples, the word \\"radiant\\" conveys a positive quality, whether it's related to a person's disposition, the aesthetics of a place, or someone's ability to influence others positively.

The other directly attested Old Iranian dialects are the two forms of Avestan, which take their name from their use in the Avesta, the liturgical texts of indigenous Iranian religion that now goes by the name of Zoroastrianism but in the Avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena (later: behdin). The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as \\"Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan\\", and \\"Younger Avestan\\". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its \\"old\\" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage. Unlike Old Persian, which has Middle Persian as its known successor, Avestan has no clearly identifiable Middle Iranian stage (the effect of Middle Iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes). Why did old Persian retained its old characteristics long after the old Iranian languages (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Old Persian, along with Avestan, is an ancient Iranian language. As you mentioned, Avestan retained its old characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had evolved into their Middle Iranian stages. However, this phenomenon can be better understood in light of linguistic, historical, and cultural factors that influenced the preservation of these dialects. First, it is essential to note that Avestan was employed specifically as a liturgical and sacred language in the religious context of Zoroastrianism. Avestan's religious significance played a significant role in preserving its archaic features. Just like other religious languages (such as Latin in the Roman Catholic Church and Sanskrit in Hinduism), Avestan was used for rituals, hymns, and religious texts, which demanded a sense of stability and continuity in language usage. Moreover, Old Avestan and Younger Avestan were highly conservative in their nature, primarily due to their function in religious scriptures. Since the religious texts were considered to be sacred and divine, preserving these texts in their original form was seen as crucial to maintaining the intended meaning and symbolism. Thus, any significant alterations in language might have been discouraged and could have been regarded as disrespect or as introducingpotential inaccuracies, leading to misinterpretation. Furthermore, religious languages tend to be somewhat disconnected from everyday vernacular usage, which usually experiences greater linguistic change over time. Since the main function of Avestan was in religious contexts rather than daily conversations, the influence of day-to-day linguistic changes was relatively limited. The more isolated a language or dialect, the less likely it is to undergo substantial changes. Lastly, the historical and geographical context also played a role in Avestan's retention of archaic features. The Old Avestan dialect was from a different geographic region than Younger Avestan, and Old Persian. This regional isolation might have played a role in preserving more archaic language features in Old Avestan. In summary, several factors contributed to Avestan retaining its old characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had evolved into their Middle Iranian stages. The religious significance and role of Avestan as part of Zoroastrianism, its conservative nature, the relative isolation from everyday language usage, and historical and geographical influences all played a part in preserving the archaic features of Avestan."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Doctors are now dealing with the aftershocks. Just how dangerous is this exposure? That's the question physicians are being asked by parents who find a lead-polluted Elmo, of Dora.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Who did Batman persuade to hold himself responsible for the killing spree? Gordon The answer is:","output":"To build a movie plot around the given question, we need to consider the key elements and characters involved. Title: The Dark Knight's Dilemma Main Characters: 1. Batman (Bruce Wayne) 2. Commissioner Gordon 3. The Antagonist (The Chaos Bringer) 4. Secondary Characters (Alfred, Lucius Fox, Gotham City Police Department officers) Plot Overview: Act 1 (Introduction): - The movie starts with a series of mysterious killings taking place in Gotham City. These killings seem to be random but are connected by a single message left behind: \\"Chaos is Order.\\" - Batman and Commissioner Gordon are desperate to put an end to this killing spree. They work closely together, sharing information and resources to find the mastermind or group responsible for these murders. - While investigating, Batman realizes that the person behind the killings is an enigmatic and cunning mastermind, with the code name \\"The Chaos Bringer.\\" This antagonist thrives on causing chaos, fear, and uncertainty within the city. Act 2 (Conflict): - Batman and Gordon continue to investigate the killings, but they are struggling to find solid leads. The Chaos Bringer is always one step ahead of them, leaving them frustrated and demoralized. - Meanwhile, the public starts to lose faith in Batman and the Gotham City Police Department's ability to catch the killer. They begin to see Batman as a harbinger of chaos, rather than a symbol of hope and justice. - In order to restore public faith and end the killing spree, Batman devises a plan with Gordon that will hold one person responsible for the murders. Act 3 (Resolution): - Batman persuades Commissioner Gordon to hold himself responsible for the killing spree. He believes that by doing this, the public's focus will shift, and they will rally behind the police department once again. - Reluctantly, Gordon agrees to take the fall and claims responsibility for not catching The Chaos Bringer sooner. This causes Gordon to be placed on temporary leave, giving Batman time and freedom to chase down The Chaos Bringer without hindrance. - Batman ultimately cracks the case and apprehends The Chaos Bringer. With the real perpetrator now in custody, Gordon's name is cleared, and he resumes his position as the Commissioner. - Batman's persuasive move reminds the citizens of Gotham City that sometimes, sacrifices must be made for the greater good. The public's faith in Batman and the police department is restored, and they celebrate a city that has overcome the brink of chaos. In conclusion, Batman persuaded Commissioner Gordon to hold himself responsible for the killing spree in order to shift the public's focus and give them an opportunity to take down the real mastermind, The Chaos Bringer. This not only restored public faith but also strengthened the bond between Batman and Gordon, who share the common goal of protecting Gotham City and maintaining justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Bumble Bee Foods has agreed to a workplace settlement that is being called the largest of its kind in Los Angeles County history.      The settlement agreement requires Bumble Bee Foods LLC to pay 6 million for willfully violating worker safety rules, the largest known payout in a California criminal prosecution of workplace safety violations involving a single victim, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement.      “This is the worst circumstances of death I have ever, ever witnessed,” said Deputy District Attorney Hoon Chun, who noted that he had tried more than 40 murder cases over two decades. “I think any person would prefer to be — if they had to die some way — would prefer to be shot or stabbed than to be slowly cooked in an oven. “      The canned tuna company and two of its Santa Fe Springs plant managers were charged in April in the 2012 death of 62-year-old Jose Melena, who was cooked to death after becoming trapped inside a steam oven.      The settlement calls for Bumble Bee Foods to pay 3 million to replace the tuna ovens with new, automated ovens that will not require workers to step inside and 1.5 million in restitution to Melena’s family.      The settlement does not prevent the Melena family from also suing the company or receiving workers’ compensation funds, Hoon said.      “Certainly, nothing will bring back our dad, and our mom will not have her husband back, but much can be done to ensure this terrible accident does not happen again,” the family said in a statement.      The company will also pay 750,000 into the District Attorney’s environmental enforcement fund and another 750,000 toward penalties and court costs.      Bumble Bee and two plant managers – Saul Florez, the former safety manager, and Angel Rodriguez, the company’s director of plant operations – had been scheduled for a hearing in court Wednesday, the day the settlement was announced.      Melena had been loading pallets of canned tuna into 35-foot-long ovens at the company’s Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012.      When a supervisor noticed him missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health.      His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker was turned off, cooled and opened.      The agreement also requires Bumble Bee to implement enhanced safety measures, such as installing video cameras at their ovens to ensure safety compliance, providing training to managers and workers about safety rules and conducting safety audits of their plant equipment.      The District Attorney’s Office said the sentence will not be formally imposed for 18 months. If at that time Bumble Bee has been found to comply with the terms of the settlement, the company will be allowed to plead guilty to willful failure to implement and maintain an effective safety program, a misdemeanor.      Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, agreed to do 320 hours of community service, pay about 11,400 in fines and penalty assessments and take classes on lockout tagout and confined space rules. If found to be in compliance, Rodriguez will be allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor in 18 months, according to the District Attorney’s Office.      Florez, 42, of Whittier, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a felony count of willfully violating lockout tagout rules and proximately causing Melena’s death and was sentenced to three years of formal probation. Florez was also ordered to complete 30 days of community labor, take classes on lockout tagout and confined spaces, and pay 19,000 in fines and penalty assessments. Florez will be eligible to have his felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor if found in compliance with the terms and conditions of his plea agreement in 18 months, District Attorney’s officials said.      The two men had faced up to three years in prison and fines up to 250,000. The company had faced fines up to 1.5 million.      The San Diego-based company is appealing 74,000 in fines by the state’s occupational safety agency for failing to properly assess employee danger.      “We will never forget the unfathomable loss of our colleague Jose Melena and we are committed to ensuring that employee safety remains a top priority at all our facilities,” the company said in a statement.      Workplace violation prosecutions are fairly uncommon — even after deaths. Of 189 fatality investigations opened by the state in 2013, only 29 were referred to prosecutors and charges were only filed in 14 cases that year, according to state records.

(Photo by Melissa Masatani)      LOS ANGELES >> Bumble Bee Foods will pay 6 million in fines and restitution including 1.5 million to the family of the employee who was burned to death inside an industrial oven at the company’s Santa Fe Springs plant in October 2012, officials said Wednesday.      Los Angeles County district attorney’s officials called the settlement the largest known workplace violation agreement ever.      Bumble Bee Foods LLC, the company’s former safety manager Saul Florez, 42, of Whittier, and current director of plant operations Angel Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, were charged in April with three felony counts each in connection with the October 2012 death of 62-year-old employee Jose Melena of Wilmington.      As part of the settlement, the company will pay 3 million to replace the plant’s outdated tuna ovens with automated ovens; pay 1.5 million in restitution to Melena’s family on top of any other compensation or payment; 750,000 to the district attorney’s environmental enforcement fund for investigating and prosecuting workplace safety; and 750,000 in fines and court fees. Rodriguez will serve 320 hours of community service, take two safety classes and pay 11,400 in fines and fees.      After 18 months, both parties can plead guilty to a single misdemeanor count of willfully failing to maintain an effective safety program, according to Judge Michael E. Pastor at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in Los Angeles.      Florez pleaded guilty to one count of willfully violating workplace safety rules causing a death and will serve three years felony probation, serve 30 days of community labor, take two safety classes and pay around 19,000 in penalties and fees. If Florez completes the terms of the plea, he can petition after 18 months to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and serve unsupervised probation.      “As far as we know in California, this is the first time that a safety manager has been convicted of a felony,” Consumer Protection Division Assistant Head Deputy Hoon Chun said. “And we hope that the message gets out there that you can’t just be a safety manager in name only.”      Florez and Rodriguez faced a maximum sentence of three years in state prison and/or a 250,000 fine. The San Diego-based company faced a 1.5 million maximum fine.      Melena’s family members, one of whom sat silently watching the proceedings, did not want to comment, Chun said. The family had retained a civil attorney, he said, but did not elaborate.      The company called the 2012 incident a tragic accident.      “While this resolution will help bring closure with the District Attorney’s Office, we will never forget the unfathomable loss of our colleague Jose Melena and we are committed to ensuring that employee safety remains a top priority at all our facilities,” according to a statement sent on behalf of Bumble Bee Foods.      Advertisement      Melena, a father of six and a six-year employee of the plant at 13100 Arctic Circle Drive, had been assigned to load a particular oven on the morning of his death and entered one of the 54-inch-by-36-foot industrial ovens to make a repair or an adjustment to a chain, according to the state safety regulator’s citation about the Oct. 11, 2012, incident.      He left the pallet jack used to load tuna outside the oven and another employee assumed that Melena was in the bathroom, then started using the jack, the citation said.      Employees began searching for Melena after a supervisor noticed the worker’s car was still in the parking lot and Melena’s body was found two hours later.      A Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner’s autopsy determined Melena died from burns and an investigation was launched by the California Occupational Safety & Health Administration and the District Attorney’s Office.      The Cal/OSHA investigation found that previous serious injuries at the tuna canning plant had gone unreported to the state agency. An employee had a finger amputated after it was caught in a chute on Oct. 23, 2011, and another employee suffered a fractured skull after falling from a forklift on June 28, 2011, Cal-OSHA officials previously said. ||||| The parents of a South Carolina teenager who was killed last month by police demanded Wednesday that law enforcement give them more information about their son's final moments.      \\"We just want answers.

Melena's grisly death in a 270-degree oven three years ago led to a 6 million agreement by Bumble Bee on Wednesday to settle criminal charges in what Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey said was the largest payout in a California workplace-violation death. The sum was four times greater than the maximum fines the company faced.      \\"This is the worst circumstances of death I have ever, ever witnessed,\\" said Deputy District Attorney Hoon Chun, who noted that he had tried more than 40 murder cases over two decades. \\"I think any person would prefer to be — if they had to die some way — would prefer to be shot or stabbed than to be slowly cooked in an oven. \\"      Melena, 62, perished at the seafood company's Santa Fe Springs plant after a co-worker mistakenly believed he was in the bathroom and loaded six tons of canned tuna into the oven after he had stepped inside.      The company didn't have safety procedures that would have required the equipment be turned off with an employee inside or provide an escape route or a spotter to keep watch with a worker in a confined space, Hoon said.      In a rare prosecution of a workplace fatality, Bumble Bee, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.      Each party reached a different plea agreement Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court.      Bumble Bee agreed to plead guilty in January 2017 to a misdemeanor of having willfully failed to provide an effective safety program. First, however, it must complete several safety measures that include spending 3 million to upgrade ovens so workers can't get trapped inside and providing worker training.      Florez, 42, of Whittier was sentenced to three years of probation and will face fines and penalties of about 19,000 after pleading guilty to a single felony count of violating a workplace safety rule that caused a death.      Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, agreed to plead guilty in 18 months to a misdemeanor and pay about 11,000 after he completes 320 hours of community service and worker safety courses.      The two men had faced up to three years in prison and fines up to 250,000. The company had faced fines up to 1.5 million.      Melena's family will receive 1.5 million under the settlement. It does not prevent them from also suing the company or receiving workers' compensation funds, Hoon said.      \\"Certainly, nothing will bring back our dad, and our mom will not have her husband back, but much can be done to ensure this terrible accident does not happen again,\\" the family said in a statement.

As an owner of EVERY DMB cd available, I appreciate the variety of this CD most. From the great guitar riffs of I Did It, to the slow paced Sleep To Dream Her, the quality of DMB's music hasn't changed at all. If you read the article about Dave Matthews in Rolling Stone (in stores now) you will find that this CD has \\"his best lyrics yet\\". Is the review positive or negative? The answer is:","output":"The review is clearly positive. The reviewer expresses enthusiasm and appreciation for the new album \\"Everyday\\" by Dave Matthews Band (DMB) and describes it as yet another \\"smash album.\\" As an owner of all DMB CDs, the reviewer celebrates the variety of tracks featured on the album, mentioning the great guitar riffs in \\"I Did It\\" and the slow pace of \\"Sleep To Dream Her.\\" The review also highlights the consistent quality of DMB's music, indicating that it has not diminished over time. Furthermore, the reviewer cites an article from Rolling Stone, a reputed music publication that claims the album consists of \\"his best lyrics yet.\\" This statement adds credibility to the reviewer's positive assessment of the album. The mention of accolades from a well-respected magazine encourages other potential listeners to trust the reviewer's opinion and give the album a chance. In summary, the review is distinctly positive, praising the band's latest endeavor, \\"Everyday,\\" and applauding the diverse tracklist and high-quality lyrics. The reviewer's devotion as a longtime fan and the endorsement from Rolling Stone only serve to strengthen the affirmative nature of the review, which is likely to influence others to view the album in the same favorable light."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

Spacemen 3 were an English alternative rock band, formed in 1982 in Rugby, Warwickshire by Peter Kember and Jason Pierce. Their music is known for its brand of \\"minimalistic psychedelia\\". Spacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and going on to have greater success towards the end of the decade. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. Most members of Spacemen 3 have continued to produce music and record either collaboratively or in solo projects. Peter Kember (alias 'Sonic Boom') has had a solo career releasing music under the monikers Spectrum and E.A.R., and has also done production work for MGMT, Panda Bear, Dean & Britta and The Flowers of Hell. Jason Pierce (alias 'J. Spaceman') remains the leader and creative force, and only constant member, of the alternative band Spiritualized who have achieved significant critical acclaim and commercial success. Both Kember and Pierce continue to perform some Spacemen 3 songs live (e.g. \\"Transparent Radiation\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"Suicide\\", \\"Set Me Free\\", \\"Che\\" and \\"Let Me Down Gently\\" [Kember]; and \\"Take Me to the Other Side\\", \\"Walkin' with Jesus\\", \\"Amen\\" and \\"Lord Can You Hear Me?\\" [Pierce]).  Will Carruthers, Jonny Mattock and Mark Refoy formed Spiritualized with Pierce in early 1990. Carruthers left the band after the first album in 1992; followed by Mattock and Refoy in 1994. Refoy then fronted Slipstream who released two albums. Refoy played guitar for the Pet Shop Boys on their live tour in 2007. Will Carruthers took a hiatus from the music industry after leaving Spiritualized; but subsequently has worked with Kember, recorded two solo albums as Freelovebabies, and has most recently toured with The Brian Jonestown Massacre. Carruthers, Mattock and Refoy have also collaborated on projects together.  After leaving Spacemen 3 in 1988, both Pete Bain and Stewart Roswell ('Rosco') joined the neo-psychedelic band Darkside who released several albums. Following the end of Darkside, Bain formed 'Alphastone', and has assisted Kember on some of the latter's solo projects. As of 2010 he provides vocals and guitar in 'The Urgz'. Stewart Roswell (alias Sterling Roswell) released a solo album, The Psychedelic Ubik, in 2004.  In the early 1990s, early Spacemen 3 drummer Natty Brooker played bass under the alias 'Mr Ugly' in Garage rock band 'The Guaranteed Ugly', with Gavin Wissen. They released two albums.

Context: Monastic reform inspired change in the secular church. The ideals that it was based upon were brought to the papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049–1054), and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage in the creation of a papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.

Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, while Gold town did.  But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  What is an answer for this question: Which town caused fewer decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water? A:","output":"Given the information provided and considering the background, it becomes clear which town caused fewer decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water.

The paragraph describes a scenario where a sender, using a spoofed email address, is attempting to extort money from the recipient. The sender does this by claiming to have an associate who had planted a bomb in the recipient's building. Since the sender is mentioning the involvement of an associate, it implies the presence of at least two people working together in this scheme, which means the sender is not acting alone. The specific instances in the paragraph that support this conclusion include: 1. The mention of an \\"associate\\" - This signals collaboration or partnership between two or more people. In this case, it indicates the sender has someone else working with them to plant the bomb. 2.

The sender states that the only way to stop \\"him\\" from setting the bomb off is by making the ransom payment, clearly differentiating the roles of both individuals.

He spoke of the shock and disbelief upon receiving the haunting news that his daughter Kayla, who was once a beacon of light and hope for many, had been killed. He recounted how the family received little information from the authorities during Kayla's 18 months of harrowing ISIS captivity, escalating their profound fear and helplessness. Carl shared how they lived moment by moment, always hoping and praying for a miracle that would bring their beloved daughter back home. Marsha Mueller, her voice trembling with emotion, joined her husband in narrating their heartbreaking story. She said the family struggled to come to terms with the abrupt end of a life bristling with promise and humanitarian work. Kayla, she said, had an unwavering commitment to alleviate human suffering, especially among Syrian refugees. Marsha told Savannah Guthrie how proud they were of their daughter's courage and her strong dedication to provide solace to suffering humanity. Their son Eric, too, spoke about his sister with a mix of immense sorrow and quiet pride. He expressed his hopes that his sister's sacrifice and story would invigorate others to research and understand the plight of Syrian refugees - the people his sister loved and served with unwavering dedication and compassion. Eric said, \\"My hope is that out of the dark tragedy of Kayla's death, light will emerge in the form of increased understanding and awareness about what is happening in Syria. She would have wanted us to continue her work and not just mourn her loss.\\" During the emotional interview, Carl Mueller revealed how the family was initially hopeful when Kayla was captured by ISIS in 2013. They clung on to the hope that Kayla would be released, despite the notoriously ruthless reputation of her captors. However, as weeks turned into months and then into a year and a half, they could not shake off the growing dread about her fate. The Mueller family conveyed their pain, strength, and courage during the heartbreaking interview. Despite their profound loss, they emphasized their daughter's life's work, her dedication to assisting the needy and less fortunate, and her valiant efforts to highlight the suffering of Syrian refugees. Their interview served as a sobering reminder of the great human cost of conflicts, a testament to the enduring empathy of service workers like Kayla, and a resounding appeal to the world to continue her mission of offering hope and assistance to the world's most desperate and downtrodden.  Besides paying tribute to their late daughter, the Muellers seek to ensure that Kayla's legacy continues to resonate — advocating for a greater understanding of the Syrian crisis, promoting aid and assistance to those stricken by war, and echoing their daughter's courageous cry for compassion for the less fortunate. Their heart-wrenching story shows their resolve in trying to find some semblance of meaning in the tragic loss of their daughter by advocating for the causes she fiercely believed in."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence from the Quran in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.

The possibilities of creating stunning designs are endless - from traditional spiral patterns to modern, random ones. In this article, we will explore four different tie-dyeing techniques that will help you achieve the desired pattern on your fabric. 1. Traditional Swirl Pattern The traditional swirl pattern, also known as the spiral pattern, is one of the most popular and easy-to-make designs in the world of tie-dyeing. To create this striking pattern, follow these steps: Step 1: Lay your fabric flat on a work surface. Step 2: Decide on the center point of your spiral. This will be the point where the swirl pattern starts and gradually extends outward. Step 3: Using your fingers, begin twisting the fabric around the center point, gradually moving outward until you have a spiral-shaped bundle of fabric. Step 4: Secure the twisted fabric using three or four rubber bands, ensuring each section is held together properly. Step 5: Apply the dye to the fabric by section, varying the colors as desired. Flip the fabric and repeat the dyeing process on the other side. By following these simple steps, you'll be able to create an eye-catching, traditional swirl pattern on your fabric. 2. Striped Pattern A striped pattern is a versatile design that can be used to create a simple or complex pattern depending on your preference. To achieve this: Step 1: Lay your fabric flat on the work surface. Step 2: Fold your fabric accordion-style, either horizontally or vertically depending on the direction of the stripes you want. Step 3: Wrap rubber bands evenly spaced along the folded fabric. Step 4: Apply the dye to the fabric, being careful to keep the color application within the sections created by the rubber bands. Step 5: Flip the fabric and repeat the dyeing process on the other side. With these steps, you can create a visually appealing striped pattern on your fabric. 3. Mini Starbursts Pattern The mini starbursts pattern is a creative option that adds small bursts of color to your fabric. To create this design: Step 1: Lay your fabric flat on the work surface. Step 2: Identify areas on the fabric where you want the starbursts to appear. Step 3: Pinch and gather small tufts of fabric in those areas. Step 4: Secure the tufts in place using rubber bands. Step 5: Apply the dye to the fabric, ensuring the tufts also receive color. Step 6: Flip the fabric and repeat the dyeing process on the other side. This technique will give your fabric a fun and vibrant touch with its mini starburst design. 4. Random Pattern For those who prefer a more abstract and unconventional design, a random pattern is an excellent choice. To create this pattern: Step 1: Crumple the fabric randomly, ensuring a variety of creases and folds. Step 2: Tie the fabric using rubber bands to secure its crumpled shape. Step 3: Apply the dye to the fabric, ensuring the crevices and surfaces are covered in color. Step 4: Flip the fabric and repeat the dyeing process on the other side. This technique will result in a truly unique and unexpected pattern on your fabric. Conclusion: Tie-dyeing offers endless possibilities when it comes to creating custom fabric designs. By using the techniques above, you can easily achieve stunning patterns ranging from traditional swirls to modern random patterns. Go ahead and unleash your creativity by experimenting with these tie-dyeing techniques!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve this math problem Solve 406*l + 320*l - 3115 = 281*l for l.","output":"Alright, little buddy! Let's solve this math problem step by step. We have to find the value of 'l' in this equation: 406 * l + 320 * l - 3115 = 281 * l First, let's add the 'l' terms on the left side of the equation together: (406 * l) + (320 * l) = 406l + 320l Now, if we add these together like we would with numbers, we get: 726l - 3115 = 281l Now, let's move the '281l' from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do this, we will subtract '281l' from both sides: 726l - 281l - 3115 = 0 This gives us: 445l - 3115 = 0 Now, let's move the '-3115' to the right side of the equation by adding '3115' to both sides: 445l = 3115 Now, to find the value of 'l', we need to divide both sides of the equation by '445': l = 3115 ÷ 445 When we do the division, we find that: l = 7 So, the value of 'l' is 7 in this math problem.

Article: Some people say that today, reading is not as important as it was. These days we have photographs, films, radio and television. Why read a description of something when you can look at a photograph? Why read a newspaper when the latest news is brought to us every hour on radio and TV? Photography was certainly a wonderful invention. Photographs can give a very clear idea of places and of people that we have never seen. An encyclopedia   , for example, is always better when it has good illustrations. But we also need words to explain the photographs and drawings. A photograph of an elephant may give us a very good idea of what an elephant looks like, but it tells us nothing about the different sorts of elephants there are and where they are found, their exact size and weight, how they can be useful to man and so on. In the same way, a good film has action, movement, color, and maybe music. These are things we do not find on the printed page. But reading a novel has certain advantages over watching even an excellent feature film. Reading a novel requires imagination. Each of us imagines a story differently. Watching news on television can certainly be exciting. But we need newspapers as well. Some important news stories happen when there are no cameras around. More importantly, a newspaper does not just report the news. It explains why something has been happening. It also contains interesting articles on different subjects.

He qualified himself for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing .  - BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed.  The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old.  - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom.  - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation. BMX began when young cyclists appropriated motocross tracks for fun, racing and stunts, eventually evolving specialized BMX bikes and competitions.  - Freestyle BMX is bicycle motocross stunt riding on BMX bikes. It is an extreme sport descended from BMX racing that consists of five disciplines: street, park, vert, trails, and flatland.  - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials.

Q:U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened tariffs on an additional 100 billion worth of Chinese goods, on top of the 50 billion in import taxes he already has proposed against Beijing. Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war. For decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property. Last month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on 50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied. China gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal. Beijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles.  In other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between 225 billion and 600 billion every year. That rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \\"We can't afford to give up our technology,\\" Kudlow said Friday. \\"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\\" The Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently...

Article: Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated  since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well. Question: What type of writing does this passage belong to?

Given the question: Question: Learning languages is difficult.  Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?,  Choices:  - better communication - overthinking - frustration - misunderstandings - headaches  The rationale to choose \\"frustration\\" as the answer is that: The answer is:","output":"frustration. The rationale for choosing \\"frustration\\" as the answer in this context is multifaceted. Learning languages is an incredibly complex process, and even in an immersive environment, mistakes are bound to happen. These mistakes can lead to misinterpretations, which can cause several negative consequences, but frustration is the most likely in this scenario. Here's why: 1. Emotional Reaction: Frustration is a common emotional reaction to challenging and difficult situations. When faced with a significant challenge, like learning a new language, it is natural to feel frustrated when things don't go as smoothly as planned. Making mistakes and experiencing misinterpretations can lead to frustration as learners may feel that their progress is hindered or that they are unable to effectively communicate their thoughts and ideas. 2. Persistence of Mistakes: As language learners spend more time in an immersive environment, they may continue to make mistakes. This can be frustrating because it may feel like they are not improving or are stuck at a certain level of proficiency. The constant presence of mistakes and misinterpretations may compound the negative emotions and lead to frustration becoming the most prominent feeling. 3. Negative Feedback Loop: The presence of misinterpretations can create a negative feedback loop. When a learner makes a mistake, it may cause misinterpretation, which leads to discomfort and frustration. This frustration can then make it harder to focus, leading to even more mistakes and misinterpretations in communication. This cycle can reinforce the feelings of frustration, causing it to become the dominant emotion in relation to language learning. 4. Impact on Confidence: Frustration can also impact a learner's confidence in their language skills. The more frustration they feel as a result of their mistakes and misinterpretations, the less confident they may become. This lack of confidence may make it difficult for language learners to attempt new forms of communication, or to continue pushing themselves to improve and grow in their language abilities. While overthinking, misunderstandings, and headaches may also be consequences of mistakes and misinterpretations in language learning, frustration stands out as the answer in this context. This is because frustration is an emotional response that often arises in challenging situations and is closely tied to the negative feedback loop language learners experience when making mistakes. Additionally, frustration has significant implications for a learner's confidence and their determination to improve and persevere in their language studies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was said to be making the church a popular meeting place on campus for undergraduates? ?  Stanford did not employ a full-time professor in religion until 1951 and did not establish a religious studies department until 1973, later than most other universities in the U.S.  Earlier courses in religion were largely offered by the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church.  David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching New Testament Greek and Bible classes.  Gardner's successor, D. Elton Trueblood, whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the philosophy of religion.  In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members.  By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion.  By the mid-1960s, the religious studies program at Stanford was enjoying \\"enormous success\\".In the 1960s, the study of religion at Stanford began to focus more on social and ethical issues like race and the Vietnam War.  Leading this focus was Stanford Memorial Church Dean of the Chapel and Professor of Religion B. Davie Napier, who was \\"a powerful critic of U.S. policy in Vietnam\\".  Napier, along with Stanford professors Michael Novak and Robert McAfee Brown, who had previously been faculty members of seminaries, were the subject of a Time Magazine article in 1966, describing \\"the renaissance of faith and learning at Stanford\\".  Students crowded into the church to hear anti-war speeches by them, as well as by \\"notables\\" such as Linus Pauling and William Sloan Coffin.  Harvey credited Napier for making the church a popular meeting place on campus for undergraduates and for turning it into \\"Christian theater—the introduction of jazz and other types of experimental worship as well as provocative preaching\\".Stanford University was the first...

Q: The greatest Bears player since their iconic Super Bowl XX team more than three decades ago received the highest NFL honor Saturday when  Brian Urlacher  was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Urlacher  39  becomes the 28th Hall of Famer to represent the Bears for all or the primary portion of their careers  the most in the NFL  and the first since defensive end Richard Dent was inducted in 2011. Urlacher and Lewis bring to 28 the number of modern-era linebackers in the Hall. Five of those 28 were Bears  a nod to the history of the position for the franchise from George Connor to Bill George  Dick Butkus  Mike Singletary and now  Urlacher . “It’s unreal ”  Urlacher  said. “It’s a great tradition.” Selected ninth in the first round of the 2000 draft   Urlacher  becomes the first Hall of Fame playerfrom the University of New Mexico.  He  was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and was an established star before coach Lovie Smith arrived in 2004 with a scheme that accentuated  Urlacher ’s freakish athletic ability for a player with such a large frame — 6-foot-4  258 pounds. The next year  he  was named the league’s Defensive Player of the Year  becoming the fifth player to win both awards. The next season  in 2006   Urlacher  helped lead the Bears to Super Bowl XLI. Named to the NFL’s All-Decade Team of the 2000s   Urlacher  was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times and was first team All-Pro five times. In 13 seasons  according to pro-football-reference.com   he  amassed 1 354 tackles  41½ sacks  22 interceptions  two touchdowns  90 passes defensed  11 forced fumbles and 15 fumble recoveries. Personnel boss Mark Hatley made the decision to draft Urlacher  who had played safety in college. The Bears knew they were getting a player who could transform their defense but initially weren’t sure how to deploy  him . “We knew we would like to play  him  at the mike (middle) linebacker  but the problem was  he  had been a safety  and we didn’t want to stick  him  there right away and beat  him  up and lose  him  and ruin an excellent prospect ” defensive coordinator Greg Blache said. “We started  him  off at the sam (strong-side) linebacker position  where everything is coming at you from one direction in the traffic  and we played  him  at the mike in the nickel situation  where 95 percent of it was passing. So  he  was getting a feel for it but  he  wasn’t getting in the heavy traffic with the guards coming on  him  and combination blocks … because it’s a whole different beast when you’re playing 12 to 15 yards deep as a safety and you move up to 5 yards from the line of scrimmage with the 300-pounders. “We knew we had something special and we knew  he  would be a guy who would be a hell of a player for a long  long time if we had some patience and were just judicious in how we approached it. Having (linebackers coach) Dale Lindsey there was a huge help because Dale had developed so many linebackers and he was a great voice in saying he had seen rush jobs when guys were put in situations they weren’t quite ready to handle. It ended up working out really well just because we got him eased into it to the point where he was comfortable seeing it all happen.” It happened faster than anyone would have imagined  which in retrospect isn’t surprising to anyone who was involved. Lindsey marveled at the amount of information  Urlacher  could process and then apply on the field. A lot of players  even really good ones  can lose the fine details when they move from the meeting room to the practice field and then into games  but  Urlacher  absorbed it all. When middle linebacker Barry Minter was sidelined with a back injury in the third week of the 2000 season  the Bears moved  Urlacher . They never again discussed where  he  was best suited to play or what  he  could handle. “(Head coach) Dick Jauron said  ‘Put  him  at the middle ’ ” Lindsey said. “Dick could see the big picture. Luckily for us  Brian was more than willing to learn the new position. It’s nice when you have rare talent and a guy who wants to do it. That’s the difference between the real great players — they want to do it and they’ll do anything to be successful. He was like a sponge. You just kept giving him information and he absorbed it and would want more. The thing about the guys with the rare talent: They can do any damn thing you ask them. You can ask them the impossible and they can get it done. And Brian did it for us as a great middle linebacker.” When the Bears signed massive defensive tackles Ted Washington and Keith Traylor in 2001   Urlacher  raised  his  game to a new level as the duo kept offensive linemen off of  him  and allowed  him  to make plays with  his  remarkable speed. “There are a lot of guys who can run fast in a straight line  but the athleticism  he  showed for a guy that size  off the charts ” Blache said. He spearheaded the “Monday Night Miracle” at Arizona in 2006 with 25 tackles and a forced fumble that resulted in a touchdown.  Urlacher  had five interceptions and five sacks in 2007  a testament to  his  ability to do anything needed.  Urlacher  was never very comfortable in the spotlight but always at ease around  his  teammates  which made  him  immensely popular.  He  treated the newest rookie the same way  he  did the most tenured veterans. When former teammate Todd Johnson became a high school coach in Sarasota  Fla.  he didn’t have enough uniforms to dress all of his players.  Urlacher  provided new jerseys — home and away — for the entire roster and did so without seeking any attention  one of countless anecdotes of how  he  helped friends.

U.S. lawmakers grilled Trump administration officials Tuesday about the war in Afghanistan, saying the new White House strategy was inconsistent and was not producing results. The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy. After Sullivan and a top Pentagon official told the lawmakers that the U.S. was in fact still open to negotiations with the Taliban, lawmakers pressed for more details. \\"You can see that the world and those involved in the peace process may be pretty confused about what the U.S. position is. What is it?\\" asked Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Sullivan said he thought Trump was expressing a reaction to last month's terrorist attacks, and was pointing out that \\"significant elements of the Taliban are not prepared to negotiate.\\" \\"And it may take a long time before they are willing to negotiate,\\" he added. But many in the Senate appear tired of waiting, and that impatience was on display Tuesday.

A:","output":"TWA Flight 553 was involved in a mid-air collision with a Beechcraft Baron private aircraft on March 9, 1967, resulting in the deaths of all passengers and crew members on both aircraft. The crash occurred near Urbana, Ohio, as TWA Flight 553 was descending towards Dayton International Airport, while the Beechcraft Baron was climbing after taking off from a local airport. I will now gather and present additional facts related to TWA Flight 553 to provide a comprehensive understanding of the event, the aircraft, and the TWA's actions before and after the crash. 1. Aircraft Model: TWA Flight 553 was operated using a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 jet airliner, a popular and reliable commercial aircraft during the 1960s and 1970s. 2. Aircraft Registration: The specific aircraft involved in the accident was registered as N1063T. 3. Aircraft Delivery: There is no publicly available information on the exact delivery date of the aircraft involved in the accident, but the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 series first entered commercial service in December 1965, and TWA was among the initial customers for the aircraft. Thus, the aircraft in question was likely delivered to TWA close to that time. 4. Collision Details: It is believed that the pilot of the Beechcraft Baron, who was flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), failed to maintain proper visual separation from the much faster TWA Flight 553, which was flying under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). It was also noted that the TWA aircraft was descending at a higher speed than recommended. 5. Investigation: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the accident and concluded that the probable cause was inadequate control of air traffic in the vicinity of the Dayton International Airport along with the procedural failure of air traffic control personnel. 6. Aftermath: As a result of this accident and other similar incidents, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) introduced changes to improve the overall air traffic control system and procedures to prevent such mid-air collisions in the future. This included requiring strict adherence to aircraft separation standards, improvements in radar equipment, and the establishment of the Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSA) to provide radar-based traffic advisories in high-density traffic areas around airports. In conclusion, while the exact delivery date of the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 aircraft involved in the TWA Flight 553 crash is unavailable, it can be deduced that it was likely to have been delivered close to the time when DC-9 series first entered commercial service in December 1965. The tragic crash on March 9, 1967, resulted in significant changes to air traffic control procedures to ensure better safety and prevent similar accidents from occurring in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) is an international organization that brings together zoos and aquariums to cooperate in efforts to advance the respectful, humane  treatment of animals in our care, and to support the conservation of animals across the globe. WAZA was shocked and disappointed to learn of the inappropriate and damaging content in the new TV show Wonderful Friends, jointly produced by China's biggest zoo & circus company (Chimelong) and one of China's top TV companies (Hunan TV). The show dresses up chimpanzees in human clothes and markets them as \\"cute pets\\". The animals are placed in many stressful and harmful situations, in order to create \\"entertaining\\" story lines. It is disappointing to note that Chinese pop singer and actress Li Yuchun took part in this show, helping to popularize these misleading and inhumane practices. In one example, a young chimp bit an actress in the face right next to a zoo visitor, and then bit another actor leaving a wound on his hand. WAZA is strongly against practices and shows of this nature. Animals presented in such cruel and unnatural surroundings cannot contribute to serious conservation efforts. Presenting chimpanzees in unnatural and anthropomorphic  settings suggests to viewers that they are not endangered and make great pets. Such shows are not only disrespectful to animals, they also lack any sort of conservation purpose.  According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, chimpanzees are now considered endangered, and wild populations are declining rapidly.  WAZA recognizes that the growing popularity of television programmes such as Wonderful Friends can only increase the already-huge existing demand for chimpanzees as pets. WAZA requests the following: (1) The immediate cancel of this programme and similar shows wherever they may take place; (2) That all animals held in captivity  be provided with the highest level of care; (3) That under no circumstances should chimpanzees be imported from the wild just for entertainment purposes. A:","output":"Which statement best describes the concerns raised by the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) regarding the TV show Wonderful Friends? A. WAZA appreciates the show's effort to present chimpanzees as cute pets, promoting animal conservation. B. WAZA believes the show showcases chimpanzees in natural settings and contributes to conservation efforts. C. WAZA is concerned about the show's portrayal of chimpanzees in stressful situations and unnatural settings, potentially misleading viewers and promoting inhumane treatment of animals. D.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What does Eep's family do to the thing she got from a modern human boy? , can you please find it?   A cave family called the Croods survives a natural disaster, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn and stern patriarch named Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired and bicker, but Grug doesn't listen.

People may be afraid of disturbing you or being rude if you talk with someone else. Bring a book or newspaper to read. Plus, having an interesting book with you will give others an excuse tostart a conversation if they've read it. 3.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still  regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora. A:","output":"The Knight Errant"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the last name of the two art critics who wrote about Virgin of Solitude? ?  A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards idolatry of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, \\"It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.\\" Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were \\"illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form\\".The published edition of The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a wreath, intended as a personification of Spain, Truth, or the Constitution of 1812—which Ferdinand had rejected in 1814. In plate 79, Murió la Verdad (The Truth has died), she lies dead. In plate 80, Si resucitará? (Will she live again?), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in a halo of light before a mob of \\"monks and monsters\\". In plate 82, Esto es lo verdadero (This is the true way), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies in front of a peasant.

Sacked: Paul Kellerman lost his job as a delivery driver after being wrongly recorded doing 103 mph when he was only driving at 34 mph. A delivery driver who was wrongly recorded speeding at 103 mph has been sacked despite the police apologising for the blunder and his van being unable to go above 70 mph. Paul Kellerman, 43, was dismissed after his firm received a prosecution notice stating he was caught speeding in a 40 mph zone, when he had actually been travelling at just 34 mph. The manager of the police force's speed camera unit later admitted the error, but the company would not relent and Mr Kellerman is still looking for another job. He was on his way to deliver electrical goods to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, when he noticed a speed camera flash as he drove along the Hatfield Road in St Albans. Paul, of Cudworth in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said: 'I saw the signs and knew it was a 40 mph zone but I knew I wasn't doing much more than 30 mph. 'I was gutted but I knew I was well under the limit. It's a high street, you can't do 103 mph and I wouldn't do that anyway.' His van even had a speed limiter on it, meaning it cannot go above 70 mph. Mr Kellerman contacted the police to complain and officers admitted their mistake. A letter from the speed unit manager said: 'On further investigation it is apparent that you were travelling within the speed limit at 34 mph in a 40 mph zone and the ticket was issued as a result of operator error.' The unit manager even telephone Mr Kellerman's boss but his job had already been filled. The speed camera had wrongly recorded the speed of Mr Kellerman's vehicle and the operator failed to check the speed before issuing the notice. Mr Kellerman, who worked up to 80 hours a week for £320, also called the speed unit and said they could not apologise enough. He said: 'I was told it was an error on their part. They kept saying they were sorry and I wasn't the first person but I have still lost my job.' Mr Kellerman has lost a stone and a half in weight since being sacked. He has also signed up for housing benefits and has had to ask for help in paying his rent. Error: Mr Kellerman was travelling at just 34 mph when he was flashed by the speed camera (library image) He said: 'I tried to explain to my boss that I would never drive so fast but was replaced straight away because of the constant flow of work. It's not him I'm mad at it is the police. 'I know everyone makes mistakes but not on that scale. If I'd not got a letter of apology nobody would believe me. 'I would have had to go to court and would have got an automatic ban. Other people have got to complain.' A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'A notice of prosecution was issued in this instance in error. 'As soon as it was brought to our attention we retracted the notice and apologised to Mr Kellerman. 'We have written to him to confirm non further action will be taken in respect of the notice and have also offered to write to the company but Mr Kellerman declined this offer. 'We have also spoken to the employer to explain the situation. The subject of his employment is a matter for him and the company.'

Summarize this article in one sentence. Start with the goal of the game and work backwards to figure out what players will need to do to get there. Ideally, the rules you create should be simple, logical, and consistent, so that the game plays out the same way every time (with different results, of course).  In many classic board games, players roll dice and move their game piece a certain number of spaces depending on the number that comes up. More sophisticated games, like \\"Thunderstone\\" or \\"Settlers of Catan,\\" challenge players to build strong card decks or score points in order to win. For a game with a “paperboy” theme, players might roll to complete their newspaper route before the school bell rings while encountering obstacles like lawn sprinklers and unfriendly dogs on the gameboard. Keep them extremely basic at first. Little by little, you can make your rule system more intricate by adding secondary objectives, random events, or penalties for making poor decisions. Different types of games will work better with a different number of players. Most board games are designed for 2-4 players, but it may be possible for as many as 6 people to participate if the rules are simple and there are enough cards or pieces to go around.  Keep in mind that the more people you have playing, the more difficult it will be to make the game mechanics work. A head-to-head strategy game could be played by as few as 2-3 people, whereas one that involves identifying a criminal from a lineup of suspects would benefit from having more players in order to make the gameplay more of a challenge. Your game might call for individual player pieces, cards, tokens, or any number of other components, depending on the theme and specific mechanics. The choice of what type of item will be used to perform the different actions is ultimately up to you. However, it will be best to go with accessories that are most practical for accomplishing the game’s goal. Stick to 1 or 2 components to keep the gameplay from getting convoluted. Players who are forced to juggle cards, coins, dice, and a pen-and-paper scorekeeping system will quickly find themselves overwhelmed. Now that you have an idea of how your game will play out, envision the exact form it will take. Designate your starting and ending points, draw out spaces, and mark where important pieces will be played. Be sure to label what each element is and describe how players will interact with them. When you’re finished, you’ll have a working blueprint for your game.  The simplest game boards are there to direct the players’ movements. Others might serve as a platform for laying down cards and reading their outcomes, or provide clues for solving puzzles. Commit a crude version of your game board to paper as soon as an idea hits you. This will make it easier for you to work out any remaining kinks without losing the thread of the game.","output":"This article explains how to create a board game by starting with the goal, making simple and consistent rules, considering the number of players, choosing game components, and designing the game board, while keeping the game enjoyable and easy to understand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

When that didn't work, they called in a state police helicopter.      The helicopter pilot used the p.a. to order the crowd to disperse. And then apparently used the downdraft to get the point across, blowing down canopies, etc.. Although I don't personally think that was the intent.            Two interesting things to note:      1) At 28 seconds you can see that someone in the area of the red canopies, threw something up at the helicopter. Whatever was thrown only made it to about half the height of the helicopter.      2) At 1:20 into the video, you can see that something is dropped/thrown straight down from the helicopter, into the crowd. I have no idea what the object was, but it appeared to be about the size of a 2-liter bottle.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was appointed as chief engraver in 1844?  James Barton Longacre (August 11, 1794 – January 1, 1869) was an American portraitist and engraver, and the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1844 until his death. Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.  Longacre's coins are generally well-regarded today, although they have been criticized for lack of artistic...

Finally stones, pebbles   and grains of sand were formed. Many sorts of plants and animals lived and died on the surface of the earth. Their remains mixed up with the stones, pebbles and formed soil. The outmost layer of the earth is soil. There are many ways in which large pieces of rock break into smaller ones. Wind, water, heat and cold help to break up rocks. When winds blow grains of sand against a large rock for a long time, the softer layers of the rock are slowly worn away. These leave holes and cracks in the rock, which become bigger and finally the rock breaks up into smaller pieces. The moving water of streams and rivers also helps to break up rocks. As the water moves along, it carries with it small pieces of rock. These rub the larger ones. Thus, the larger rocks are worn down to smaller pieces. The heat of the sun is also helpful to breaking up rocks. When the sun shines, the rocks become very hot. If these rocks are suddenly cooled, they may crack. Ice also plays a part in making soil. Water in the cracks can turn into ice in cold weather. As this happens, it becomes bigger and the cracks become wider, and finally break into smaller pieces. Question: Which of the following speeds up  the breaks of rocks most? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Sharp changes in temperature.\\"?

Mrs. Kinsolving (Rosemary Murphy) is cold to Francesca, questions whether she is actually pregnant with her son's baby, and tells Francesca she wants nothing to do with her or her baby in the future. It soon becomes clear that Francesca cannot leave that night as a blizzard has made the roads impassable. Francesca is forced to stay in the Kinsolving mansion for a few days. She soon begins to suspect that something is amiss due to inconsistencies in information between what her late husband (Matthew) told her and Mrs. Kinsolving's statements to her. While Matthew never mentioned he had a sister, Mrs. Kinsolving claims that the mentally challenged and non-verbal Kathleen (Sian Barbara Allen) is Matthew's sister. After Mrs. Kinsolving retires for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family Bible that Matthew's mother (Maria) died eleven days after Matthew was killed in the Vietnam War, that Mrs. Kinsolving is actually Maria's sister in law, Katherine, who is Kathleen's mother and the mother of Kenny (Richard Thomas), a serial rapist and murderer who is hiding somewhere in the Kinsolving mansion. Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands the baby over to Kathleen to bury. That night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby (who is actually very much alive) in a picnic basket. Mrs. Kinsolving, suspecting Francesca is sneaking around the mansion, locks her in her room. Kathleen is able to locate the key to the room and unlocks it, allowing Francesca to care for her baby. One night, Francesca secretly spies the unsuspecting Kenny who is hiding in the basement laundry. She overhears his conversation with Mrs....

TEXT:There have been many film and TV productions of Jane Eyre each with aspects to recommend them, but I suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now. It's just a classic (and offers much more of the story than others do). Timothy Dalton is utterly in his element as Rochester, rarely missing the mark; his performance is astonishingly nimble and many-colored, while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character. Zelah Clarke's Jane is more cerebral than otherworldly, but she makes a perfect foil for Dalton (who, appropriately, towers over her!) The nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing (once you've absorbed the shock of Dalton's charisma). There are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better; though this pretty much was a top-of-the-line production by the BBC's standards of that time.

Question: Brett and Scott were both studying bacteria for their exam. Scott read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while his colleague Brett read more about non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes.  Which student read less about the production of the highly toxic dimethylmercury?  Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Scott read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while Brett read more about non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes. The passage states that sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of highly toxic forms of mercury, such as methyl- and dimethylmercury.

The lyrics of both \\"Son of Three\\" and \\"The She\\" suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, \\"Put on a Side\\", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's \\"voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain,\\" as she repeats twelve words over the course of the song: \\"Better I better I stayed up / Better mono, put on a side.\\"An earlier version of \\"Full on Idle\\", Title TK's eighth track, was released on the Amps' Pacer in 1995.

Paper trays have multiple tiers so you can separate different types of documents. Pick a vertical paper tray if you don’t have a lot of space, or a horizontal tray if you have some room to spare. Put the organizer near the edge of your desk so you can reach it easily throughout the day and grab what you need. Label each of the tiers so you know where certain documents should go.  You can buy paper trays from office supply stores. Paper trays also work great for holding folders or notebooks. Designate a section of your desk to stay clean so you have room to spread out if you need to. Wall pockets are plastic trays that have multiple compartments to file documents and folders. Put a wall pocket near your desk so you can remove papers from your desk and reduce clutter. Make sure the different compartments are labeled so you don’t get confused later on. Wall pockets can also be hung on the back of your door. Find a place on your wall that has enough space for a bulletin board and put one up. Organize the bulletin board into sections where you can pin items, such as documents, receipts, sticky notes, and memos. Keep the most important documents visible and stack older ones underneath.  Many cubicles already have walls that you can put thumbtacks in. Use differently colored thumbtacks for each type of document you hang. For example, you may hang memos with blue pins and receipts with red ones. You can also pin personal photos if you don’t have space for them on your desk. Get file folders in various colors and sort your documents so similar ones all share a single color. For example, you may put different types of expenses in red folders and income forms in green folders. Label the tabs on the folders with what type of document is inside. Once you have your documents organized, put them in a filing cabinet in a paper tray so you can find them easily. You can also attach colored labels to the tabs of file folders if you don’t want to buy multiple colors. If you want to cut back on the amount of paper you’re using, try writing any of your notes or schedules on your computer. Create folders on your computer and sort your documents into them, or use an online program to organize your files. Once a file is outdated, delete it so it doesn’t clutter up your computer.  Backup any important documents on a cloud storage site or external hard drive so you don’t lose them if your computer ever crashes. If you have a scanner, you can upload physical documents onto your computer so you can get rid of the paper documents. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to keep your papers and documents organized and safe.

Write an article based on this summary: French Ligue 1 side Lille have appointed former Argentina boss Marcelo Bielsa for the 2017-18 season.","output":"Title: Lille Appoints Former Argentina Boss Marcelo Bielsa as Head Coach for the 2017-18 Season Introduction: In a move meant to bring experience and a fresh start to their football club, French Ligue 1 side Lille has announced the appointment of former Argentina and Chile national team head coach, Marcelo Bielsa, for the 2017-18 season. (Step 1: Introduce the main subject and context of the article - the appointment of Marcelo Bielsa as Lille's head coach) Bielsa's Previous Successes: Marcelo Bielsa, affectionately known as 'El Loco' due to his unorthodox tactics and demanding training sessions, has had a successful coaching career with notable achievements. Under his leadership, Argentina progressed to the finals of both the 2004 Copa America and the 2004 Olympic Games, with the latter resulting in a gold medal for the South American nation. (Step 2: Provide background on Bielsa's achievements to establish credibility as a coach) Furthermore, Bielsa was instrumental in shaping Chile's national team into a formidable force between 2007 and 2011, effectively guiding them to the knockout stages of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. At the club level, the Argentine has managed several reputable European teams, including Spain's Athletic Bilbao and France’s Marseille. (Step 3: Mention Bielsa's other coaching experiences, illustrating his well-rounded football knowledge) Lille's Vision for the Future: The appointment of Bielsa demonstrates Lille's commitment to raising the team's profile within French football and competing on the European stage. Capitalizing on Bielsa's attacking mindset and tactical prowess, the club will be looking to improve its league position and challenge for domestic and international titles in the coming seasons. (Step 4: Connect Bielsa's skills to Lille's aspirations) Challenges and Expectations: While the expectations for Lille are high under Bielsa's leadership, the team faces several significant challenges. One such challenge is the need to strengthen their squad while remaining within their budget constraints. Bielsa's reputation for attracting talented, young players and his ability to develop them into world-class athletes will be crucial to overcoming this hurdle. (Step 5: Discuss challenges and expectations for Bielsa and Lille) Conclusion: With the appointment of Marcelo Bielsa, Lille has made a significant statement of intent for the 2017-18 season. Bielsa's impressive track record at both national and club levels cannot be understated, and fans across the football community eagerly await to see what he brings to the French Ligue 1 side. Time will tell whether this appointment will take Lille to new heights, but the initial excitement and anticipation is understandably high.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"It is documentary evidence against me.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"That book is a piece of evidence against me.\\" true?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"That book is a piece of evidence against me\\" is true based on the given premise \\"It is documentary evidence against me,\\" one must first carefully examine and interpret the meanings and implications of the terms \\"documentary evidence\\" and \\"book.\\" Documentary evidence refers to any form of evidence presented through documents, which can include written materials or other types of recorded information that can be presented in legal or investigatory settings. Examples of documentary evidence include contracts, emails, letters, and photographs, among others. The primary purpose of documentary evidence is to substantiate a claim, allegation, or statement by providing tangible, verifiable information. A book, in its most common form, consists of printed or written pages typically bound together with a protective cover. Books can be authored in various forms, including fiction, historical accounts, instructional works, and collections of research and evidence. In certain contexts, a book can serve as a form of documentary evidence if its contents contribute to the establishment of a factual claim or demonstrate a particular viewpoint in a conclusive manner. Given the premise \\"It is documentary evidence against me\\" and the above explanations of both documentary evidence and books, one can now assess the hypothesis \\"That book is a piece of evidence against me.\\" To do so, we will evaluate two critical factors: whether the term \\"it\\" refers to the mentioned book and whether the content of the book can be considered a form of documentary evidence. 1. Identifying the reference: To deduce whether the term \\"it\\" refers to the book mentioned in the hypothesis, one must assume the hypothesis is accurate and coherent. Since the book is specified in the hypothesis and not in the premise, the context may be insufficient to clearly identify the relationship between the two statements. Nonetheless, considering that both the premise and the hypothesis revolve around the concept of documentary evidence, we can reasonably deduce that \\"it\\" refers to the same source of evidence mentioned in both statements – the book. 2. Assessing the content: To conclusively determine if the hypothesis is true, one must examine the book's content as well. If the book contains information that can be used to implicate the speaker in legal or investigatory proceedings, then the book fits the definition of documentary evidence. The clarity and accuracy of assumptions regarding the two factors ensure that the hypothesis is highly likely to be true. If the term \\"it\\" refers to the book mentioned in the hypothesis, and the content of the book serves as a form of documentary evidence against the speaker, then the hypothesis \\"That book is a piece of evidence against me\\" aligns with the premise \\"It is documentary evidence against me.\\" In conclusion, based on the analysis of the provided premise and the nature of documentary evidence and books, the hypothesis \\"That book is a piece of evidence against me\\" is likely true. However, a definitive answer would require more specific contextual information that directly connects the premises and the hypothesis, as examination alone cannot guarantee absolute certainty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Isolate the term containing the variable (z) To isolate the term containing z (which is 22 * z), we need to get rid of the constant term on the same side of the equation (which is -40). To do this, we'll add 40 to both sides of the equation. 22 * z - 40 + 40 = -18 + 40 22 * z = 22 Step 3: Solve for the variable (z) Now that we have isolated the term containing the variable (z), we can solve for z by dividing both sides of the equation by 22. 22 * z / 22 = 22 / 22 z = 1 So, the solution to the equation 22 * z - 40 = -18 is z = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The given information suggests that a variety of organizations from different fields, including disarmament, environmental, peace, and religious groups, have joined forces to stage a boycott. This collective action aims to pressure French companies and, ultimately, encourage then-President Jacques Chirac to put an end to all nuclear weapons testing. By conducting a boycott, these organizations directly affect the economic activity of the companies involved, which can then lead to monetary losses and financial hardships for the businesses. In turn, this can prompt companies to re-evaluate their support for the policies and decisions that led to the boycott in the first place - in this case, nuclear weapons testing. In addition to the economic pressure generated by the boycott, the vast array of organizations involved in the coalition showcases widespread international support for the goal of ending French nuclear tests. The participation of these diverse groups implies that this perspective is widely shared among various sectors of society and across different countries. By demonstrating this global support, the boycott further amplifies the pressure placed on French companies and their government with the ultimate objective of ceasing all nuclear weapons testing.

Investigators from Kenai Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation also conducted a ground search, and a helicopter peered down looking for clues.      “Both of these expansive efforts did not reveal the location of the missing persons,” KPD wrote in a release.      Family members last heard from Adams on May 27 when she made a phone call to her sister, Lanell Adams, in which the missing mother sounded “distressed.”      There was no sign of forced entry into the apartment and officers found the door to the apartment locked.

Rebecca Adams, 22, her two daughters aged 5 and 3, and her 37-year-old boyfriend Brandon Jividen were reported missing on May 27 from their home in Kenai, a city of about 7,300 residents 65 miles (105 km) southwest of Anchorage.      An FBI canine scent detection team recently completed an extended search in wooded areas near the family’s apartment, Kenai Police said in a statement late on Wednesday. Ground searches, accompanied by aerial assistance, also ended.      The department added in its statement that “there was no sign of forced entry into the apartment and officers found the door to the apartment locked. Investigators did not observe any signs of a struggle or obvious signs of foul play in the apartment.”      The police said investigators “continue to work diligently on this highest priority investigation.”      Officers distributed more photos this week of the family and vehicles left at their apartment. Authorities had already distributed photos to law enforcement agencies throughout Alaska.      Police said family members last heard from Rebecca Adams on May 27. She was seen on a local business surveillance video several days earlier. Police also said they had evidence she was driving one of the family vehicles on May 25.      Authorities say the family uncharacteristically left their home without notice, without paying rent, leaving behind their cars, camping gear and the children’s car seats. The family's dog is also missing.      (Editing by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Peter Cooney) ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia.

Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe.

Article:","output":"Title: Lambing Live Presenter Addresses the Growing Concern of Food Waste and the Disconnection between the Public and Agriculture Introduction: In recent years, food waste has become a major environmental and economic concern across the globe. Lambing Live presenter, a passionate advocate for sustainable farming practices, has boldly declared food waste as \\"endemic\\" and criticized on how the public is too disconnected from the farming process. This article delves into the issues affecting the farming industry, the implications of widespread food waste, and the importance of reconnecting consumers with agriculture to build a more sustainable future. Food Waste: An Endemic Problem According to the Lambing Live presenter, food waste has become endemic, meaning it's a constant occurrence and an issue ingrained in society. This is a startling fact, as food waste has negative repercussions on multiple fronts. From an economic standpoint, throwing away perfectly good food leads to higher production costs, increased prices, and a strain on supply chains. Environmentally, food waste contributes significantly to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, since rotting food in landfills releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The Disconnection between the Public and Agriculture The Lambing Live presenter argues that one of the primary reasons for food waste is the detachment between the general public and the farming process. Nowadays, people are primarily living in urban environments, and their interaction with food is limited to supermarkets, grocery stores, and restaurants. There's a lack of understanding of how food is produced, the labor that goes into the process, and the sustainable farming practices that contribute to more environmentally and economically sustainable food systems. The public's misconception regarding perfect-looking produce cultivates a culture of waste. Many consumers believe that only fruits and vegetables with a perfect appearance are of high quality, leading to an increase in food waste at the production level. The significant number of discarded produce shows that many people are not aware of the impact their choices have on the environment and the economy at large. Reconnecting the Public with Agriculture Building a bridge between the public and agriculture is crucial to address the endemic issue of food waste. It starts with educating people on the importance of sustainable farming practices and the impact of their food choices on the environment and the economy. The Lambing Live presenter suggests that the media, educational institutions, and non-governmental organizations should play a significant role in this endeavor by spreading awareness about food production systems. Farm-to-table initiatives, community gardening, and visits to local farms can help reconnect people with the process of producing their food. This can help them gain an appreciation for the hard work of farmers, and it encourages them to make more informed choices when it comes to food consumption. Studies show that when people are more connected to the farming process, they are less likely to waste food. Additionally, government policies that support sustainable agriculture, such as providing incentives for responsible farming practices, combating food waste, and investing in infrastructure that supports local and organic food systems, can play a significant role in preserving our environment. Conclusion: The Lambing Live presenter's declaration of food waste as endemic and the concern for the public's detachment from farming are critical issues that need urgent attention. By reconnecting consumers to agriculture, promoting education about sustainable farming practices, and implementing policies that address food waste, we can ensure a more sustainable future for the planet and the people living on it. With collective effort and understanding, a change can be brought about to bridge the gap between the public and agriculture, ultimately reducing food waste for a greener and more sustainable future."},{"instruction":"Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the benefit that marked the last time Bowie performed his music on stage?

In advance of the debut of what has quickly become must-see TV, The Hollywood Reporter rounds up everything we know about the show (so far).      What Is It?      A new half-hour satirical comedy from the actor, who returns to series television for the first time in more than a decade. Per Showtime, the \\"seven-episode series explores the diverse individuals, from the infamous to the unknown across the political and cultural spectrum, who populate our unique nation.\\"      Who Is Behind It?      The series was created and is executive produced by Baron Cohen. Other EPs include the actor's longtime collaborators Anthony Hines, Todd Schulman, Andrew Newman and Dan Mazer — who were all involved in at least one of Baron Cohen's Da Ali G Show-related projects (including its spinoff movies) — and The Daily Show's Adam Lowitt.      When Does It Premiere?      Who Is America? debuts Sunday, July 15, at midnight ET/Saturday, July 14, 9 p.m. PT online and on Showtime On Demand, and will debut on air July 15 at 10 p.m. on Showtime. Subsequent episodes will be released Sundays at 10 p.m. through Aug. 26.      How Long Has It Been In the Works?      Baron Cohen has been filming segments for the series during the past year, and a producer claiming to be working on a Showtime documentary series called The Age of Reason set up an interview with Ted Koppel — so the series has been set at Showtime since at least late 2017.      But details didn't begin leaking until Baron Cohen's mysterious Trump teaser, which was likely filmed following the former reality star's appearance on Da Ali G Show in 2003.      A message from your President @realDonaldTrump on Independence Day pic.twitter.com/O2PwZqO0cs — Sacha Baron Cohen (@SachaBaronCohen) July 4, 2018      That segment featured Baron Cohen's Ali G trying to get the then-Apprentice star to invest in an ice cream glove. While Trump tweeted that he immediately discovered the ruse ...      I never fall for scams. I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2012      ... Baron Cohen told James Corden on The Late Late Show that Trump was actually there for \\"about seven minutes.\\"      A few days after the Independence Day teaser, Baron Cohen released another video hinting at a new project, with footage of Dick Cheney signing the interviewer's \\"waterboard kit.\\"      Cohen's publicist later confirmed that the signed waterboard kit is available to bid on eBay. Auction for the kit will benefit Amnesty International.      The following day came Showtime's official announcement and the first trailer for the series.      Who Has Been Duped?      According to Drudge, both Republicans and Democrats were targeted, including Cheney, Sarah Palin, Howard Dean, Alberto Gonzales, Bernie Sanders, Trent Lott, David Petraeus, Ted Koppel and more. Former vice presidential candidate Palin was the first to speak out about the incident, penning a note accusing Baron Cohen of posing as a wounded soldier. After first speaking out in a Facebook post (below), Palin eventually revealed more details on Good Morning America about what she called a \\"sick\\" interview. \\"It mocked our values,\\" she said. \\"It was occurring to me that whatever this show is, whatever this interview really is, it is all about humiliation and devaluing middle-class Americans whom I represent.\\"      Yup - we were duped. Ya’ got me, Sacha. Feel better now? I join a long list of American public personalities who have... Posted by Sarah Palin on Tuesday, July 10, 2018      Then came former congressman and current radio host Joe Walsh, who said he thought he was doing an interview to talk about his pro-Israel stance, and the interview was cut short when a fight broke out.      I totally believe @SarahPalinUSA's account of the @SachaBaronCohen incident. Dressing up as a wounded veteran is absolutely stolen valor, his tactics are disguisting - I know cause I too was duped. Here is what happened...#BoycottShowtime — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) July 11, 2018      Former Alabama judge Roy Moore, who lost the race for an open Senate seat in his state after allegations of an inappropriate encounter with a 14-year-old girl, then released a statement saying he was targeted and threatening legal action against the comedian. “I did not know Sacha Cohen or that a Showtime TV series was being planned to embarrass, humiliate, and mock not only Israel, but also religious conservatives such as Sarah Palin, Joe Walsh, and Dick Cheney,” he wrote.      Ted Koppel revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that he was interviewed by the same character who duped Palin. A producer purporting to be from a new Showtime documentary series said the show would include \\"conversations with distinguished experts in science and public policy, highlighting the brightest and most reputable minds on today's most important topics.\\" The show was supposed to include \\"ordinary folk interviewing the expert,\\" and a man in a wheelchair \\"with an oxygen tank hanging off one of the handles\\" arrived to Koppel's home and began asking him questions about the size of Trump's inauguration, but refused to concede even the most rudimentary of facts (like, say, the sun would have been down if a photograph were taken at 11 p.m.). Koppel said he cut the interview short after that.      What Characters Is He Playing?      So far, the only confirmed character is Dr. Billy Wayne Ruddick, the guy who duped Palin. A Twitter account for the character (retweeted by Baron Cohen) has been active since mid-May, tweeting links to stories hosted on his Infowars-like website, Truthbrary.org (sample articles: \\"Hillary is Satanist Illuminati,\\" \\"Secret CIA Time Travel\\" and more).      Baron Cohen retweeted a statement from that account in response to Palin's accusations.      \\"I am Dr. Billy Wayne Ruddick, founder/ceo/accountant of Truthbrary.org and it was I that interviewed you,\\" he wrote. \\"I did NOT say I was a War Vet. I was in the service — not military, but United Parcel, and I only fought for my country once. When I shot a Mexican who came onto my property. (Coincidentally, just like our Great President, I was sadly prevented from joining the regular army on account of bone spurs bein discovered in my testies.)\\"      Conservative radio host Austin Rhodes told THR he was duped during a live radio interview while the comedian was posing as Dr. Nira Cain, a professor of gender and women's studies at Reed College in Portland. Rhodes told THR that \\"some of 'Dr. Cain's' best hits from the interview included calling the U.S. Army 'an active terrorist organization,' saying that The Dukes of Hazzard is like the Southern version of Roots,' and my favorite, claiming that 'white supremacists are responsible for most of the gun deaths in America.'\\"      The production team even set up a fake Amazon listing for a book supposedly authored by Cain.      One day after the show's premiere, Showtime released a statement about the Dr. Ruddick character in response to Palin and a hijacked Hollywood billboard spreading \\"misinformation.\\" The statement read: \\"There has been widespread misinformation over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., Ph.D., performed by Sacha Baron Cohen on the Showtime comedy series Who Is America? Baron Cohen did not present himself as a disabled veteran, and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere on Sunday can now attest to that. In Sunday’s episode, during an interview with Senator Bernie Sanders, Baron Cohen in character as Dr. Ruddick was asked by the Senator if he is disabled, and he stated that he is not and uses a mobility scooter to conserve his energy. In addition, Baron Cohen never presented himself as a veteran of the U.S. military to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin during the booking process or during the filming of her interview, and contrary to her claims he did not appear in a wheelchair. In both the interview with Governor Palin and the interview with Senator Sanders, he did not wear military apparel of any kind.\\"      Did Anyone Catch On?      According to Rhodes, many of his listeners believed the interview — which was broadcast live — was \\"performance art\\" and he learned of Baron Cohen's involvement when a listener connected the name of the supervising producer, which was mentioned on air, with someone who had been involved with Borat.      Said Rhodes, \\"The listener told us that [Todd] Schulman was the man who had secured his participation as a guest in the infamous \\"Southern dinner scene\\" in the hilarious Cohen movie Borat. A quick IMDb check revealed Schulman to be connected to virtually every project Cohen had starred in dating back to the Da Ali G Show, including Cohen's new show. I was flummoxed. I have been a fan of Cohen's work for years, and I have seen Borat probably 20 times from start to finish. How in the hell did I miss that this was Sacha Baron Cohen? When I replayed the show, literally the very next day, his voice was obvious, despite a clever attempt to disguise the voice we have heard in countless dialects and characters.\\"      While local news reported the appearance at the time, no other media caught on.      Who Is America? premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on Showtime. Stay tuned to THR for a review and full coverage of the series. ||||| Photo: Jeffrey Mayer (Getty Images)      As we get closer to this Sunday’s premiere of Who Is America?, Sacha Baron Cohen’s return to the TV prank/interview genre, more and more of Baron Cohen’s “victims” seem positively desperate to step forward and perform inadvertent PR for the series. Sarah Palin has already made her objections to the Showtime show known in a way that can only drive ratings forward, and she’s now been joined by Alabama judge, defeated Senate candidate, and accused creep Roy Moore, who issued a statement threatening to sue Baron Cohen for tricking him into appearing on the series, which we have to assume is a big part of the point of clowning on Roy Moore in the first place.      Not that Baron Cohen isn’t doing plenty to keep the fires stoked himself; earlier today, the comedian—or rather, one of his characters, “Dr. Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr.”—fired back at “Vice-President Palin” on Twitter, accusing her of “being hit by a bullshit grenade” and suggesting that she’s now “bleedin’ FAKE NEWS.” It’s all perfectly funny, right-wing-baiting stuff, so why does reading it—and anticipating more of this sort of thing as the show’s run begins—make us feel so goddamn tired all of a sudden?      Advertisement      It seems weird, after all, to suggest that it hasn’t been long enough since Baron Cohen’s last reign of undercover terror. Bruno is nine years old at this point, and it’s clear that he and his team are as good as ever at working their ways into places they really aren’t supposed to be. (Case in point: This Hollywood Reporter piece about their infiltration of the show of conservative radio host Austin Rhodes, which includes a firsthand account of the tactics Cohen’s team uses to make sure their targets stay disoriented and wrong-footed.)      But here’s the thing: When Baron Cohen was first doing his thing, making a fool of Newt Gingrich and tricking people into revealing their secret prejudices for the ever-watchful camera, it was back in an era where people were at least surface-level interested in keeping those prejudices secret. But the sad fact is that we no longer need elaborate stings or disguises to prove that people like Palin or Roy Moore are small-minded, xenophobic, frequently racist idiots; these days, that’s the makings of a moderately successful political brand. It makes the comedian’s antics feel a bit like yelling that the emperor’s got no clothes on, when we’ve spent the last two years knowingly staring, dead-eyed and helpless, at his wrinkled genitals as they flop around hatefully in our face.      Advertisement      Of course, Baron Cohen has surprised us before; it’s entirely possible that his series will tease something legitimately shocking or revelatory out of his encounters with America’s political elite. Hopefully we’ll be awake to see it. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Who Is America? is a new satirical comedy series from actor Sacha Baron Cohen, who makes his return to television after a decade.

Input: This marked the first of four games against potential playoff-bound teams in the Texans, Atlanta Falcons, Buffalo Bills, and Indianapolis Colts. The Browns saw their three-game winning streak end as the Texans' defense and run game dominated the Browns in a 23-7 blowout loss. Texans DE J. J. Watt, who played tight end in high school, scored the 5th offensive TD of his career. The Browns' lone score came in the 2nd quarter. A touchdown from Brian Hoyer to Browns' receiver Andrew Hawkins tied the game at 7 in the second quarter. However, the Texans scored the final 16 points of the contest. Hoyer struggled as he was 20/50 passing for 330 yards, throwing only one touchdown while throwing a 4th quarter interception. It was only the second time this season that the Browns got shut out in the second half of a game, an event that also occurred in their 24-6 loss to the Jaguars. With the loss, the Browns fell out of 1st place in the AFC North and into a tie for 3rd place behind the Bengals and Steelers, who both won that week. Defensive linemen John Hughes and Phil Taylor were lost for the season on IR, and Jordan Cameron missed his 3rd straight game due to a concussion. On November 18, the Browns released RB Ben Tate.

In 2007, Jorjan Sarich and her dad moved from California to Idaho. It was where he wanted to live his rest time. \\"I left my occupation, I left my friends; he did the same thing,\\" said Sarich, who bought a house with her father, George Snyder, in the China Gardens neighborhood of Hailey after his health began to decline. Though a graduate student struggling to finish her dissertation , Sarich chose to be her dad's full-time caregiver. \\"It's only now, several years later, that I'm realizing how much work it was.

This myth arose as early as 1907. People have long argued about our power of self-improvement and our brains' potential abilities.

My dad left so speak with the meter maid. Meanwhile I was wondering what I should do to thank the homeless man. I didn’t have any cash and I didn’t see any ATMs. I saw my dad give the homeless man a dollar. I worried the homeless man would think we were stingy, selfish people who were so out of touch with reality that we thought giving a single dollar would make us white saviors. I didn't have cash but I did have a card. I bought him tea and 3 cookies. I made up a speech in my head to use when I gave the man his food. I kept repeating it in my head, trying emphasize how sorry I was that I didn’t have any money and that I hoped this food would be enough. My dad disappeared while I was ordering the food and I freaked out so much I forgot to apologize for not giving money. The homeless man put down my food and drinks besides 5 other drinks he'd been given before. I felt ashamed, like my pathetic efforts to help were just another unwanted item that robbed him of the chance to choose for himself with money. I got into the car with my dad and angrily asked him why he left when I asked him to stay. He didn’t care at all that I’d been calling for him or that my hot tea burned my full hands when I got bumped by someone, looking for him. I told him I was incredibly upset and he told me not to be, but I wouldn’t stop. I kept saying, “Why the hell did you leave? It messed up what I was going to say. Stop leaving me all the time!” “Use your eyes to look for me, stop freaking out,” he said. I yelled, “I made myself look like a stupid, racist, out-of-touch white bitch with a savior complex who can’t even do one thing right!” and my dad turned to me and yelled, “Shut up! Shut up and be grateful. I’m paying for everything on this trip. You shut your mouth and quit talking.” I felt so bad that I burst out crying. I cried so hard I couldn’t even speak. It was just all stupid blubbering and it made my dad yell at me, \\"Why are you crying? You have no reason to cry!\\" Finally I blubbered out in a pathetic voice, “Please just give me a minute! Just a minute, God!”  We drove down the streets and I explained how ashamed I was that I couldn’t help at all and how I failed to use my privilege to actually help another human being. He told me I didn’t care about being a good person and that I was just doing it out of guilt. I told him I was upset because I should have done more and he told me I needed to quit being upset because I helped the homeless man and I couldn’t give him everything in one interaction.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was alienated from Johnson due to doubts concerning the 1965 bombing of North Vietnam? from the following article ?  Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964...

Aaron had a job where they worked outside..","output":"It was easier for Robert than Aaron to tan because Robert had a job where they worked outside. Robert was employed as a landscape gardener, and his daily routine involved long hours outside, tending to lawns, planting flowers, and trimming hedges in various clients' gardens. Robert enjoyed his job, as it allowed him to stay active, maintain a connection with nature, and take pride in the beautiful spaces he helped create. During his lunch breaks, Robert would often remove his hat and shirt, lathering on some sunscreen to protect himself from the sun's harmful rays. Despite his efforts to stay safe, he found that over time, his skin developed a deep, glowing tan that even his sunscreen couldn't prevent. In the evenings, when he returned home after a long day of labor, Robert liked to check his ever-darkening tan in the mirror, which grew darker with every passing day of the warm summer months. Aaron, on the other hand, worked in an office as a software developer. His days were spent mostly indoors, hunched over his computer, writing lines of code, and attending virtual meetings. The only time Aaron felt the warmth of the sun on his skin was during his short walk to and from the local coffee shop for his daily caffeine fix. On a good day, Aaron might be able to squeeze in a quick half-hour outside, eating lunch in the park close to his office. Aaron envied Robert's sun-kissed glow and often wished that his own job allowed him more time outdoors. He would try to maximize his sun exposure during weekends, spending time at the beach or hiking in nearby forests, but it just wasn't enough to match the tan that Robert easily achieved. One afternoon, during a backyard barbecue at Aaron's house, the friends got to talking about their respective tans. Aaron complained about the unfairness of Robert's ability to develop such an impressive tan, while he himself remained stubbornly pale, despite his best efforts. \\"Why should you get all the good genes?\\" Aaron jokingly moaned. Robert listened sympathetically to Aaron's laments but couldn't help but feel a small swell of pride at his own healthy glow. He suggested that Aaron try to find outdoor hobbies or even consider walking or biking to work to get a little extra sun exposure. Examining their contrasting appearances, Robert stood tall with his well-toned muscles and deep tan, looking every bit the outdoor laborer that he was. Aaron, on the other hand, was slightly hunched from hours spent at his computer, his complexion still decidedly more on the pale side. Aaron took Robert's advice to heart and started spending more time outdoors, choosing to be more active during his spare time. He made a habit of going for a walk or jog every evening to catch the setting sun, and he even joined a local sports team that practiced outdoors. It took time and dedication, but eventually, Aaron was able to build a tan of his own, although it never quite matched Robert's bronzed hue. Despite their differing abilities to tan, Aaron and Robert remained close friends. Over the years, they enjoyed their outdoor pursuits together, each understanding and valuing the strengths and characteristics that made them unique. And while their tans faded with the seasons, the bond between them remained strong, glowing brighter with each passing summer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Strikes in Łódź continued until mid-1906, when the large Russian military presence and mass layoffs of striking workers from the factories finally pacified the city. Even afterward, Łódź was not a peaceful city; in the years 1910-1914 it was the site of a radical, anarchist and socialist group Rewolucyjni Mściciele labeled as \\"the most extreme, terrorist group in the history of Poland\\".

Article: Brooklyn Park man charged in Gambian coup plot      Papa Faal's home in Minnesota Kia Farhang / AP      Federal prosecutors have charged a Brooklyn Park man with conspiring to overthrow the government of Gambia in West Africa.      Papa Faal, 46, is charged with conspiring to violate the Neutrality Act by making an expedition against a friendly nation from the United States and conspiring to possess firearms to commit violence.      Faal, who told investigators that he has served in the U.S. Army and Air Force, made his first court appearance Monday in Minneapolis. Another man, Cherno Njie, 57, appeared in court in Baltimore.      Federal prosecutors say Faal was part of a group of 10 to 12 men, most from the United States and Europe, who traveled to their native Gambia to carry out the coup attempt. Some had served in the U.S. or Gambian armies and are skilled shooters.      According to the criminal complaint, the men sent weapons to Gambia, including semi-automatic rifles that Faal shipped there in 50-gallon barrels.      On Dec. 30, Faal and the other fighters gathered in the woods near the presidential palace, aiming to storm the building and force the turnover of the government. The soldiers guarding the complex fired on them, killing several of the dissidents.      Papa Faal Courtesy of the Nigerian News      Faal, a dual citizen of the United States and Gambia, told agents that even though it had been 23 years since he lived in Gambia, he still had family there \\"and felt a connection to his people.\\"      According to the complaint, the group wanted to restore democracy to Gambia and improve the lives of its people.      Faal told investigators he was first approached in August and agreed to join the movement because he became disenchanted with the way the Gambian president was rigging elections and because of his concerns for the plight of the Gambian people, according to the complaint.      Over the next few months, the members of the group talked over the phone, had secret planning documents they shared with one another online, but rarely met in person. Faal told investigators they knew each other only by their code names.      Prosecutors say Njie, a businessman in Austin, Texas who is a U.S. citizen, financed the operation. The group purchased thousands of dollars in weapons. Njie was to be installed as the interim leader of Gambia if the coup was successful.      Faal told Magistrate Judge Franklin Noel that he is an instructor at ITT Technical Institute in Minneapolis. He's married and has one daughter, a friend said.      This is not the first time that Minnesota has seen such a charge.      The one that maybe bears the most resemblance is the case against Gen. Vang Pao, the late Hmong leader. In 2007, the U.S. government charged Vang Pao and nine others with plotting to overthrow the Lao government.      The controversial prosecution prompted protests across the nation and in the Twin Cities. Two years later, federal authorities dropped all of the charges against Vang Pao.      Map      Editor's note (Jan. 8, 2014): Due to incorrect information provided by federal prosecutors, the original version of this story misidentified Papa Faal's current city.

Attorney General Eric Holder (Photo: Tony Dejak, AP)      WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors have charged two U.S. men in connection with a violent failed coup attempt against the government of Gambia last month in an alleged conspiracy that included an undisclosed number of other Americans.      Cherno Njie, 57, a U.S. citizen of Gambian descent living in Texas, and Papa Faal, 46, a citizen of both the U.S. and Gambia living in Minnesota, were named in a unusual criminal complaint made public Monday that outlined a months-long conspiracy in which firearms, including semi-automatic rifles, were allegedly shipped to the West African nation for use in the failed overthrow.      Several of the assailants died in the Dec. 30 failed assault on the residence of Gambian President Yahya Jammeh. It was not immediately clear how many were killed and whether the dead included other Americans.      In a video posted on the Gambian government's website, Jammeh said the assault was carried out by \\"dissidents'' based in Germany, the U.S. and Great Britain.      Jammeh was photographed next to a flatbed truck that displayed an array of firearms reportedly seized in the attack.      \\"I live for the Gambia,'' Jammeh said. \\"I die for the Gambia.''      Njie, an Austin businessman, is described in federal court documents as the financier and leader of the alleged conspiracy who was expected to serve as the \\"interim leader'' of the government had the coup succeeded.      Faal, of Brooklyn Center, Minn., reportedly told federal investigators following his arrest that he had served in both the U.S. Air Force and Army, before his Army discharge in 2012. He joined the coup attempt, according to court documents, because he had become \\"disenchanted by the way the president was rigging elections and because of his concerns with the plight of the Gambian people.''      Both suspects are charged with conspiring to violate the Neutrality Act for their alleged actions against a friendly nation and conspiring to possess firearms in furtherance of a crime of violence. The two made brief, separate court appearances Monday. Njie did not challenge his detention in a Baltimore federal court. He will be moved to Minneapolis where the case will be prosecuted, federal officials said. A similar hearing was held for Faal in Minneapolis.      \\"These defendants stand accused of conspiring to carry out the violent overthrow of a foreign government, in violation of U.S. law,\\" said Attorney General Eric Holder. \\"The United States strongly condemns such conspiracies. With these serious charges, the United States is committed to holding them fully responsible for their actions.\\"      Up to a dozen members of the conspiracy, according to court documents, entered Gambia earlier this year, expecting that others, including a battalion of sympathetic Gambian soldiers, would join their side. Before their departures, which occurred between August and October, Faal and other conspirators allegedly purchased the firearms and shipped them to Gambia. The group also acquired night-vision goggles, body armor, ammunition, black military-style uniform pants, boots and other equipment.      An estimated 30 firearms were shipped to Gambia, some of them hidden in 50-gallon barrels containing clothing, the court documents stated.      \\"Faal admitted he knew shipping the guns was illegal, but was more concerned with carrying out the coup,'' the documents stated.      On Dec. 30, according to the complaint, Faal and other conspirators allegedly gathered in the woods near the home of the Gambian president in Banjul where they split into two teams.      At that time, prosecutors allege that Njie was waiting at a secure location until the teams took control of the home. The teams, however, were allegedly routed by heavy fire from guard towers when they approached, resulting in the deaths of several conspirators.      Faal and Njie fled, returning to the U.S., where they were arrested.

And there may have been more Americans—and possibly more American veterans—involved, based on statements given to an FBI agent by Papa Faal, the vet whose alleged role in the plot involved smuggling weapons into Gambia.      “Most, if not all, members of the group had served in the U.S. or Gambian military,” Faal told FBI agent Nicholas Marshall, according to an affidavit.      While Faal appeared in a Minnesota courtroom, his alleged co-conspirator, Gambian-American Cherno Njie, stood before a Baltimore judge. The two had been working together since August, but Faal may have only recently learned the name of Njie, the would-be ruler of Gambia.      “The members of the group were known to each other by code names,” Marshall’s affidavit noted. Faal’s code name was “Fox.”      The Pentagon said Faal served in the Air Force for seven years, during which time he became a U.S. citizen. He later spent three years in the Army, starting with training at Georgia’s Fort Benning and serving as a sergeant during an 11-month deployment to Afghanistan in 2011, Army officials confirmed.      Faal told the FBI that his group was trying “restore democracy to The Gambia and improve the lives of its people.”      Believing they had “up to 160 members of the local Gambian military” on their side and that the president’s guards wouldn’t risk their lives to defend him, the coup members “hoped they would be able to take over the country without having to kill any Gambians,” according to Faal.      Faal has some experience in both political and security matters, it seems. The Amazon biography for an author named Papa Faal mentions both Gambia and lists a military record that matches the FBI report.      “Papa Faal is from the Gambia, West Africa. He served in the United States military for 10 years, spending seven years of his service in the United States Air Force with the 459th ARW, and three years in the United States Army with the 201st Brigade Support Battalion. He culminated his military service with a tour in Afghanistan.”      Faal’s book, A Week of Hell: How Rebels Shattered the Innocence and Peace of a Nation—One Family's Story of Survival, details the bloody consequences of a previous attempt to take over Gambia’s government.      A Week of Hell recounts the events of 1981, when, as the book recounts, “a gang of rebels took over the [Gambian] government and held the president’s wife and children… hostage while releasing the country’s most dangerous prisoners to inflict a frenzy of carnage and chaos.”      Faal evades easy categorizations. He is an American and a Gambian, a published author of political history working on his doctorate, and a U.S. Army and Air Force veteran. But those strands of his identity are all wound around the conspiracy that led him back to Gambia for the first time in 23 years.      Gambia’s current president, Yahya Jammeh, was a junior military officer when he took power after leading his own coup in 1994. For the past 18 years, Jammeh has commemorated the date of his coup, which overthrew a democratically elected government, with a national celebration.      The man seeking to depose Jammeh, Gambian-American Texas businessman Njie, was known to Faal by his code name “Dave” during their months of planning. Njie has no obvious qualifications for running a country, but a search of his apartment by the FBI turned up evidence of his planning.      Along with a spreadsheet logging weapons purchases and other expenses, investigators found two documents. One was a handwritten note “that appears to describe the author’s vision for The Gambia following a transition in political power.” A second document was titled: “Gambia Reborn: A Charter for Transition from Dictatorship to Democracy and Development.”      A November 2014 profile of Njie by the editor of the Texas-based newspaper The Gambia Echo & Tribune begins with a quote from Shakespeare and proceeds to greater heights of reverence. Njie is a “serious fellow with a very sharp intellect, unassuming, attentive, calm and calculating but equally shrewd and lucid and above all, highly disciplined and introspective with a penchant for academic and political discourse.” He’s also the “CEO and owner of dual multimillion-dollar Austin-based companies,” a source of Gambian pride, and an exemplar of American exceptionalism, according to the article.      While “Dave” handled money and orchestrated between the various plotters, unknown to each other, Faal’s job was getting guns to Gambia.      Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

Faal legally purchased M4 semi-automatic rifles—the same model used by the U.S. Army—hid them in barrels stuffed with clothing, and shipped them to Gambia under an alias. Another member of the plot took care of the ammo along with black uniforms, night-vision equipment, and body armor.      The various members met for the first time when they traveled to Gambia at the beginning of December to carry out their plan. There, according to Faal’s account to the FBI, they acted like a group with some military experience. They conducted reconnaissance and dry runs, and adjusted their plans when they got new intelligence about the president’s whereabouts.      The conspirators were split into two teams, “Alpha” and “Bravo.” Alpha was to storm the State House, where they expected the president to be on New Year’s Day, and Bravo was to secure the rear of the building. Their leader, Njie, still going by “Dave” during the operation, would stay a safe distance away until the State House was secure.      As it happened, the coup members found the State House “fortified with additional soldiers.” When an Alpha Team member fired a shot in the air meant to scare off the guards whom they didn’t expect to put up much of a fight, they took “heavy fire from the guard towers.”      From there the plan went to hell. Alpha Team was killed, Faal told the FBI, while the Bravo members who were not gunned down fled. While Faal and Njie are in U.S. custody, the whereabouts of the other survivors is unknown.      Gambia’s president, Jammeh, has denied there was any coup attempt. He called the events last week “an attack by dissidents based in the U.S., Germany, and U.K.,” and pointed to U.S.-made weapons involved in the plot.      Jammeh is known for making wild claims. In 2007 he said he had discovered a cure for AIDS using natural herbs. But his account of a dissident plot involving Gambian expats using U.S. weapons is similar to what Faal told the FBI. Most coup members “lived in the diaspora in the United States and Germany,” Faal said. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A Brooklyn Park man named Papa Faal, who is a dual citizen of the United States and Gambia, and has served in the U.S. Army and Air Force, was charged along with Texas property developer and U.S. citizen Cherno Njie for conspiring to overthrow the Gambian government. Federal prosecutors argue that Faal was part of a group of 10-12 men, most from the United States and Europe, who traveled to their native Gambia to carry out the coup attempt. According to the criminal complaint, the men sent weapons to Gambia, including semi-automatic rifles that Faal shipped there in 50-gallon barrels. The goal of the coup was to restore democracy to Gambia and improve the lives of its people. Faal told investigators that he joined the movement because he became disenchanted with the way the Gambian president was rigging elections and was concerned for the Gambian people's well-being. Prosecutors claim that Njie, a businessman in Austin, Texas, financed the operation and was set to be installed as the interim leader of Gambia if the coup was successful."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: -  These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process described is the colonization of an area by pioneer plants, such as lichens, mosses, and small grasses. This typically occurs in areas where the soil quality is poor or where a natural disturbance, like fire or erosion, has cleared away the previous plant population. As these pioneer plants grow, they help to stabilize the soil, suppress erosion, and provide shelter for nearby organisms. When they die, their decomposition adds organic material to the soil, thus improving its nutrient content and texture. This, in turn, makes the area more fertile, eventually allowing for the growth of larger plants and ultimately leading to the succession of forests or other more complex ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.  and the situation: The Gorge saw some negative effects due to deforestation. The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon.  Answer the following question: Which area experiences less soil erosion? Answer:","output":"The area that experiences less soil erosion is the Valley.  The first step in arriving at this answer is to analyze the given background and situation information. Let's break down the characteristics of both the degraded land and the Valley in separate points for better understanding. Degraded land: 1. Declining biodiversity 2. Less adaptable to disasters 3. Smaller food supply for animals 4. Poor soil quality with low nutrients like water, nitrogen, and carbon 5. Increased frequency of dust storms due to degradation 6. Soil erosion becomes a bigger problem due to fewer plants to anchor the soil Valley: 1. More fertile soil 2. Not overgrazed 3. Abundant trees and bushes 4. Increased productivity over the past decade 5. Varied biodiversity 6. Nutritious soil that retains more water, nitrogen, and carbon By comparing these two sets of characteristics, we can determine that the Valley has a healthier ecosystem, with more fertile soil, better biodiversity, and an overall more stable environment. These factors contribute to a lower risk of soil erosion in the Valley compared to the degraded land. The degraded land, on the other hand, is more susceptible to soil erosion due to its low plant population and poor soil quality, which make it difficult for the soil to remain firm and stable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is bounded to the north by Loch Scridain and to the south by the Firth of Lorne. The main villages are Bunessan and Fionnphort, with smaller settlements including Ardtun, Camas, Carsaig, Knockan, Pennyghael and Uisken. Knocknafenaig, Suidhe, and Shiaba are three of the many cleared settlements on the Ross.  - Fionnphort ( English pronunciation : / fnfrt / , Scottish Gaelic pronunciation : ( fjunafrt ) ) is the principal port of the Ross of Mull , and the second largest settlement in the area ( its population is approximately 80 ) . The village 's name is the anglicised pronunciation of the gaelic for \`\` White Port '' and previous names have included Coal Idhe , gaelic for \`\` Sound of Iona '' .  - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role.  - Bunessan is a small village on the Ross of Mull in the south-west of the island of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland. The settlement is within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon, and is situated on the A849.  - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile).  - Saint Columba ('church dove'; 7 December 521  9 June 597) was an Irish abbot and missionary credited with spreading Christianity in what is today Scotland at the start of the Hiberno-Scottish mission. He founded the important abbey on Iona, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of Derry. He was highly regarded by both the Gaels of Dál Riata and the Picts, and is remembered today as a Christian saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland.  - Iona is a small island in the Inner Hebrides off the Ross of Mull on the western coast of Scotland. It was a centre of Gaelic monasticism for four centuries and is today renowned for its tranquility and natural beauty. It is a popular tourist destination and a place for retreats. Its modern Gaelic name means \\"Iona of (Saint) Columba\\" (formerly anglicised \\"Icolmkill\\").  - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland.

The settlement is within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon.  - Ardtun is a settlement on the Isle of Mull, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. Ardtun is within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon.  - Knocknafenaig is a ruined township on the Isle of Mull, Scotland.  - In economics, cargo or freight are goods or produce being conveyed  generally for commercial gain  by ship, boat, or aircraft, although the term is now often extended to cover all types of freight, including that carried by train, van, truck, or intermodal container. The term cargo is also used in case of goods in the cold-chain, because the perishable inventory is always in transit towards a final end-use, even when it is held in cold storage or other similar climate-controlled facility.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - Knockan is a township of six crofts in the community of Ardtun, in the south of the island of Mull off the west coast of Scotland.  - A harbor or harbour (see spelling differences), or haven, is a body of water where ships, boats and barges seek shelter from stormy weather, or are stored for future use. Harbors and ports are often confused with each other. A port is a manmade facility built for loading and unloading vessels and dropping off and picking up passengers. Ports are often located \\"in\\" harbors.  - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides.

From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process. But, to avoid hurting anyone you love, you should definitely talk to a counselor if you are looking for another person to help you :) For family members/lovers/caregivers, it's stressful and often results in a lot of resentment in the relationship!

People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not.  But I can use this background: Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as sink hole formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.  What is an answer for this question: Will Reslie need to replace their levees sooner or later than Tichago Answer:","output":"Given the information you provided, it can be inferred that the city of Reslie will likely need to replace their levees sooner than Tichago. The presence of soil piping in Reslie can cause levee and dam failure. This is a form of soil erosion that occurs beneath the soil surface and leads to the weakening and eventual failure of structures like levees and dams. The turbulent flow involved in soil piping erodes away soil, gradually compromising the structural integrity of these constructions. On the other hand, Tichago does not have a reported soil piping problem, which indicates its levees are presumably not being subjected to the same erosive forces that Reslie's are. While it is not explicitly discussed, if Tichago does have levees, they will presumably last longer against structural failure in the absence of soil piping. However, it's important to note that this answer assumes that the only factor affecting the lifespan of the levees in both cities is soil piping. There could be other environmental, soil, or human-induced factors at play that were not mentioned, such as the soil salinity described in your background information. High soil salinity can also compromise the structural integrity of constructions like levees and dams. But based on the information you provided, we do not know if either city is dealing with significant soil salinity issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

His brother, who is married to an American woman in Los Angeles, is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers third-degree burns, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a tramp steamer headed for the U.S. Meanwhile, the Legion Commandant travels to Paris, arriving at the government Consulate, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant suggests sending two of his own men to bring Gaultier back, which is approved. Lyon arrives pennyless in New York City and is attracted to an illegal street fighting match that is being run by a New Yorker called Joshua, a man who runs fights for money. Gaultier steps forward to take part in the next fight and destroys his opponent, leaving Joshua looking astounded at what he just saw. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him.

TfL said it was seeking interest from industry to help supply the onboard speed monitoring systems. Union Aslef welcomed the new system but said it was \\"belated\\". An investigation by the Rail Accidents Investigation Branch (RAIB) found the crashed tram had been travelling at 43.5mph in a 12mph zone and found no evidence of any track defects or obstructions.

Previously they had been regarded as buses on tracks. Now they are being moved into the realm of light rail with tighter safety measures. Safety has been in the spotlight since the Croydon disaster but there have also been a number of reports of tram drivers falling asleep at the controls.

Sentence 2: Beijing abuses its power towards Hong Kong. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is true based on the first sentence, let's break down the information provided: 1. The first sentence introduces the idea that international attention is an important check against any abuse of power by Beijing toward Hong Kong. This suggests that external monitoring can potentially deter Beijing from engaging in aggressive actions. Nevertheless, the sentence does not explicitly confirm nor deny whether Beijing is actually abusing its power at the moment. 2. The second sentence plainly states that Beijing abuses its power towards Hong Kong. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these two sentences: - If Sentence 1 is true (meaning international attention is an important check against abuse of power), it does NOT automatically determine the truthfulness of Sentence 2 (whether Beijing is abusing its power or not).

President Barack Obama's approval rating is now at 41 percent, according to a new poll. That's five percent down from where it was just a month ago. Dissatisfaction with the President's signature healthcare law continues to play a large role in Americans' disgruntlement with the President. Support for Obamacare is also down five percent from last month.

This marks a significant five percent drop from just a month ago. A key contributor to this decline appears to be the ongoing dissatisfaction with the President's signature healthcare law, Obamacare, which has also seen a five percent decline in support over the last month. Step 1: Discuss the poll results To create a comprehensive understanding of the poll results, it is essential to highlight the key figures, such as President Obama's approval rating of 41 percent and the five percent drop in support for Obamacare. This will enable readers to visualize how the President's popularity has declined in this short span of time. Step 2: Address the connection between the approval rating and Obamacare The ongoing dissatisfaction with Obamacare is reportedly playing a substantial role in shaping American's disgruntlement with President Obama. By connecting the decrease in the President's approval rating to the diminishing support for Obamacare, readers can understand the possible reasons behind the decline in popularity. Step 3: Analyze the reasons for dissatisfaction with Obamacare In order to provide a thorough analysis of the situation, it is vital to discuss the reasons behind the dissatisfaction with Obamacare. Issues such as high insurance premiums, limited provider networks, or shortcomings in the system's design might be contributing factors to the dissatisfaction of the public. By addressing these concerns, readers can gain insight into the public's disappointment with the healthcare law. Step 4: Highlight the consequences of a low approval rating It is important to discuss the potential consequences of these poll results for President Obama's legacy and policy initiatives. A low approval rating could signal difficulty in gaining support for future legislation or making significant changes. It might also impact the Democratic Party's chances in upcoming elections if voters are not satisfied with the President's performance. Conclusion:  President Barack Obama's approval rating has seen a notable decline, dropping to 41 percent. A major factor in this decline is the dissatisfaction with his signature healthcare law, Obamacare, which has led to the erosion of public support. As the dissatisfaction with Obamacare persists, the potential impact on the President's legacy and policy initiatives remains uncertain. It is crucial for the administration to address these concerns in order to regain the trust of the American people and secure the future success of the President's agenda."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who told Bernhard Cossmann to \\"listen to the instrumentation\\" and claimed it was his own? from the following article ?  While Raff was able to offer \\"practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt\\", there may have been \\"a basic misunderstanding\\" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions.

Given these facts, what can chemical splashing cause to humans among the following options: - death  - pain  - pleasure  - birth  - satisfaction  - cancer  - deadly  - Injury Answer:","output":"Chemical splashing can cause significant harm to humans, particularly if the chemicals involved are hazardous or corrosive substances. Among the given options, chemical splashing can potentially cause: 1. Death: In some severe cases, chemical splashing can lead to death, especially when the chemicals in question are highly toxic. When these harmful substances come into contact with the skin, eyes, or respiratory system, they can cause chemical burns, respiratory failure, or systemic poisoning. Immediate medical attention is essential in such life-threatening situations. 2. Pain: Chemical splashing can cause acute pain and discomfort when the skin or eyes come into contact with hazardous substances. The chemicals may cause burning sensations or irritation, leading to significant physical distress. Depending on the nature of the chemical exposure, the severity of the pain can range from mild to unbearable. 3. Cancer: Certain chemicals are known to be carcinogens, which means they are capable of causing cancer in living tissues. Prolonged or repeated exposure to such chemicals may increase the risk of developing cancer. So, while an isolated incident of chemical splashing may not directly cause cancer, it can indirectly contribute to long-term health risks. 4. Injury: Injuries are a common and direct consequence of chemical splashing. When harmful chemicals come into contact with the skin, eyes, or other body parts, they may cause chemical burns, lacerations, or irreversible tissue damage. The severity of the injury depends upon the type, concentration, and amount of chemical involved, as well as the length of exposure time and the individual's susceptibility. 5. Deadly: \\"Deadly\\" is similar to \\"death\\" in this context, as it implies that chemical splashing can have severe, life-threatening consequences if not treated promptly and appropriately. The term \\"deadly\\" emphasizes the potential for severe outcomes due to chemical exposure and reinforces the importance of proper handling and safety precautions when working with hazardous substances. While chemical splashing can cause death, pain, cancer, injury, and be deadly, it is important to note that it is unlikely to cause pleasure, birth, or satisfaction. These terms are unrelated to the potential hazards associated with chemical exposure and do not adequately describe the consequences of chemical splashing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: I'd not noticed this until someone drew my attention to it, but the latest IMF Fiscal Monitor, published last month, comes about as close to declaring Spain insolvent as you are ever likely to see in official analysis of this sort. Of course, it doesn't actually say this outright. The IMF is far too diplomatic for such language. But that's the plain meaning of its latest forecasts, which at last have an air of realism about them, rather than being the usual dose of wishful thinking. Let's take the projected budget deficit first. This is expected to decline quite steeply this year to 6.6 per cent of GDP, but that's mainly because the cost of bailing out the banking sector fell substantially on last year's budget. On a like-for-like basis, there has in fact been very little fall in the underlying deficit. And nor on the present policy mix is there ever likely to be, for that's where the deficit is projected to remain until the end of the IMF's forecasting horizon in 2018. Next year, the deficit is expected to be 6.9 per cent, the year after 6.6 per cent, and so on with very little further progress thereafter. Remember, all these projections are made on the basis of everything we know about policy so far, so they take account of the latest package of austerity measures announced by the Spanish Government. The situation looks even worse on a cyclically adjusted basis. What is sometimes called the \\"structural deficit\\", or the bit of government borrowing that doesn't go away even after the economy returns to growth (if indeed it ever does), actually deteriorates from an expected 4.2 per cent of GDP this year to 5.7 per cent in 2018. By 2018, Spain has far and away the worst structural deficit of any advanced economy, including other such well known fiscal basket cases as the UK and the US. So what happens when you carry on borrowing at that sort of rate, year in, year out? Your overall indebtedness rockets, of course, and that's what's going to happen to Spain, where general government gross debt is forecast to rise from 84.1 per cent of GDP last year to 110.6 per cent in 2018. No other advanced economy has such a dramatically worsening outlook. And the tragedy of it all is that Spain is actually making relatively good progress in addressing the \\"primary balance\\", that's the deficit before debt servicing costs. What's projected to occur is essentially what happens in all bankruptcies. Eventually you have to borrow more just to pay the interest on your existing debt. The fiscal compact requires eurozone countries to reduce their deficits to 3 per cent by the end of this year, though Spain among others was recently granted an extension. But on these numbers, there is no chance ever of achieving this target without further austerity measures, which even if they were attempted would very likely be self defeating. IN any case, it seems doubtful an economy where unemployment is already above 25 per cent could take any more. In the past, the IMF has been guilty of being far too optimistic about Spain, both on the outlook for growth and the public finances, so it's possible it is now committing the reverse mistake of undue pessimism. Yet somehow I doubt it. Spain is chasing its tail down into deflationary oblivion. All this leads to the conclusion that a big Spanish debt restructuring is inevitable. Spanish sovereign bond yields have fallen sharply since announcement of the European Central Bank's \\"outright monetary transactions\\" programme. The ECB has promised to print money without limit to counter the speculators. But in the end, no amount of liquidity can cover up for an underlying problem with solvency. Europe said that Greece was the first and last such restructuring, but then there was Cyprus. Spain is holding off further recapitalisation of its banks in anticipation of the arrival of Europe's banking union, which it hopes will do the job instead. But if the Cypriot precedent is anything to go by, a heavy price will be demanded by way of recompense. Bank creditors will be widely bailed in. Confiscation of deposits looks all too possible. I don't advise getting your money out lightly. Indeed, such advise is generally thought grossly irresponsible, for it risks inducing a self reinforcing panic. Yet looking at the IMF projections, it's the only rational thing to do. PS. I don't include creditors of the British arm of Santander in this warning, who are ring fenced from the mothership back bome in Spain, theoretically at least.

Since 1993 the band's longest serving members are vocalist Karl Buechner, guitarist Scott Crouse, bassist Ian Edwards and drummer Dennis Merrick. Their third guitarist Erick Edwards joined the band in 1998. The band has released eight studio albums, three compilations, two live albums and six music videos. Context: Although ideologically tied to the straight edge movement, the initial musical influences of Earth Crisis were mainly from New York hardcore bands such as Agnostic Front, Cro-Mags and Sick Of It All. After the All Out War EP, they developed an increasingly technical and heavier style, citing death metal bands Napalm Death, Bolt Thrower and Obituary as prime inspirations. Buechner's vocals became rougher with each release as well, culminating in the completely gutturally screamed Gomorrah's Season Ends. Terrorizer magazine referred to this album as \\"heavy hardcore taken to a new level, all the blackness that was hinted at on Firestorm realized in all its formidable glory.\\" In this period, many of their songs were built on Merrick's drum beats.  Their third studio album, Breed the Killers, maintained the previous aggressiveness and its growled vocals were \\"taken about as far as possible\\", but it followed a structure more akin to the \\"post-Judge hardcore of the Path of Resistance record Who Dares Wins\\", according to Shawn Macomber of Decibel. Dennis Merrick said: \\"On Breed the Killers I think we achieved the most honest representation of our sound without sounding too raw or too slick\\". Its follow-up, Slither, had a change of style that steered towards nu metal. Buechner declared that, rather than being influenced by other styles, they \\"resurrected\\" the sound of All Out War in a proper way, which also had melodic choruses and spoken word verses.  Their first post-reunion album, To the Death, was described by Buechner as \\"a mixture between Destroying the Machines and Breed the Killers.\\" According to Stereo Killer, it was \\"arguably the band's heaviest offering\\" but with \\"more traditional verse/chorus/verse\\" material. Neutralize the Threat followed a similar path, but \\"with a Gomorrah's Season Ends vibe thrown in\\", the band stated. Scott Crouse said that he always tried \\"to get the perfect blend of heaviness, imagery and listenability\\" and that these two albums were the first to \\"hit that mark\\". Salvation of Innocents included, in addition, some clean vocals that were compared by one reviewer to the sludge metal band Crowbar, as well as \\"some elements of European melodic metalcore\\" and faster songs.  When asked what ten bands inspired Earth Crisis over the years in a 2016 interview, Scott Crouse named DYS, Judge, Corrosion of Conformity, Agnostic Front, Slayer, Sepultura, Metallica, Conviction, Zero Tolerance and Iron Maiden. Question: what is the most interesting part of this article, in your opinion?. Whats the answer?","output":"The most interesting part of this article, in my opinion, is how Earth Crisis's music evolved over time, influenced by different styles and bands. They started with New York hardcore influences, then developed a heavier, more technical sound inspired by death metal bands, and later incorporated elements of nu metal, melodic metalcore, and sludge metal. It's fascinating to see how their music changed while they still remained true to their core message and beliefs."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Instructions: In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the general math. Classify your answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Input: Problem: how many integerskgreater than 100 and less than 1200 are there such that if the hundreds and the units digits ofkare reversed , the resulting integer is k + 99 ?  Options: a ) 50 , b ) 60 , c ) 70 , d ) 80 , e ) 100 Output:","output":"Let's work step-by-step and analyze the given problem: 1. We have an integer k, which is greater than 100 and less than 1200. 2. If the hundreds and the units digits of k are reversed, then k will become a new number. Let's represent the hundreds and units digits by h and u, respectively. So, k = 100h + 10t + u, where t is the tens digit. 3. When the hundreds and the units digits are reversed, the new number will be 100u + 10t + h. 4. The problem states that the resulting integer, when hundreds and units digits are reversed, is equal to k + 99. So, 100u + 10t + h = 100h + 10t + u + 99. Now, let's simplify and solve the equation: 100u + 10t + h - 100h - 10t - u = 99 99u - 99h = 99 u - h = 1 Now that we have a simplified equation (u - h = 1), let's evaluate the possible answers: Since k is between 100 and 1200, there are possibilities for hundreds digit (h) ranging from 1 to 11. Given u - h = 1, the units digit (u) will be one greater than the hundreds digit (h). For each of the hundreds digits from 1 to 11, there is a possibility of a single digit for units digit i.e u = h+1. The tens digit (t) can range from 0 to 9. Now, let's calculate the total number of possibilities: Number of possibilities for h = 11 (1 to 11) Number of possibilities for u = 1 (u = h+1) Number of possibilities for t = 10 (0 to 9) Total possibilities = 11 (h possibilities) * 1 (u possibilities) * 10 (t possibilities) = 110 However, we must remember that h can't be 11 (because it will result in a number greater than 1200). So, we have to subtract the additional possibilities, considering the case when h = 11: Additional possibilities when h = 11 = 1 (u possibility when h = 11) * 10 (t possibilities) = 10 Now, let's subtract the additional possibilities from the total possibilities: Final possibilities = 110 (total possibilities) - 10 (additional possibilities) = 100 Hence, the correct answer is e) 100."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bush administration in its first months faced many problems other than terrorism. They included the collapse of the Middle East peace process and, in April, a crisis over a U.S.\\" spy plane\\" brought down in Chinese territory. The new administration also focused heavily on Russia, a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile defenses, Europe, Mexico, and the Persian Gulf. In the spring, reporting on terrorism surged dramatically. In chapter 8, we will explore this reporting and the ways agencies responded. These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the President and top officials, became part of the context in which the new administration weighed its options for policy on al Qaeda. Except for a few reports that the CSG considered and apparently judged to be unreliable, none of these pointed specifically to possible al Qaeda action inside the United States-although the CSG continued to be concerned about the domestic threat. The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the Counterterrorist Center, which collected only abroad. Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the FBI. Clarke had expressed concern about an al Qaeda presence in the United States, and he worried about an attack on the White House by \\"Hizbollah, Hamas, al Qida and other terrorist organizations.\\" In May, President Bush announced that Vice President Cheney would himself lead an effort looking at preparations for managing a possible attack by weapons of mass destruction and at more general problems of national preparedness. The next few months were mainly spent organizing the effort and bringing an admiral from the Sixth Fleet back to Washington to manage it. The Vice President's task force was just getting under way when the 9/11 attack occurred.  Question: \\"What types of reporting surged, did the CSG deem all of the reports reliable?\\" Answer: \\"No\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer to the question is correct.

This is some data: Ariane 5, launchSite, ELA-3. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided pertains to Ariane 5, a heavy-lift launch vehicle that is part of the Ariane rocket family. It also refers to the launch site ELA-3, which is short for Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 3. In this detailed description, we will delve into the history, development, technical specifications, and the primary launch site for Ariane 5. 1. Ariane 5: Ariane 5 is a European expendable launch system designed and developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Ariane Group, a joint venture of CNES and Airbus Defence and Space. It is the fifth generation of the Ariane rocket family and has been in service since 1996. The primary goals behind the development of Ariane 5 were to deliver increased payload capacity, improved reliability and cost efficiency, and be compatible with a broader range of missions. Ariane 5 is primarily used for launching communication satellites into geostationary transfer orbits (GTO), but is also capable of launching payloads to low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), polar orbits, and interplanetary missions. The Ariane 5 has two primary configurations:   a. Ariane 5 ECA (Evolution Cryotechnique type A): This is the most powerful version of Ariane 5, with a payload capacity of up to 10.5 metric tons to GTO.   b. Ariane 5 ES (Evolution Storable): This version is designed for various types of missions and has a slightly lower GTO payload capacity of up to 8 metric tons. 2. Technical Specifications: The Ariane 5 rocket is a two-stage vehicle, utilizing a cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) main stage referred to as the EPC (Étage Principal Cryotechnique) and a solid rocket booster stage. - Main Stage: The EPC is equipped with the updated Vulcain 2 rocket engine. The main stage has a height of 30.5 meters and a diameter of 5.4 meters. It carries approximately 175 metric tons of LH2 and LOX as fuel. - Solid Rocket Boosters: Ariane 5 employs two solid rocket boosters (EAP - Étages d'Accélération à Poudre) that are connected to the EPC. Each booster is approximately 31.6 meters in height with a diameter of 3.06 meters. The combination of EPC and the two solid rocket boosters delivers efficient lift-off and stage separation, allowing for the transportation of heavy payloads into orbit. 3. Launch Site: ELA-3 Ensemble de Lancement Ariane 3, or ELA-3, is a dedicated launch facility for the Ariane 5 rocket located at the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, near Kourou. The Guiana Space Center was chosen due to its proximity to the equator, which provides a performance advantage during launch, impeccable safety measures, and seclusion. ELA-3 was specifically designed and built for Ariane 5 operations starting in the 1990s. ELA-3 comprises several key elements for a successful Ariane 5 launch:   a. The Launch Control Center (LCC): This houses the control systems and technical teams that oversee all pre-launch activities for the Ariane 5, from assembly to countdown sequences.   b. Launcher Integration Building (BIL): The first stage of the integration process occurs here, including assembly of the main stage and the attachment of solid boosters.   c. Final Assembly Building (BAF): The payload, spacecraft, and final integration occur in this building, after which the Ariane 5 is moved to the launch zone.   d. The Launch Zone (ZL): This is the actual launch site, where the fully integrated Ariane 5 rocket is prepared for liftoff. In conclusion, the data provided, Ariane 5 and ELA-3 launch site, describes a highly efficient and reliable heavy-lift launch system designed for a wide range of space applications. Since its introduction, Ariane 5 has played a significant role in global space programs and is considered a cornerstone of European space efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. Who should break weight loss down into long term goals? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - not enough information - The author. - The Mayo Clinic. - A dieter.

While the speaker does not explicitly state their beliefs about whether gerbils like to be handled, their explicit statement about their attitude towards gerbils offers a basis to infer their opinion on the hypothesis \\"I do not think gerbils like to be handled.\\" The speaker's description of gerbils being \\"kind of something you look at\\" can imply that they have a passive interaction approach with these animals. This may lead us to hypothesize that the speaker believes gerbils are not pets meant for handling. Their perspective on gerbils fits within the general attitude of the original hypothesis. At the same time, it is important to note that the premise does not provide concrete evidence regarding the speaker's opinion on gerbils' preference for handling. It merely gives us information about their personal approach to pet ownership, specifically focusing on gerbils as pets that may not require frequent human interaction. The speaker could be projecting their own preference for low-maintenance pets onto gerbils as a species, possibly indicating that their perspective is more about their personal desire for minimal interaction than it is about gerbils' handling preferences. In conclusion, the premise gives us an insight into the speaker's view on pet ownership and their perception of gerbils as pets more suitable for observation rather than handling. While this may partially align with the hypothesis \\"I do not think gerbils like to be handled,\\" specific information about the speaker's belief regarding gerbils' handling preferences is not provided. Therefore, we cannot definitively claim that the premise entails the hypothesis. However, we can infer that the speaker's perspective on pet ownership and gerbils is somewhat consistent with the underlying sentiments expressed in the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Answer:","output":"Blood flows into the kidney through the renal artery. The renal artery is a crucial component of the renal circulation system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood filtration and blood pressure within the kidneys. This artery branches off from the abdominal aorta and transports oxygen-rich blood into the kidney for filtration, reabsorption, and secretion processes. The renal artery then connects to the network of capillaries inside the kidney, which are closely associated with nephrons, the functional units of the kidneys responsible for filtration and urine formation. As the blood flows through the renal artery and into these capillaries, the kidneys efficiently extract waste products, excess water, and electrolytes from the blood, maintaining overall fluid balance and body homeostasis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences essentially convey the same information, but with different structures. Let's analyze the two sentences to understand the similarities and subtle differences. Sentence 1: \\"Voters are already asking whether something is wrong with McCain.\\" This sentence is in the present continuous tense, indicating that the action (voters asking) is happening currently. It tells us that voters are in the process of asking if there is something wrong with McCain. The word \\"already\\" suggests that this is happening sooner than expected or previously anticipated. Sentence 2: \\"Is something wrong with McCain? Voters were asking.\\" The second sentence uses a different structure by first presenting the question (\\"Is something wrong with McCain?\\") and then describing who is asking it (\\"Voters were asking.\\"). This sentence is in the past continuous tense, indicating that the action of voters asking happened in the past but may still be ongoing. It provides a sense of duration to the situation. The use of \\"were\\" instead of \\"are\\" might seem to imply that the second sentence refers to a past event; however, it is well understood that past continuous tense can serve as a narrative technique to discuss events that may still be relevant or ongoing. The main difference between the two sentences is the tense and order in which the information is presented. Sentence 1 uses present continuous tense and presents the subject (voters) before the action (asking), whereas sentence 2 employs past continuous tense and first describes the action (the question) before identifying the subject (voters). Despite these differences in structure, both sentences express the point that voters are questioning if there is an issue with McCain. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence would also be considered true because the core information conveyed remains consistent between the two sentences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

John II, Count of Holland since 1299, also ruled over the County of Hainaut and the County of Zeeland, and was part of the House of Avesnes, the hereditary enemy of the Flemish House of Dampierre. Zealand had been contested between the Count of Flanders and the Count of Holland since the early 11th century and had become part of Holland by 1076. The Flemish invaded Hainaut in 1302 and conquered Lessines. Guy of Namur, son of the Count of Flanders, formed a fleet at Sluis and sailed on 23 April 1303 to claim Zeeland for the Flemish. After some initial successes, Guy was defeated on 10 and 11 August 1304 in the Battle of Zierikzee by a combined Franco-Hollandic fleet under Rainier Grimaldi, who had been sent by Philip IV of France to aid the Count of Holland. Guy of Namur was captured and Zeeland remained firmly in the hands of the Count of Holland. One week after this naval battle, on 18 August Philip IV himself fought the Flemish main army at the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle. This hard fought battle was inconclusive, but the death of William of Jülich and the serious material losses of the Flemish, made them sue for peace. After further minor battles, eventually the Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge was signed on 23 June 1305 which recognized Flemish independence, but at the cost of the cities of Lille, Douai and Orchies, which were transferred to France, and the paying of exorbitant fines to King Philip IV.

For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US.

What is the answer: In the Bible who was the husband of Bathsheba when she was first seen by David?","output":"In the Bible, Bathsheba's husband when she was first seen by David was Uriah the Hittite, who was an elite soldier in King David's army. The story of David, Bathsheba, and Uriah can be found in the Old Testament in the book of 2 Samuel, specifically chapters 11 and 12. The story goes as follows: One evening, while King David was walking on the roof of his palace, he saw a beautiful woman bathing. This woman was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite. David was captivated by her beauty and sent for her, ultimately committing adultery with her, which resulted in her becoming pregnant. Seeking to cover up his sin, David summoned Uriah back from the battlefront, hoping that he would sleep with his wife, and the child would be assumed to be his. However, Uriah, being a loyal soldier, refused to indulge in the pleasures of his home while his comrades were still fighting on the front lines. Uriah slept at the entrance of the palace, not going home to his wife. Seeing that his plan had failed, David devised another scheme. He ordered his commander Joab to place Uriah at the forefront of the fiercest battle, essentially ensuring his death. Following David's orders, Joab placed Uriah in a position where he was ultimately killed by the enemy forces. Upon receiving news of Uriah's death, David married Bathsheba, and she gave birth to their son. However, the Lord was displeased with David's actions, and he sent the prophet Nathan to confront him. Nathan presented a parable of a rich man who stole a poor man’s only lamb to serve to his guest, though he possessed many lambs himself. David recognized the sin in the story and condemned the rich man's actions, only for Nathan to reveal that the rich man represented David himself in his treatment of Uriah and Bathsheba. David immediately repented for his sins, and Nathan delivered God's judgment: the child born of their adultery would die, and David's household would experience turmoil. The judgment came to pass, with the death of their child and ongoing conflict within David's family. Although Uriah the Hittite was Bathsheba's husband when she was first seen by David, the story serves as a lesson about the consequences of sin and the importance of repentance and seeking God's forgiveness. Despite their initial sins, David and Bathsheba later had another son, Solomon, who became one of Israel's greatest kings, highlighting the aspect of forgiveness and redemption in their story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His mother, Donna Gay (nee Wauthier), was Canadian, and his father, Richard Glover, was American. His paternal grandfather was English and his maternal step-grandfather was voice-over announcer Wayne Howell. His family was based in Brazil for many years due to his father's presidency of the South American division of Pepsi-Cola. Context: On February 23, 2008 Steve-O joined the rest of the Jackass crew for the Jackass MTV 24 Hour Takeover, which promoted JackassWorld.com. He participated in several stunts, and even debuted his rap music video which was executive produced by recording artist D-Jukes, leading to Mike Judge bringing back the duo of Beavis and Butt-head for the first time in years to criticize it. Later, during the live broadcast Steve-O was kicked out of MTV studios on the request of executives for his behavior and intoxication.  On March 9, 2008, after receiving an e-mail from Steve-O that suggested his possible suicide, Steve-O's friends, including co-star Johnny Knoxville, became concerned he was a danger to himself and consulted with physician Dr. Drew Pinsky, who told them to get Steve-O to a hospital immediately. Steve-O was placed on a 72-hour psychiatric hold which was later lengthened to 14 days due to an alleged suicide attempt. In a mass e-mail addressed to his friends, Steve-O expressed that he previously had thought of his drug use and bipolarity as a \\"good thing\\", but that he now realizes that his drug use was apparently hurting those he loved most.  On June 4, 2008, Steve-O pleaded guilty to felony possession of cocaine. He avoided jail by the successful completion of his treatment program. In July, after 115 days of sobriety, Steve-O announced he was \\"back in the loony bin\\". He returned to the mental institution, he said, because \\"I've had horrible mood swings and severe depression. My brain is fucked up from using so much cocaine, ketamine, PCP, nitrous oxide, and all sorts of other drugs.\\" Question: did he try to commit suicide. Whats the answer?","output":"Steve-O, whose real name is Stephen Glover, did not explicitly attempt suicide; however, his behavior and a concerning email he sent to friends in March 2008 suggested that he could be a potential danger to himself. This email caused his friends, including Johnny Knoxville and Dr. Drew Pinsky, to worry about his well-being and the possibility of suicidal intentions. As a result, they decided to get Steve-O admitted to a hospital, where he was placed on a 72-hour psychiatric hold. This hold was later extended to 14 days due to concerns about an alleged suicide attempt. In an email addressed to his friends, Steve-O acknowledged that his drug use and bipolarity, which he had previously thought of as a \\"good thing,\\" were actually causing harm to the people he loved most. After he successfully completed a treatment program and pleaded guilty to felony possession of cocaine, Steve-O was dedicated to maintaining his sobriety. However, he later returned to a mental institution in July 2008, due to ongoing struggles with mood swings and severe depression. He attributed these challenges to the extensive use of various drugs, such as cocaine, ketamine, PCP, and nitrous oxide. To sum up, while there wasn't a clear-cut suicide attempt by Steve-O, his mental state and behaviors during that period raised significant concerns among his friends and led to his hospitalization and subsequent treatment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog. Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. What is most probably the case regarding why Trump did not make payment to the adult star directly? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. the payment was made without his knowledge  B. not enough information  C. he wanted this payment to remain private  D. his lawyer insisted on handling all transfers of funds on behalf of his clients","output":"C. he wanted this payment to remain private The reason behind choosing this option is that Trump reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the payment made to the adult film star. Trump's lawyers have mentioned that the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 paid to keep the adult film star quiet about an alleged tryst. Trump has denied the tryst but confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. This suggests that Trump intended to keep the payment private by having his lawyer handle the transaction rather than making a direct payment himself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who plan to retake the island? Movie title: The Rock Movie plot: On a rainy morning at Arlington National Cemetery, Brigadier General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) visits the grave of his wife, Barbara, who had recently passed away from an illness. He tells her that he misses her, but there is something he has to do now, and most of the world isn't going to like it. He hopes that wherever she is, she understands that he did what he had to do. After saying a final goodbye, he places his Medal of Honor on the headstone before he leaves.Later that night, Hummel leads a group of rogue Force Recon Marines on a raid of a Naval Weapons Depot. They seize a stockpile of rockets armed with weapons grade O-ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid, more commonly known as VX gas. They lose one of their men in the process, a horrific death caused by an accidental release of the chemical when one of the canisters was dropped and a sphere containing the deadly substance shatters.In an FBI lab in Washington DC, Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) is called in to inspect a package sent to Bosnian refugees. He and a trainee, Marv Isherwood (Todd Louiso), find a small doll inside that sprays them with sarin gas and contains a bomb made of C4 explosive that could destroy the lab and kill everyone in the building. As Stanley works frantically to disarm the bomb he turns down a hypodermic needle loaded with a dose of atropine. Stanley disarms the bomb successfully. At home that night, he relaxes until his girlfriend, Carla (Vanessa Marcil) arrives home. She tells him she's pregnant, and Stanley accepts her marriage proposal.Hummel is joined by other Marines who have served him over the course of his career; Major Tom Baxter (David Morse), who he served with in Vietnam, Captain Hendrix (John C. McGinley), who he served with in the Gulf, and Captains Frye (Gregory Sporleder) and Darrow (Tony Todd), who organized the raid on the weapons depot. They seize Alcatraz Island and take 81 tourists hostage, placing them in the prison cells, then threatening the FBI and Pentagon with launching the VX rockets against... A:","output":"The retake of Alcatraz Island in the film \\"The Rock\\" is planned by a group of highly trained individuals, specifically the FBI, Navy SEALS, and an unlikely pair of experts. The film's plot revolves around Brigadier General Francis Hummel (played by Ed Harris), who leads a team of rogue Force Recon Marines in an act of domestic terrorism. They take over Alcatraz Island, with Hummel's motivations mainly centering on his dissatisfaction with the U.S. government's failure to properly honor and provide for military personnel who were killed in classified missions. In response to the situation on Alcatraz Island, the FBI director (played by John Spencer) sends in a team of Navy SEALS in an effort to infiltrate the island and neutralize the threat posed by Hummel and his team. Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (played by Nicolas Cage), a chemical weapons specialist, is also sent along with the SEALS to assist in disarming the deadly VX gas rockets. Additionally, a former Alcatraz inmate, John Patrick Mason (played by Sean Connery), is recruited to the team due to his expertise in the island's layout, as he is the only prisoner known to have successfully escaped the famous penitentiary. The plan to retake the island is both a combination of force and wit, as the expertise of the Navy SEALS, Goodspeed's knowledge on chemical weapons, and Mason's familiarity with the prison all serve as essential components for a successful mission. The team must navigate the various traps and obstacles placed on the island by Hummel and his rogue Marines while simultaneously keeping the hostages' safety and wellbeing in mind. As the plot unfolds, tensions within Hummel's group arise, and their united front gradually crumbles. Goodspeed and Mason face numerous challenges in their efforts to defuse the rockets, rescue hostages, and prevent the catastrophe of widespread VX gas exposure to the population of San Francisco. The film culminates in a confrontation between the protagonists and Hummel's remaining loyal soldiers. In conclusion, the retake of Alcatraz Island in \\"The Rock\\" is planned and executed by the FBI, Navy SEALS, Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (a chemical weapons expert), and John Patrick Mason (a former Alcatraz inmate). The team works together with a common goal of saving the hostages, disarming the deadly VX gas rockets, and reclaiming Alcatraz Island from Hummel's rogue Marines. The film offers a thrilling and dramatic narrative that highlights the importance of teamwork, expertise, and determination in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gregory James \\"Greg\\" LeMond (born June 26, 1961) is an American former professional road racing cyclist who won the Road Race World Championship twice (1983 and 1989) and the Tour de France three times (1986, 1989 and 1990). He is also an entrepreneur and anti-doping advocate. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, near Reno. He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations. In 1990, LeMond founded LeMond Bicycles to develop machines for himself that would also be marketed and sold to the public. The following year, searching for an equipment edge for Team Z at the 1991 Tour de France, LeMond concluded an exclusive licensing agreement between his company and Carbonframes, Inc., to access the latter's advanced composites technology. While LeMond briefly led the 1991 Tour overall, riding his Carbonframes-produced \\"Greg LeMond\\" bicycle, the company eventually faltered, something LeMond blamed on \\"under-capitalization\\" and poor management by his father. Carbonframes and LeMond Cycles \\"parted amiably two years later.\\" In 1995, with his company allegedly nearly bankrupt, LeMond reached a licensing-agreement with Trek Bicycle Corporation, according to which the Wisconsin-based company would manufacture and distribute bicycles designed with LeMond that would be sold under the \\"LeMond Bicycles\\" brand. LeMond would later claim that going into business with Trek \\"destroyed\\" his relationship with his father. The lucrative partnership, which generated revenue for Trek in excess of 100,000,000 USD, would be renewed several times over the course of 13 years, but it ultimately ended in acrimony after LeMond's relationship with Trek deteriorated over his staunch anti-doping advocacy.  The two parties first found themselves at odds in July 2001, after LeMond expressed public concern over the relationship between Italian doping doctor Michele Ferrari and Trek's star athlete, Lance Armstrong. \\"When I heard he was working with Michele Ferrari, I was devastated,\\" LeMond was quoted as saying of Armstrong. \\"If Lance is clean, it is the greatest comeback in the history of sports. If he isn't, it would be the greatest fraud.\\"  Trek's president John Burke pressured LeMond to apologize, claiming, \\"Greg's public comments hurt the LeMond brand and the Trek brand.\\" Burke allegedly justified his demand for an apology by advising that, \\"As a contractual partner, he [LeMond] could criticize doping only generally - not point his finger at specific athletes, particularly one that happens to be the company's main cash cow.\\"  In April 2008, Trek announced that it was dropping LeMond Bicycles from its product line and would sue to sever the licensing agreement. It quickly emerged that in March 2008, LeMond had filed a complaint against Trek for breach of contract, claiming that they had not made a \\"best efforts\\" attempt to sell his bicycles, as well as describing attempts to 'silence' him about doping, including incidents in 2001 and 2004. His complaint included statistics detailing slow sales in some markets, including the fact that between September 2001 and June 2007, Trek only sold 10,393 worth of LeMond bikes in France, a country in which LeMond was both famous and popular.  As promised, Trek counter-sued and stopped producing bicycles under the LeMond brand. After nearly two years of litigation, in February 2010, LeMond reached an out-of-court settlement with Trek in their breach-of-contract dispute, the terms of which were confidential. The settlement permitted the case to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning, \\"neither side can produce the same claims against one another in a future lawsuit.\\" And although settlement terms were not disclosed, LeMond reportedly obtained full control over the LeMond Bicycles name, while Trek made a donation of 200,000 USD to the charity 1in6, of which LeMond was a founding member of the board of directors. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Was LeMond Cycles a success?","output":"LeMond Cycles was not a complete success.

Translate to Romanian","output":"Reglementarea mișcării acestor produse alimentare între țările europene va implica o combinație de reguli și reglementări, acorduri comerciale, controale și mecanisme de monitorizare. Un astfel de cadru complex are ca scop promovarea unui comerț sigur, eficient și durabil între țările europene. Trebuie să se ițe cont de mai mulți factori, inclusiv de calitatea alimentelor, siguranța alimentară, taxele vamale și standardele de mediu. 1. Regulile și reglementările la nivel național și regional: În primul rând, țările europene au propriile lor legi și reglementări în ceea ce privește producția și distribuția produselor alimentare. Producătorii și distribuitorii de produse alimentare trebuie să respecte aceste reglementări locale atunci când transportă alimente între țări. Acest lucru poate implica verificări ale calității și standardelor de igienă, precum și teste pentru prezența contaminanților și reziduuri de pesticide. 2. Piața internă a Uniunii Europene: Pentru statele membre ale Uniunii Europene, mișcarea produselor alimentare între țări este facilitată de piața internă a UE, care vizează facilitarea comerțului în cadrul blocului comercial. Piața internă promovează armonizarea legislației alimentare și eliminarea barierelor comerciale, precum taxele vamale și restricțiile cantitative. Statele membre trebuie să se conformeze standardelor comune ale UE în ceea ce privește calitatea și siguranța alimentară, etichetarea produselor și protecția mediului înconjurător. 3. Acordurile comerciale: În afara pieței interne, comerțul cu produse alimentare între țările europene poate fi reglementat prin acorduri comerciale bilaterale sau multilaterale, care stabilesc condițiile și regulile de acces la piață, taxele vamale și alte cerințe specifice. Acest tip de acorduri ajută la promovarea comerțului între țările europene și la facilitarea accesului la marile piețe regionale. 4. Controale și mecanisme de monitorizare: Pentru a asigura respectarea regulilor și reglementărilor și pentru a proteja siguranța consumatorilor, țările europene au instituit diverse controale și mecanisme de monitorizare. Acestea pot include: - Controalele la frontieră: Aceste controale sunt efectuate la punctele de intrare în țară pentru a verifica dacă produsele alimentare îndeplinesc standardele de calitate și siguranță, precum și pentru a asigura respectarea reglementărilor vamale și fiscale. De exemplu, produsele alimentare care intră în UE sunt supuse controlului și verificării din partea autorităților vamale și de siguranță a alimentelor.     - Sistemul rapid de alertă pentru produse alimentare și furaje (RASFF): Acest sistem facilitează schimbul de informații între autoritățile de siguranță a alimentelor din statele membre ale UE, atunci când se identifică un risc pentru sănătatea publică legat de un produs alimentar sau furaj. Acesta permite țărilor să ia măsuri rapide și coordonate pentru a proteja sănătatea consumatorilor și a preveni răspândirea contaminanților sau a bolilor.     - Auditurile și inspecțiile: Acestea sunt efectuate pentru a verifica conformitatea producătorilor de alimente și a distribuitorilor cu regulile și reglementările aferente, precum și pentru a evalua eficacitatea sistemelor de control al siguranței alimentelor la nivel național și regional. Prin urmare, reglementarea mișcării produselor alimentare între țările europene implică o abordare integrată și adaptabilă care combină diferite instrumente și mecanisme pentru a garanta un comerț sigur și durabil și pentru a proteja sănătatea consumatorilor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Joseph had many more pet bunny rabbits than Kyle because","output":"Joseph had a deep-seated love for animals, particularly bunny rabbits. This had grown from his early years, when he was first introduced to these delightful creatures by his grandmother during his visits to her countryside home. Joseph's connection with rabbits was not merely for their fluffiness or charming dispositions but went deeper, primarily towards their unique personalities and behaviors that he found fascinating and heartwarming. In contrast, Kyle was less of an animal enthusiast and more of a practical character. He kept a few rabbits, largely due to societal pressure and as a means to teach his children about responsibility. His involvement with them was not as immersive, nor as romantic, as Joseph's. Kyle's rabbits were well-taken care of, but the quantity and variety were much less than that of Joseph's. The reason was simple - Kyle saw these pets more as a duty or obligation rather than companions to cherish. Joseph’s affinity for rabbits manifested itself in several ways that led to his larger collection. Initially, Joseph began by adopting rabbits from local shelters, rescuing them from poor living conditions. He devoted a significant portion of his backyard to create a bunny haven, a space designed specifically to suit their needs. Thanks to his meticulous research, the space was safe and comfortably equipped with necessary amenities such as a variety of foods rabbits eat, several mini hutches for shelter and resting, and open areas for them to play and exercise. With time, Joseph's involvement in the local rabbit communities escalated. He began attending rabbit shows, participating in online groups, and fostering close friendships with fellow rabbit enthusiasts who shared his passion. It was not long before Joseph became a well-known figure to local breeders and sometimes was given the privilege to adopt special breeds. Joseph’s dedication extended beyond simply housing the rabbits. He invested time in studying rabbit care, even undertaking a basic veterinary course to understand their health better. He prepared their meals with a precision that represented his understanding of their dietary needs, ensuring each meal was a healthy blend of hay, fruits, vegetables, and rabbit pellets.  Joseph also took the time to interact with each rabbit individually to keep them mentally stimulated. His rabbits were given names that represented their unique personalities, and he spent countless hours observing them interact, memorizing their individual behaviors, traits, preferences, and even their dislikes. They were not merely pets to him; they were his little companions, each with a unique personality and a special place in his heart. To sum up, Joseph had many more bunny rabbits than Kyle because his love extended beyond just owning pets. His respect, dedication, and understanding of these animals were profound, evident from his commitment to their care and well being. From rescue missions to providing a safe haven, engaging with rabbit communities to adopting special breeds, Joseph's actions were fuelled by his deep love for bunnies. Unlike Kyle, for whom rabbits were more of a responsibility, Joseph saw them as a meaningful part of his life, each rabbit adding a new dimension to his vernacular of joy and companionship. Their numbers kept on adding, not because he wanted to boast of more, but because his heart had made space for yet another fluffy friend."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Seven Years%27 War The Seven Years' War was fought between 1755 and 1764, the main conflict occurring in the seven-year period from 1756 to 1763. It involved every great power of the time except the Ottoman Empire, and affected Europe, the Americas, West Africa, India, and the Philippines. Considered a prelude to the two world wars and the greatest European war since the Thirty Years War of the 17th century, it once again split Europe into two coalitions, led by Great Britain on one side and France on the other. For the first time, aiming to curtail Britain and Prussia's ever-growing might, France formed a grand coalition of its own, which ended with failure as Britain rose as the world's predominant power, altering the European balance of power.

Question: Rommel is a mechanic and what kind of racer? Movie title: Sidehackers Movie plot: The film centers on Rommel, a mechanic and sidehack-style racer, who turns down the offer of J.C., a hot-tempered entertainer, to join his act after J.C. witnesses a sidehack race for the first time. During this time, J.C.'s abused girlfriend, Paisley, falls for Rommel and attempts to seduce him. He rejects her advances and sends her away crying. Later, when J.C. and his crew return to their hotel, they find Paisley drunk and her clothes tattered, claiming that Rommel raped her. Angered, J.C. and his gang beat Rommel unconscious and kill his fiancee, Rita. Rommel then spends the rest of the movie plotting his revenge against J.C., who goes into hiding from the police. The film's end is nihilistic in nature. After both Rommel and J.C.'s men have killed each other (while two of Rommel's men escaped on a sidehack bike), the two men brawl. When Rommel manages to gain the upper hand, he elects to walk away when the police are about to arrive, but J.C. picks up a gun and shoots Rommel from behind. The last images of the film are a flashback of Rommel and his fiancee rolling about in a grassy field, superimposed over a shot of Rommel's dead body.

Mr Hu said that the flight had not been timed to coincide with Mr Gates' visit, the US defence secretary said. The US is currently the only nation with a fully operational stealth plane. But both Russia and China are known to be working on prototypes of stealth fighters, which are invisible to radar. Mr Gates' three-day visit to Beijing comes amid US concern over the speed at which China's military is modernising and upgrading its technology. \\"I asked President Hu about it directly, and he said that the test had absolutely nothing to do with my visit and had been a pre-planned test. And that's where we left it,\\" Mr Gates was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. By Shirong ChenBBC China Editor Before the official confirmation from the president, pictures reportedly taken by fighter jet spotters had appeared on all major Chinese web portals, including the state-run Xinhua news agency. There is also a video clip showing the stealth fighter taxi-ing, taking off and landing, accompanied by a trainer jet, with fans chatting and shouting \\"magnificent\\". The spotters have been camped out near the fighter jet design institute in Chengdu, in south-west China. They have dubbed the prototype \\"Black Ribbon\\", meaning black 4th generation fighter. They also say that Xi Jinping, China's Vice-President and Vice-Chairman of the Military Commission, visited the airfield on Saturday, presumably to witness a test flight that was aborted due to bad weather. Leaked images of what was said to be China's J-20 fighter first appeared earlier this month during taxi tests at the Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute. On Tuesday, the plane took off and flew for about 15 minutes, according to eyewitness accounts published on unofficial Chinese web portals. A video clip of the flight was also posted on the web. China says it expects the stealth plane to be operational some time between 2017 and 2019. But earlier this month the Pentagon played down concerns over the fighter. \\"Developing a stealth capability with a prototype and then integrating that into a combat environment is going to take some time,\\" said US director of naval intelligence Vice Admiral David Dorsett. China's official military budget quadrupled between 1999 and 2009 as the country's economy grew. In 2010 it stood at 78bn (Â£50bn). But the US has by far the largest defence budget in the world at just over 700bn.

Eventually the police were lucky      Japanese police have captured a fugitive who had eluded authorities for weeks in a bizarre drama that gripped the country.      Tatsuma Hirao, 27, had made a run for it from an open prison in the town of Imabari.      Police deployed more than 6,000 officers on the small island of Mukaishima, using everything from dogs to helicopters and drones.      He was caught at a train station in Hiroshima, about 70km (40 miles) away.      Hirao was not considered a dangerous criminal.      Serving five and a half years for theft, he was being held at a facility where inmates are free to walk about without walls or fences.      The system did not work in the case of Hirao. The first clues following his getaway were on Mukaishima.      On the face of it, the 22 sq km (8.5 sq mile) island of 22,000 people should not have been an easy place to hide.      Image copyright Kyodo News Image caption Police officers search properties on Mukaishima      Yet despite using helicopters, sniffer dogs and drones, Hirao kept eluding his pursuers.      All the police found were small clues: fingerprints, items like socks or mobile phones thought to have been stolen by the fugitive or even just rubbish from the food he ate.      When he stole a car, he left a note assuring the owner that \\"I'm borrowing your car but I'll never damage it\\".      The story created a nationwide media frenzy about how one person could outsmart police week after week.      The country's justice minister had to apologise publicly for failing to find the fugitive.      You might also be interested in:      One reason for the failure might have been that Mukaishima has around 1,000 unoccupied holiday homes scattered around the hilly, forested landscape.

(AFP)      A thief who fled an open jail in Japan sparking a high-profile manhunt involving some 15,000 officers was taken into custody on Monday, police said, more than three weeks after his escape.Tatsuma Hirao, 27, a \\"model\\" inmate who was serving time for multiple thefts, was arrested on a street near Hiroshima railway station in western Japan, a local police spokesman told AFP.He was captured some 70 kilometres (40 miles) west of Mukaishima island, where police had deployed helicopters, drones, police dogs and infrared detectors to find him.Hundreds of officers a day were sent to the island for the manhunt with the total number reportedly reaching around 15,000 since early April, local media said.Hirao told investigators that he escaped from the island by swimming across the sea, according to public broadcaster NHK.Television footage showed Hirao, who was unshaven and wearing a black shirt, taken by several police officers to a police vehicle.The case has made headline news in Japan with TV channels picking over the manhunt in minute detail.Hirao gave guards the slip on April 8, vanishing from the facility, an \\"open institution\\" where inmates can walk around freely.Police detected the fugitive's fingerprints and several thefts have been reported since his escape.The stolen items include socks, a mobile phone, a wallet, a pair of sandals and a car key, whose owner found a polite note -- apparently from the fugitive -- saying: \\"I'm borrowing your car but I'll never damage it.\\"Justice Minister Yoko Kawakami made a rare apology for the difficulties in recapturing the criminal.\\"I deeply apologise to local residents and many people for troubling and worrying them for such a long time,\\" Kawakami said in a statement, adding that her ministry will take preventive measures.A total of 20 inmates have escaped since the prison opened in 1961.Japan enjoys one of the lowest crime rates in the developed world but has a relatively high reoffending rate. ||||| TOKYO (AP) — A convicted thief was recaptured Monday three weeks after a rare escape from a Japanese prison and an island manhunt he may have eluded by swimming.      Tatsuma Hirao escaped from a low-security prison in Ehime prefecture on April 8 during a work assignment while serving a 5 ½ year sentence for theft. The escape caused anxiety in the region and attracted national attention.      After escaping, he allegedly drove a stolen car along a highway connecting several islands.      Police believe he arrived on the island of Mukaishima, where more than 1,000 police searched for him daily. They said his fingerprints were detected at the scenes of several reported thefts of clothes and food after the jailbreak.      Hirao, 27, was arrested Monday after being spotted walking on a street in Hiroshima after an internet cafe reportedly notified police that a man resembling him visited. In a video of the arrest broadcast on TV Asahi, a man identified as Hirao tried to climb over a concrete wall to escape, but was pulled down, thrown to the ground and seized by several policemen.      The island has abundant places to hide. It has about 1,000 houses made vacant by an aging and shrinking population and is also only 200 meters (yards) from the Hiroshima coast.      Media reports say Hirao told police that he swam from Mukaishima to a city in Hiroshima prefecture to escape the manhunt, then took a train west to Hiroshima city. Hirao said he hid in vacant houses while on the island, but became tired of evading police, public broadcaster NHK reported.      Hirao was arrested in 2013 for a series of robberies in southern Japan.      Japan has a relatively low crime rate, and prison escapes are rare.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \\"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence. He withdrew from the agreement, which Ricordi then assigned to the composer Alberto Franchetti.  Illica wrote a libretto for Franchetti, who was never at ease with the assignment. When Puccini once again became interested in Tosca, Ricordi was able to get Franchetti to surrender the rights so he could recommission Puccini.  One story relates that Ricordi convinced Franchetti that the work was too violent to be successfully staged. A Franchetti family tradition holds that Franchetti gave the work back as a grand...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person whose third Benhardt play was La Tosca?

Although the reviewer begins the text with a moderately positive tone, recounting a promising first visit with an appreciation for the quality of the fettuccine, the narrative progressively transitions into a fairly strong negative sentiment.  At the beginning of the review, the sentiment is mixed due to the perceived discrepancy between the main dish and its sides; the reviewer seems somewhat confused about the unusual combination of having potato-based sides (french fries or mashed potatoes) with pasta like fettuccine. As such, skepticism appears right from the beginning, casting a certain level of criticism toward the restaurant's culinary appropriateness. In the middle of the review, there's a marked negative shift. The sentiment turns quite negative when the reviewer discusses the second visit. The use of the interjection \\"Yikes\\" underlines a strong disapproval of the apparently diminished food quality. The once-praised fettuccine is now deemed \\"bland,\\" implying disappointment and failed expectations after the initial positive experience. The insignificance of the chef factor (by revealing that it was the same chef) seems to boost the reviewer's confusion and dissatisfaction. Finally, the review concludes with an unequivocally negative sentiment. The husband's dish, a spaghetti, is harshly criticized as being \\"so salty he could not finish it.\\" This remark underscores a severe lapse in the restaurant's food quality management, enhancing the overall negative sentiment in the review. Also, the reviewer's definite decision not to return to the restaurant and the feeling of wasting money show a profound discontentment. They are distressed by the restaurant's perceived inability to maintain consistency and quality, thereby firmly anchoring the overall negative sentiment of the review.  Indeed, the sentiment is not only negative toward the food quality but also the restaurant's management, as the reviewer indicates their disappointment in the establishment's seeming unawareness or inability to correct their inconsistent performance. This review, thus, potentially warns prospective diners about these qualities or lack thereof."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Begin by researching the most recent data and statistics on infant mortality rates around the world. Reliable sources for this information include the World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Check for any available data and reports on their websites. 2. Compare the data collected from the sources to identify countries or regions with the highest infant mortality rates. Look for trends, patterns, and any factors contributing to these high rates. This might include socio-economic factors, healthcare access and quality, or cultural practices. 3. Once the countries with the highest infant mortality rates are identified, find any additional information that may provide context or reasons for these high rates. This could include reports on healthcare systems, government efforts to combat infant mortality, or public health initiatives. 4. With the information gathered, form a conclusion on where the highest infant mortality rates are found. In recent years, countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have consistently had the highest rates. 5. Provide the answer, including the countries or regions identified, along with a brief explanation of the possible reasons for these high infant mortality rates.

The film is based on actual events, beginning in August 1941.  Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Jews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettoes are the Belarusian Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron. Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Jewish camp in exchange for supplies.

Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency).

In Week 2, he threw for 186 yards and two touchdowns beating the Miami Dolphins, ranking him seventh in passing yards and tied for second with six touchdown passes. Romo added 329 passing yards and two touchdown passes in the Cowboys' Week 3 34-10 win over the Chicago Bears. The following week, he passed for 339 yards and three touchdowns in a 35-7 win over the St. Louis Rams. He also ran for an additional touchdown. This brought his season totals to 1199 passing yards with 11 passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns.  In Week 5, on Monday Night Football against the Buffalo Bills, Romo threw five interceptions (four in the first half, two of which were returned for touchdowns) and lost a fumble. He became the second person in the history of Monday Night Football to throw five interceptions in a winning effort. The first person was his quarterbacks coach Wade Wilson. Nonetheless, he threw for 4,211 yards (third in the NFL) and 36 touchdown passes during the regular season (second only to Tom Brady). His 97.4 passer rating was good enough for fifth in the NFL behind Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, David Garrard, and Peyton Manning.  On October 29, Romo reached an agreement to a six-year, 67.5 million contract extension with the Cowboys.  On November 29 against the Green Bay Packers, in a game between 10-1 teams, Romo threw four touchdown passes (bringing his season total to 33), breaking Danny White's (29) record from 1983. On December 22 against the Carolina Panthers, Romo became the first Cowboys' quarterback to pass for more than 4,000 yards in a season. Finally on December 30 against the Washington Redskins, Romo broke the Cowboys' season completions record with his 335th completion, a short pass to tight end Jason Witten. The Cowboys finished the season with a 13-3 record.  In the Cowboys' January 13, 2008, divisional playoff game against the New York Giants, Romo was unable to lead his team to a come-from-behind victory. On fourth down with less than half a minute and no timeouts left, Romo threw the ball into the end zone, but it was intercepted by Giants cornerback R. W. McQuarters, ensuring that the Cowboys were eliminated from the playoffs with a 21-17 loss to the eventual Super Bowl XLII champions. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they won with Green Bay Packers in November 29?","output":"Yes, they did win! The passage says, \\"On November 29 against the Green Bay Packers, in a game between 10-1 teams, Romo threw four touchdown passes\\". This tells us that Romo helped his team win the game by throwing four times the ball to his teammates who scored points or \\"touchdowns.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A toddler has a rare condition that makes his skin so dry he can't blink. Daniel Maples, who is 18 months-old, was born with lamellar ichthyosis - which affects just one in 600,000 people - and causes the skin to become thickened and cracked. The top layer of his skin sheds six times faster than normal - leaving a thick, scale-like build-up of skin underneath. Daniel Maples, 18 months old, has a rare, genetic condition which causes his skin to thicken and crack. The top layer of Daniel's skin sheds six times faster than normal - leaving a thick, scale-like build-up. His parents Steve Maples, 29 and Emma Holby, 23, have to smother him in medical jelly like Vaseline every four hours to stop his delicate skin from cracking. Mr Maples, a recruiter from Maldon, Essex, said: ‘The skin is thick and it peels off and it takes about two months to completely come off. ‘Over time he now has to be creamed every four to six hours each day and every three hours throughout the night. ‘It’s a very high maintenance condition and he also requires two or three showers a day as well as eye drops because he doesn’t blink. ‘He’s been in and out of hospital with skin infections because of the condition. ‘It will continue throughout his life and there’s no cure for it. When he is older he’ll have to do it all himself.’ Daniel's parents have to apply cream to his skin every four hours during the day and every three hours throughout the night. He is pictured with his mother, Emma Holby. There is no cure for Daniel's condition so as he gets older he will have to learn to manage it himself. He is pictured with his father, Steve Maples. He added: ‘Emma and I were just unlucky that we both had the gene. There is a one in four chance any children we have will get it. ‘As long as he’s been brought up right and it’s not an issue he will be alright. ‘It’s one of those things, he’s just a bit different. He’s a very happy child and as long as we teach him to be confident about himself I don’t see why he can’t lead a normal life.’ Lamellar ichthyosis, which develops when a child inherits an abnormal gene from both parents, speeds up the skin cell turnover. The word ichthyosis comes from the ancient Greek word for fish - because the cracked skin is said to resemble the scales on a fish. Daniel does not blink so he has to be given eye drops regularly so his eyes don't dry out. Throughout his life, Daniel has been in and out of hospital with skin infections. Image (right) shows him in hospital being treated with a Vaseline-like jelly. Problems associated with the condition include overheating, where a person’s thick skin prevents them from sweating, and eye problems caused by the tightness of the skin. Some children get ‘constriction bands’ which mean they have tight bands of skin around their fingers or toes which can prevent proper blood circulation. Severe scaling of the skin on the scalp can also lead to patchy loss of hair. Daniel’s parents are hoping to raise money for The Ichthyosis Support Group, and have so far raised £2,900 towards the fight for a cure. Anyone wishing to donate can do so by clicking here. Lamellar ichthyosis is a very rare skin condition characterised by abnormal scaling and shedding of the skin. It is believed to occur in one in every 600,000 people and symptoms usually appear within the first few days of life. Sufferers tend to have plate-like scales of skin which often appear brownish in colour. The condition is caused by genetic abnormalities that affect the shedding of skin. It occurs when both of a person's parents carry the abnormal gene - in this situation, there is a one in four chance of the person developing the condition. Lamellar ichthyosis can also cause overheating as it prevents sweating, and can constrict the blood flow to the fingers and toes as it causes the skin tighten. It can also cause eye problems, hair loss, and difficulty bending the hand joints. There is currently no cure and the key treatment is regularly applying moisturiser.

Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, (; 18 May 1872 – 2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, political activist and Nobel laureate. At various points in his life he considered himself a liberal, a socialist, and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had \\"never been any of these things, in any profound sense\\". He was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom.  In the early 20th century, Russell led the British \\"revolt against idealism\\". He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, colleague G. E. Moore, and protégé Ludwig Wittgenstein. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians. With A. N. Whitehead he wrote \\"Principia Mathematica\\", an attempt to create a logical basis for mathematics. His philosophical essay \\"On Denoting\\" has been considered a \\"paradigm of philosophy\\". His work has had a considerable influence on mathematics, logic, set theory, linguistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computer science (see type theory and type system), and philosophy, especially the philosophy of language, epistemology, and metaphysics.  Russell was a prominent anti-war activist; he championed anti-imperialism. Occasionally, he advocated preventive nuclear war, before the opportunity provided by the atomic monopoly had passed, and \\"welcomed with enthusiasm\\" world government. He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I. Later, he concluded war against Adolf Hitler was a necessary \\"lesser of two evils\\". He criticized Stalinist totalitarianism, attacked the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War, and was an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus? ?  The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly...

This Act may be cited as the \`\`Defending Against Imitations and  Replacements of Yogurt, Milk, and Cheese To Promote Regular Intake of  Dairy Everyday Act'' or the \`\`DAIRY PRIDE Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress finds as follows:             (1) Dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet          for both children and adults, according to the 2015-2020          Dietary Guidelines for Americans (referred to in this section          as the \`\`Dietary Guidelines'') published by the Department of          Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture.          The Dietary Guidelines state that most Americans are not          meeting recommended intake for the dairy food group.          Consumption of dairy foods provides numerous health benefits,          including lowering the risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome,          cardiovascular disease, and obesity.             (2) The Dietary Guidelines state that dairy foods are          excellent sources of critical nutrients for human health,          including vitamin D, calcium, and potassium, all of which are          under consumed by people of the United States. When consumed in          the amounts recommended by the Food Patterns of the Department          of Agriculture, on average across the calorie levels, dairy          foods contribute about 67 percent of calcium, 64 percent of          vitamin D, and 17 percent of magnesium.             (3) About 30 percent of adolescent boys meet or exceed the          recommended 3-cup equivalents per day, but less than 10 percent          of adolescent females meet or exceed this recommendation. An          age-related decline in dairy intake appears to begin in          adolescence and intakes persist at very low levels among adult          females across the age distribution. Less than 5 percent of          adult females consume the recommended 3-cup equivalents per          day. Overall, more than 80 percent of the entire population of          the United States does not meet the daily dairy intake          recommendation.             (4) The Dietary Guidelines state that vitamin D and          potassium amounts vary across plant-based milk alternatives.          The amount of calcium per calorie is lower for most plant-based          alternative milk products. To obtain the amount of calcium          contained in one cup of non-fat fluid milk from a plant-based          milk alternative, the portion size and calorie intake must be          greater.             (5) Imitation dairy products, such as plant-based products          derived from rice, nuts, soybeans, hemp, coconut, algae, and          other foods that imitate milk, yogurt, and cheese, often do not          provide the same nutrition content as real milk, cheese, and          yogurt derived from dairy cows.             (6) Plant-based products labeled as milk are misleading to          consumers.             (7) The Food and Drug Administration has regulations that          define milk and cream as the \`\`lacteal secretion, practically          free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or          more healthy cows'' (section 131.110 of title 21, Code of          Federal Regulations). This definition further applies to milk          used to create other dairy products, including yogurt and          cheese, as specified in sections 131 and 133 of title 21, Code          of Federal Regulations.             (8) Given the proliferation of plant-based products in the          marketplace that are mislabeled as milk despite the standard of          identity defined for this substance, enforcement by the Food          and Drug Administration against these practices should be          improved to avoid misleading consumers. SEC. 3. PURPOSE.     No food may be introduced or delivered for introduction into  interstate commerce using a market name for a dairy product if the food  does not meet the criterion set forth for dairy products under  paragraph (z)(2) of section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act (21 U.S.C. 343) (as added by section 4(a)). SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT OF DEFINITION.     (a) In General.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end the  following:     \`\`(z)(1) If it uses a market name for a dairy product described in  subparagraph (3) and the food does not meet the criterion for being a  dairy product, as described in subparagraph (2).     \`\`(2) For purposes of this paragraph, a food is a dairy product  only if the food is, contains as a primary ingredient, or is derived  from, the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained  by the complete milking of one or more hooved mammals.     \`\`(3) A market name for a dairy product described in this  subparagraph means the dairy product terms described in parts 131 and  133 of subchapter B of chapter I of title 21, Code of Federal  Regulations, and sections 135.110, 135.115, and 135.140 of title 21,  Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations), or any  other term for which the Secretary has promulgated a standard of  identity with respect to a food that is formulated with a dairy product  (as described in subparagraph (2)) as the primary ingredient.''.     (b) Guidance.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting  through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall--             (1) not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of          this Act, issue draft guidance on how enforcement of the          amendment made by subsection (a) will be carried out; and             (2) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of          this Act, issue final guidance on such enforcement.     (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 2 years after the date of  enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services,  acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall report to  Congress on enforcement actions taken under paragraph (z) of section  403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343), as  amended by this Act, including warnings issued pursuant to such  paragraph and penalties assessed under section 303 of such Act (21  U.S.C. 333) with respect to such paragraph. If food that is misbranded  under section 403(z) is offered for sale in interstate commerce at the  time of such report, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall include  in such report an updated plan for enforcement with respect to such  food. A:","output":"The \\"Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, Milk, and Cheese To Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act\\" or the \\"DAIRY PRIDE Act\\" seeks to regulate the labeling and marketing of dairy products by ensuring that products labeled as milk, yogurt, and cheese are derived from actual dairy sources. This act highlights the nutritional differences between dairy products and plant-based alternatives and aims to reduce consumer confusion. It pushes for enforcement by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to comply with existing regulations about the definition of milk and other dairy products. Additionally, the act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue guidance on enforcement and report to Congress on enforcement actions taken under the amended section."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The Palestinian Authority's Al-Hayat-al-Jadida also denied that the drawing - of a robed figure standing over the Earth - represented the Prophet. Most Muslims view any depictions of the Prophet as forbidden - and offensive. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has ordered an inquiry into the publication of the cartoon. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, said Mr Abbas had called for \\"deterrent action against those responsible for this terrible mistake\\". Mr Abbas was among the world leaders who attended a rally in Paris last month to condemn a deadly gun attack on the offices of a satirical magazine that had caricatured Muhammad. The gunmen - both of whom had links to jihadist militants - killed prominent journalists at the Charlie Hebdo magazine, in apparent retaliation for the caricatures. The attack sparked a global debate over freedom of expression and its limits. Al-Hayat-al-Jadida published a drawing in its 1 February edition that featured a robed figure standing over the Earth, scattering seeds from a heart-shaped bag. The caption to the drawing said, \\"Our Prophet Muhammad\\". The cartoonist, Mohammed Sabanneh, later wrote on his Facebook page that he had not meant any harm by the drawing, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Sabanneh said the robed figure did not represent the Prophet but was \\"a symbol of humanity enlightened by what the Prophet Muhammad brought\\". Along with its apology, the West Bank-based newspaper announced that it had launched an inquiry into \\"the published drawing that led to the misunderstanding\\". The paper emphasised that the \\"the intention behind the publication of the image was to defend religions and to spread love and peace\\". A summary of the above article is?","output":"There was a drawing in a newspaper that made some people upset because they thought it showed the Prophet Muhammad. People who follow the religion of Islam believe it is not allowed to make pictures of the Prophet, so they found this drawing offensive. The person who made the drawing said he didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings and the newspaper said sorry. They will look into why this happened and try to make sure it doesn't happen again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer based on context: After their win over the Jets, the Ravens stayed at home for a Week 3 interconference fight with the Arizona Cardinals.  In the first quarter, Baltimore took flight first with kicker Matt Stover getting a 21-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Ravens increased its lead with Stover getting a 28-yard field goal.  The Cardinals would respond with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 48-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Baltimore began to unload with QB Steve McNair completing a 13-yard TD pass to WR Derrick Mason, while rookie WR Yamon Figurs returned a punt 75 yards for a touchdown. In the third quarter, Arizona managed to get a 40-yard field goal from Rackers, while the Ravens had Stover kick a 43-yard field goal.  However, in the fourth quarter, the Cardinals started to work their way back into the game with QB Kurt Warner completing a 5-yard and a 32-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin, along with Rackers getting a 41-yard field goal to tie the game.  Stover helped Baltimore close out the game with a win as he nailed the game-winning 46-yard field goal as time expired.

Here are possible answers to this question: - compliments - understand themselves - life partner - second chances - larger house  I believe the correct choice is \\"larger house\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"A person needs to get a larger house when they have more kids, and here's why: 1. Space: With more kids, the need for space increases. Children need rooms for sleeping, playing, and studying. A larger house provides the required space for various activities, promoting a healthy living environment. 2. Privacy: As children grow older, they require personal space and privacy. A larger house will provide separate rooms and areas for kids to have their privacy, contributing positively to their development. 3. Storage: More kids mean more clothes, toys, books, and other belongings. A larger house will offer more storage options, helping to keep everything organized and avoid clutter. 4. Family time and entertainment: A larger house typically has more communal areas, like a bigger living room or family room. This allows the family to spend quality time together while still having enough space for different activities and interests. 5. Accommodating guests: A larger house provides additional space for hosting guests, allowing friends and extended family members to visit comfortably. This can be particularly important if you have a large family or frequently invite friends over. 6. Potential for growth: As the family continues to grow, there may be additional life changes that require more space, such as elderly family members moving in, or housing a home office or business. Having a larger house provides the flexibility needed to adapt to these changes. In conclusion, a larger house is the most fitting choice to accommodate the various necessities that arise from having more kids. A home that meets the space, privacy, storage, and entertainment needs of an expanding family will significantly contribute to a fulfilling and harmonious living environment."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling.

Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side.

Fun Lovin' Criminals are a band from New York City. Their musical style is eclectic, covering styles such as hip hop, rock, blues, jazz, R&B, punk, and funk. They are best known for their hit \\"Scooby Snacks\\", which features samples from films by Quentin Tarantino, and the song \\"Love Unlimited\\", which recalls Barry White's backing vocal group. Their songs often focus on life in New York City, as well as urban life in general. The band was formed in 1993 by Huey Morgan, Brian \\"Fast\\" Leiser and Steve Borgovini after Leiser, who was already friends with Borgovini, met Morgan at the club where they both worked. They started playing together and would provide the entertainment for the club when a booked act failed to show up. It was during one of these stand-in gigs that they came to the attention of EMI and they were offered a record deal.  Come Find Yourself, the band's first album, was released in the summer of 1996 by Chrysalis Records and followed their single \\"The Grave And The Constant\\" (UK No. 72), which was released a month earlier, into the UK charts. The album also featured the UK Top 40 hits, \\"Scooby Snacks\\" (UK No. 22), \\"The Fun Lovin' Criminal\\" (UK No. 26) and \\"King Of New York\\" (UK No. 28). The subject of latter touched on the imprisonment of Italian-American mafioso John Gotti, the wannabe gangsters emulating his style, and his fans and followers in his community that maintained his innocence. The biggest hit, \\"Scooby Snacks\\", features samples from films by Quentin Tarantino and a guitar sample from Tones On Tail song \\"Movement of Fear\\", interspersed with rap verses and a sung, anthemic, chorus. Come Find Yourself had a slow rise up the UK Albums Chart, finally peaking at No. 7 and spending well over a year in the chart, however it failed to make any impact in the US. The success of the album prompted the re-release of \\"Scooby Snacks\\" as a single, alongside a cover of the 10cc classic \\"I'm Not In Love\\", which this time reached UK No. 12.  100% Colombian, released in August 1998 by Virgin Records, had a far grittier sound to it tempered by three upbeat songs, and several downtempo tracks, including \\"Love Unlimited\\", a tribute to Barry White. \\"Korean Bodega\\", one of the aforementioned upbeat songs, was the biggest hit from the album, reaching No. 15, their second-highest placing single so far after the re-release of \\"Scooby Snacks\\".  In June 1999 the band played at Glastonbury Festival on the Pyramid Stage. Their December 1999 album Mimosa, released by EMI was a compilation album consisting mostly of laid back lounge style covers and different versions of earlier released tracks. While making reasonable sales, the album was their weakest selling album yet and remained so for some years. It was around this time, in 1999, that Steve Borgovini left the band. He was replaced by Maxwell \\"Mackie\\" Jayson. A permanent replacement was found in 2003 in the form of Mark Reid (aka Frank Benbini) from Leicester, United Kingdom, who had previously worked with the band as Jayson's technician.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about Kwon Hyuk-Chul? Options:  A. He has spent a lot of time around nuclear warheads.  B. He has spent a lot of time with Donald Trump.  C. not enough information  D.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:  and the situation: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B.  Answer the following question: Which case would see slower movement, case A or case C? A:","output":"Between case A (Mars) and case C (Jupiter), case C would exhibit slower movement. This is because Jupiter is farther from the Sun than Mars is. In the Solar System, a planet's year or sidereal period is dependent on its distance from the Sun. The farther a planet is from its star, the longer the distance it has to cover in its orbit. Additionally, its speed is also slower due to the reduced effect of the star's gravitational influence. In the case of Mars, it is situated closer to the Sun than Jupiter, resulting in a stronger gravitational pull. Consequently, Mars moves more quickly in its orbit than Jupiter does. To put this into context, Mars takes about 687 Earth days (approximately 1.88 Earth years) to orbit the Sun, while Jupiter requires 4,333 Earth days (approximately 11.86 Earth years) to complete its orbital period.  As the planets approach their periastron or closest point to the star, their speed increases due to the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy. On the other hand, as the planets recede to their apastron or farthest point from the Sun, their speed decreases. For both Mars and Jupiter, these changes in speed happen throughout their respective orbits. Therefore, observing the motion of these two planets through a telescope would reveal that Jupiter (case C) exhibits a slower movement compared to Mars (case A)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation -23*u - 977 + 1115 = 0 for u, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation First, we will simplify the given equation by combining the constant terms: -23*u + (1115 - 977) = 0 -23*u + 138 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable (u) Now, we will isolate the variable u by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation: -23*u = -138 Step 3: Divide by the coefficient of the variable To find the value of u, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of u, which is -23: u = (-138) / (-23) Step 4: Calculate the value of u Now we can calculate the value of u: u = 138 / 23 u = 6 So, the solution to the equation -23*u - 977 + 1115 = 0 is u = 6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"Don't worry about provoking grizzly bears; they come that way.\\" said in German?","output":"In German, the phrase \\"Don't worry about provoking grizzly bears; they come that way.\\" can be translated as \\"Mach dir keine Sorgen, Grizzlybären zu provozieren; sie sind von Natur aus so.\\"  Here's a breakdown of the translation: - Mach dir keine Sorgen: This translates to \\"Don't worry\\" or \\"Do not be concerned\\" and is an informal way to address a person to help them not worry about something. - Grizzlybären zu provozieren: This means \\"provoking grizzly bears\\" and is the action that one should not worry about. - sie: This translates to \\"they\\" and refers to the grizzly bears being mentioned. - sind von Natur aus: This part translates to \\"are by nature\\" or \\"come that way\\" and explains the inherent characteristic of the grizzly bears. - so: This translates to \\"so\\" or \\"like this\\" and is used to emphasize the characteristics of grizzly bears mentioned before.

Does the word \\"give\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"The word \\"give\\" appears in both sentences, but the context and implied meanings are different in each case. In the first sentence, \\"Can I give you the children for the weekend?\\" the use of \\"give\\" suggests that the speaker is seeking help, most likely temporary care, for the children while they attend to other responsibilities or activities during the weekend. In this case, to \\"give\\" means to temporarily entrust the care of the children to someone else. This use of \\"give\\" refers to a transfer of responsibility and supervision. In the second sentence, \\"Can I give you my keys while I go in the pool?\\" the use of \\"give\\" refers to temporarily handing over an object (the keys) for the purpose of safekeeping while the speaker engages in an activity where having the keys would be inconvenient or unsafe (swimming in the pool). In this context, \\"give\\" means to provide or pass on an item for a specific purpose. While the underlying concept of transferring something from one party to another is consistent in both sentences, the nature of what is being transferred and the reasons behind it differ. In the first sentence, the transfer is about the responsibility and care of children; it goes beyond simply giving an item. In the second sentence, the transfer is limited to physical possession of the keys, with no additional responsibilities implied. To summarize, although the word \\"give\\" is used in both sentences, the context and meaning change based on the specific situations described. In the first sentence, \\"give\\" is about entrusting the care and supervision of children, whereas in the second sentence, it has a more straightforward connotation of passing an object for safekeeping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: (A). no. (B). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Why is economics considered a social science? Economics is considered a social science because it examines the behavior of individuals, groups, and organizations in the management and allocation of resources. The primary focus of economics is to understand and predict human behavior in relation to scarce resources, which include not only money but also time, talent, and natural resources.  As a social science, economics employs scientific methods and systematic inquiry to study the various ways in which people make choices and interact with one another within the context of their economic activities. Some of the key areas that economics focuses on are the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, and the resulting impact on overall wealth and welfare. It also examines how government policies and institutions can affect economic performance. Economists use both quantitative (e.g., statistical models, econometrics) and qualitative (e.g., case studies, historical analysis) research methods to study these phenomena. In doing so, they aim to generate theories and models that can help explain complex economic behavior and inform public policy decisions. By linking individual choices to larger economic systems, economists are able to shed light on some of the most pressing social issues, such as unemployment, income inequality, and environmental sustainability. In summary, economics is considered a social science because it deals with the study of human behavior in relation to the allocation and distribution of resources. It employs scientific methods to investigate economic relationships and patterns, with the ultimate goal of improving public policy and social welfare.  Question 2: Is philosophy considered a social science? Available choices: (A). no. (B). yes. Answer: (A). no. Philosophy is not considered a social science because it deals with the study of fundamental questions and concepts in areas such as existence, knowledge, logic, ethics, and aesthetics. While social sciences focus on the empirical study of human behavior and societal structures, philosophy uses critical thinking and logical arguments to explore abstract ideas and seek answers to profound questions about the nature of reality, truth, and morality. Philosophy can be broken down into several branches, such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics. While some branches of philosophy may occasionally intersect with social sciences, its primary method of inquiry is through rational discussion and the development of philosophical theories, rather than empirical observation and experimentation. Although philosophy and social sciences both strive to improve our understanding of the world and human experience, they use different approaches and methods. Philosophy seeks to understand the conceptual foundations of human thought, while social sciences aim to systematically study human behavior in social contexts.  Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking why economics is considered a social science, while question 2 is asking whether philosophy is considered a social science or not. Both questions involve the classification of academic disciplines as social sciences, but they are focused on two different subjects - economics and philosophy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, you'll want to get rid of the number (39) being added to the 33*r term. You can achieve this by subtracting 39 from both sides of the equation: 33*r + 39 - 39 = 6 - 39 This simplifies to: 33*r = -33 Step 2: Solve for r. Now, you have an equation of the form 33*r = -33. To isolate r and find its value, you'll need to divide both sides of the equation by 33: (33*r) / 33 = (-33) / 33 Both the numerator and denominator on the left side of the equation have 33 in common, so they cancel each other: r = (-33) / 33 Step 3: Simplify the expression.

He's reticent at first but Mike's congenial attitude and a shared appreciation for classic rock hits gradually dissolves James' apprehensions. As their journey progresses, Mike, beneath his hearty exterior, struggles with his quiet dilemmas - a terminal diagnosis and a stained rapport with his estranged son, Will. During their long trip, Mike and James form an unlikely friendship as they share stories of life, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit. James confides about the horrors of war, the comrades he lost, and the struggle to adjust to civilian life. Mike shares his regrets about his strained relationships and the fear of his impending demise. Upon learning about Mike's situation, James hatches a plan, he decides to reconcile Mike with his estranged son, Will, who also happens to be a discharged soldier, tormented by his own war no less real than his father's.

But Mr Jones, whose place in the cabinet was taken by his former deputy Stephen Crabb on Tuesday, told BBC Wales that whoever had made such claims was motivated by \\"personal spite\\" against him. The former Welsh secretary said he had spoken to Nick Ramsay, Antoinette Sandbach and Janet Finch-Saunders last week, and they had all told him they were being reinstated, but that the announcement was not being made until now. Mr Ramsay has been appointed shadow finance minister, Ms Sandbach is shadow environment minister, Ms Finch-Saunders will speak for her party on local government and Mr Asghar becomes shadow minister for equalities and sport. The roles had previously been shared out among other members of the shadow cabinet. Lockstep The assembly vote which led to problems on the devolution of income tax revolved around whether the so-called lockstep should remain. This is the rule which means that if income tax was devolved then Welsh ministers would not be able to alter individual tax bands. Instead, any changes up or down would have to be mirrored across all of the bands. Mr Davies wanted Wales to have more flexibility, while Mr Jones wanted the lockstep to remain. The two men had a public disagreement over the issue. The four AMs voted against Mr Davies and were effectively sacked for siding with Mr Jones and, ultimately, siding with the prime minister because the lockstep was the policy of the party at Westminster and was the model being devolved. The affair became a major embarrassment for the party at Cardiff Bay, and made it an easy target for Carwyn Jones during First Minister's Questions. It was also said that Downing Street was unhappy with the state of affairs and the issue had led to criticism of the role played by the former Welsh secretary. Solution:","output":"Part #1: Identify the main topic of the text. Usage: The main topic of the text is the political tensions and reshuffling within the Welsh Conservative Party involving disagreement over income tax devolution and lockstep policy. Part #2: Condense the main topic into a single-sentence summary. Usage: Four Welsh Conservative AMs return to the front bench after rebelling against their leader during a vote on income tax devolution and lockstep policy, amid tensions and a cabinet reshuffle. This meets the criteria by summarizing the core topic of the text in a succinct manner, referencing the central event (vote on income tax devolution), and contextualizing it with the relevant political changes (tensions, cabinet reshuffle)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context:  The Vikes fell to 4-3 with a loss at home on Monday Night Football to the New England Patriots. The Pats, who came out passing instead of bothering to even try challenging the Vikings rush defense, got out to an early lead on the opening drive as QB Tom Brady hit WR Reche Caldwell for a 6-yard touchdown pass. Kicker Stephen Gostkowski connected on a 23-yard field goal early in the second quarter. Brady threw his second of what would turn out to be four touchdown passes, this time to TE Benjamin Watson just before halftime to give the Pats a 17-0 lead. The Vikes finally got on the board as RB Mewelde Moore returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown early in the third quarter. That would be all the Vikes could muster as Brady threw his final two touchdowns to wide receivers Troy Brown and Chad Jackson respectively to close out the scoring. Which team had the lead at the start of the second quarter?","output":"Based on the context provided, the New England Patriots had the lead at the start of the second quarter.

Article: With its 190 million inhabitants, Brazil has the largest population in Latin America and ranks fifth in the world.  However, Brazil's population growth rate has dropped greatly and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. This achievement really becomes the envy of many other Third World countries. Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes at reducing population growth-----but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine  _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment  plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas. Globo, Brazil's most popular television network, shows three hours of soaps six nights a week, while three others show at least one hour a night. Most TV series are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities. \\"Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction , they describe middle and upper class values-----not many children, different attitudes towards sex, women working,\\" says Martine. \\"They sent this image to all parts of Brazil and made people conscious of other patterns of behavior and other values, which were put into a very attractive package.\\" Meanwhile, the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers. \\"This led to an enormous change in consumption patterns and showed that consumption was in contradiction with unlimited reproduction,\\" says Martine.

From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, \\"Space Oddity\\", and later in the song \\"Heroes\\", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that \\"in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.\\"Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as \\"particularly deliberate and distinctive\\".

Write a summary based on this article: “There has been unbelievable, unprecedented obstruction,” Mr. Reid said as he set in motion the steps for the vote on Thursday. “The Senate is a living thing, and to survive it must change as it has over the history of this great country. To the average American, adapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense.”      Republicans accused Democrats of irreparably damaging the character of an institution that in many ways still operates as it did in the 19th century, and of disregarding the constitutional prerogative of the Senate as a body of “advice and consent” on presidential nominations.      “You think this is in the best interest of the United States Senate and the American people?” asked the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, sounding incredulous.      “I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you’ll regret this. And you may regret it a lot sooner than you think,” he added.      Mr. Obama applauded the Senate’s move. “Today’s pattern of obstruction, it just isn’t normal,” he told reporters at the White House. “It’s not what our founders envisioned. A deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the results of an election is not normal, and for the sake of future generations we can’t let it become normal.”      Photo      Only three Democrats voted against the measure.      The changes will apply to all 1,183 executive branch nominations that require Senate confirmation — not just cabinet positions but hundreds of high- and midlevel federal agency jobs and government board seats.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      This fight was a climax to the bitter debate between the parties over electoral mandates and the consequences of presidential elections. Republicans, through their frequent use of the various roadblocks that congressional procedure affords them, have routinely thwarted Democrats. Democrats, in turn, have accused Republicans of effectively trying to nullify the results of a presidential election they lost, whether by trying to dismantle his health care law or keep Mr. Obama from filling his cabinet.

Republicans saw their battle as fighting an overzealous president who, left to his own devices, would stack a powerful and underworked court with judges sympathetic to his vision of big-government liberalism, pushing its conservative tilt sharply left. The court is of immense political importance to both parties because it often decides questions involving White House and federal agency policy.      Republicans proposed eliminating three of its 11 full-time seats. When Democrats balked, the Republicans refused to confirm any more judges, saying they were exercising their constitutional check against the executive.      Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, said Democrats had undercut the minority party’s rights forever. “We have weakened this body permanently, undermined it for the sake of an incompetent administration,” he said. “What a tragedy.”      With the filibuster rules now rewritten — the most significant change since the Senate lowered its threshold to break a filibuster from two-thirds of the body to three-fifths, or 60 votes, in 1975 — the Senate can proceed with approving a backlog of presidential nominations.      Photo      There are now 59 nominees to executive branch positions and 17 nominees to the federal judiciary awaiting confirmation votes. The Senate acted immediately on Thursday when it voted with just 55 senators affirming to move forward on the nomination of Patricia A. Millett, a Washington lawyer nominated to the Washington appeals court. Two other nominees to that court, Cornelia T. L. Pillard and Robert L. Wilkins, are expected to be confirmed when the Senate returns from its Thanksgiving recess next month.      The filibuster or threats to use it have frustrated presidents and majority parties since the early days of the republic. Over the years, and almost always after the minority had made excessive use of it, the Senate has adjusted the rules. Until 1917, the year Woodrow Wilson derided his antiwar antagonists as “a little group of willful men” who had rendered the government helpless through blocking everything in front of it, there was no rule to end debate. From 1917 to 1975, the bar for cutting off debate was set at two-thirds of the Senate.      Some would go even further than Thursday’s action. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said that he would like to see the next fight on the filibuster to be to require senators to actually stand on the floor and talk if they wanted to stall legislation.      The gravity of the situation was reflected in an unusual scene on the Senate floor: Nearly all 100 senators were in their seats, rapt, as their two leaders debated.      As the two men went back and forth, Mr. McConnell appeared to realize there was no way to persuade Mr. Reid to change his mind. As many Democrats wore large grins, Republicans looked dour as they lost on a futile, last-ditch parliamentary attempt by Mr. McConnell to overrule the majority vote.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      When Mr. McConnell left the chamber, he said, “I think it’s a time to be sad about what’s been done to the United States Senate.” ||||| The Senate voted Thursday to change its rules to prevent the minority party from filibustering any nominations other than nods to the Supreme Court.

Reid said the change was necessary to get the Senate working again.      “It’s time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete,” Reid said on the Senate floor.      “The American people believe Congress is broken. The American people believe the Senate is broken. And I agree.”      The procedural motion is known as the nuclear option because critics warn it would obliterate bipartisan relations in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ripped Reid for triggering it.      McConnell accused Democrats of picking a “fake fight over judges” to try and “distract the public” from the problems of ObamaCare.      “It only reinforces the narrative of party willing to do or say just about anything to get its way,” said McConnell. “One again, Democrats are threatening to break the rules of the Senate ... in order to change the rules of the Senate,” he said.      “And over what? Over a court that doesn’t have enough work to do.”      After the vote, McConnell declined to comment on the prospect of Republican retaliation.      “I don’t think this is the time to be talking about reprisals. I think it’s a time to be sad about what’s been done to the United States Senate,” he said.      The specific procedural vote to change the Senate's rules was to sustain the ruling of the chair that nominees need 60 votes to advance to final passage.      Democrats voted against sustaining the ruling of the chair and in favor of changing the Senate's rules. The final vote was 48-52.      In his floor comments, Reid said the filibuster had rendered the Senate’s basic duty of confirming presidential nominees “completely unworkable.”      “The need for change is so, so very obvious,” he said.      “These nominees deserve at least an up-or-down vote, but Republican filibusters deny them a fair vote, any vote, and deny the president his team.”      The two parties have effectively changed sides on the nuclear option since Democrats gained control of the upper chamber in the 2006 election.      Republicans accused Democrats of hypocrisy for embracing a controversial tactic they criticized in 2005, when Republicans threatened to go nuclear to move then-President George W. Bush’s stalled nominees.      “To change the rules in the Senate can't be done by a simple majority. It can only be done if there is extended debate by 67 votes,” Reid said in May of 2005.      “They are talking about doing something illegal. They are talking about breaking the rules to change the rules, and that is not appropriate. That is not fair, and it is not right,” he said in April of that year.      But Democrats countered that McConnell was ready to vote for it when then-Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) wanted to strip the minority of the power to filibuster eight years ago.      The dispute that triggered the rules change was over three of President Obama’s nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the second-most-powerful court in the nation.      Republicans have blocked the nominations of Patricia Millett, an appellate litigator; Cornelia Pillard, a Georgetown Law School professor; and Robert Wilkins, a judge on the District Court for the District of Columbia.      Reid said Republicans floated a last-minute deal by offering to confirm one of the D.C. Circuit nominees to avoid the rules change.      The Senate voted 55 to 43 immediately after the rules change to end a filibuster of Millett.      Reid proposed scheduling a final vote on her nomination after the Thanksgiving recess if Republicans agreed to speed up consideration of the defense authorization bill.      Reid had come under growing pressure from his conference to use the nuclear option to fill the court's vacancies.      Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), an outspoken proponent of rules reform, circulated a memo to the media Thursday morning defending the tactic.      He noted that then-Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) used it on March 5, 1980, when he eliminated filibusters on motions to proceed to nominations.      He argued the Senate has changed its procedures by a simple majority vote at least 18 times since 1977.      “The notion that changing Senate procedure with a simple majority vote is ‘changing the rules by breaking the rules’ is false,” he wrote.      — This story was posted at 10:22 a.m. and updated at 2:20 p.m. ||||| Senate Majority Leader Sen.

(Associated Press)      Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., speaks to the media on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2013. The Senate is nearing a potential showdown on curbing the power that the Republican... (Associated Press)      The Democrat majority in the Senate on Thursday pushed through a major rules change, one that curbs the power of the Republican minority to block President Barack Obama's nominations for high-level judgeships and cabinet and agency officials. The move was certain to only deepen the partisan divide that has crippled passage of legislation.      Infuriated over repeated Republican blocks of Obama candidates for critical judgeships, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took the dramatic step, calling it \\"simple fairness\\" because the change would work in Republicans' favor whenever they regain the White House and a Senate majority.      Current Senate rules allowed any one member of the chamber, using a tactic called a filibuster, to block a president's nominations unless 60 of the 100 Senators vote to move forward with the nomination. The 60-vote threshold has proven difficult for Democrats to assemble given they hold only a 55-45 edge over the Republicans in a hyper-partisan political climate and stalemated Congress.      \\"The gears of government have to work,\\" Obama said shortly after the Senate vote. In a brief White House appearance to congratulate his fellow Democrats, Obama complained that the old filibuster rule allowed opposition senators to avoid voting their conscience on legislation on which a yes vote could put them under attack from the far rightwing of the party.      Known as the \\"nuclear option,\\" Reid said the rules change would help break partisan gridlock that has sent voter approval of Congress to record lows. He forced a vote on requiring only 51 votes to end a filibuster. The change would not end the 60-vote threshold for overcoming blocking action for Supreme Court nominees or legislation.      The change is the most far-reaching to filibuster rules since 1975, when a two-thirds requirement for cutting off filibusters against legislation and all nominations was eased to today's three-fifths, or 60-vote, level. It would make it harder for the opposition party to block presidential appointments.      The latest battle is over Obama's choices to fill three vacancies at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Since Oct. 31, Republican filibusters derailed the president's nominations of District Judge Robert L. Wilkins, law professor Cornelia Pillard and attorney Patricia Millett for those lifelong appointments. The D.C. Circuit Court is viewed as second only to the Supreme Court in power because it rules on disputes over White House and federal agency actions. The circuit's eight sitting judges are divided evenly between Democratic and Republican presidential appointees. Three seats are vacant.      \\"They have decided that their base demands a permanent campaign against the president and maximum use of every tool available,\\" said Democrat Sen. Jeff Merkley, a leading advocate of revamping filibuster rules that have been used a record number of times during the Obama presidency. He said Republican tactics are \\"trumping the appropriate exercise of advice and consent.\\"      Republicans said they are weary of repeated Democratic threats to rewrite the rules. They say Democrats similarly obstructed some of President George W. Bush's nominees and argue that the D.C. Circuit's caseload is too low, which Democrats reject.      \\"I suspect the reason they may be doing it is hoping Republicans overreact, and it's the only thing that they could think of that would change the conversation about Obamacare,\\" said Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, using the nickname for Obama's troubled health care law. \\"But we're not that dumb.\\"      Reid use of the nuclear option procedural move would allow him to change the filibuster rule with just 51 votes, meaning Democrats could push it through without Republican support. Senate rules are more commonly changed with 67 votes.      Nomination fights are not new in the Senate, but as the hostility has grown the two sides have been edging toward a collision for much of this year.      ___      Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report. ||||| The Senate approved a historic rules change on Thursday by eliminating the use of the filibuster on all presidential nominees except those to the U.S. Supreme Court.      Invoking the long-threatened “nuclear option” means that most of President Barack Obama’s judicial and executive branch nominees no longer need to clear a 60-vote threshold to reach the Senate floor and get an up-or-down vote.      Text Size -      +      reset Mitch McConnell responds In 90 secs: What's driving the day      Speaking at the White House, Obama praised the Senate action, accusing Republicans of attempting to block his nominees based on politics alone, not on the merits of the nominee.      “This isn’t obstruction on substance, on qualifications. It’s just to gum up the works,” he said.      (PHOTOS: Harry Reid’s career)      Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) used the nuclear option Thursday morning, meaning he called for a vote to change the Senate rules by a simple majority vote. It passed, 52 to 48. Three Democrats voted against changing the rules — Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.      “It’s time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete,” Reid said in a lengthy floor speech on Thursday morning.      A furious Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who tried to recess the Senate for the day before the rules change could get a vote, said after the minority’s power was limited by Democrats: “I don’t think this is a time to be talking about reprisal. I think it’s a time to be sad about what has been done to the United States Senate.”      But McConnell quickly noted that Republicans could fix the problem in the upcoming midterm elections if they regain the majority: “The solution to this problem is an election. The solution to this problem is at the ballot box. We look forward to having a great election on 2014.”      The debate over the filibuster — and specifically its use on D.C. Circuit nominees — has been raging for nearly a decade, stretching back to when George W. Bush was president and Democrats were in the minority. But changing the Senate rules has always been avoided through a piecemeal deal, a gentleman’s agreement or a specific solution, not a historic change to the very fabric of the Senate.      (Also on POLITICO: Reid: GOP playing with fire on judges)      But since Obama’s nomination, the “nuclear option” has reared its head three times in less than a year — each time getting closer to the edge. Many in the Senate privately expected that this go-round would be yet another example of saber rattling, but Reid said pressure was increasing within his own party to change the rules.      The blockade of three consecutive nominees to a powerful appellate court was too much for Democrats to handle — and Reid felt compelled to pull the trigger, explaining that “this is the way it has to be.”      It didn’t take long for Republicans to begin circulating both Reid’s and Obama’s past statements opposing a rules change. But the majority leader said that things escalated to a level that even he had not thought possible in 2005, when a “Gang of 14” banded together to stop a rules change.      “They have done everything they can to deny the fact that Obama has been elected and then reelected,” he said. “I have a right to change how I feel about things.”      (Earlier on POLITICO: Court nominees: Battleground for partisan politics)      Senate Democrats were quick to use their newfound powers, voting in the early afternoon to end the filibuster on Patricia Millett’s nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The vote was 55-43, with two senators voting present. Before the change earlier Thursday, Millett would have needed 60 votes to clear the procedural hurdle and move on to a confirmation vote. But now, she needed just 51 to advance.      In his speech, Obama noted that in the few decades before he took office, about 20 nominees were filibustered. Since he took office, close to 30 judicial and political nominees have had their nominations blocked.      “It’s no secret that the American people have probably never been more frustrated with Washington, and one of the reasons why that is, is that over the past five years, we’ve seen an unprecedented pattern of obstruction in Congress that’s prevented too much of the American people’s business from getting done,” Obama said. “Today’s pattern of obstruction just isn’t normal. We can’t allow it to become normal.”      Obama also cited the filibuster of a gun control bill earlier this year, although Thursday’s rule change would preserve the filibuster for Supreme Court picks and legislation. |||||","output":"In the past, there was a big disagreement between Democrats and Republicans about how the Senate works and how they choose people for important jobs. Mr. Reid, a Democrat, believed the Senate needed to change its rules so it could work better. Republicans disagreed and believed that changing the rules would damage the Senate. Mr. Obama, who was the president at that time, supported changing the rules and said that not allowing him to choose people for important jobs was not normal. He said they couldn't let this become the normal way of doing things in the Senate. The changes finally happened and affected many jobs in the government, making it easier for people chosen by the president to be confirmed without too many delays. This was called the \\"nuclear option,\\" which involved changing the Senate rules by majority vote. The vote passed because more than 50 senators voted for the change. In the end, only 3 Democrats voted against it. This historic change made it so that most presidential nominees wouldn't need 60 votes to get an up-or-down vote; they would only need 51. This helped to break the disagreements between both parties in the Senate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Which types of boards have four holes where the binding threads were laced through?  The boards of the covers, previously assumed to be limewood, are now thought to be birch, an unusual wood in later bindings, but one easily available in northern England.  Both have four holes where the binding threads were laced through; the two threads were run round the inner edges of the cover and knotted back at the holes.  The front cover has an additional 12 holes where the ends of the cords for the raised framing lines went through, at the four corners of the two main frames, and the ends of the horizontal bars between the interlace panels and the central vine motif.The stitching of the binding uses \\"Coptic sewing\\", that is \\"flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round one another in a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)\\"  Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords.  Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel.  In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface.  This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique.  The first appearance of the cords or supports that these \\"unsupported\\" bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques.

The earliest evidence of cultivated rice, found by the Yangtze River, is carbon-dated to 8,000 years ago. Farming gave rise to the Jiahu culture (7000 to 5800 BC). At Damaidi in Ningxia, 3,172 Neolithic signs in China dating to 6000–5000 BC have been discovered, \\"featuring 8,453 individual characters such as the sun, moon, stars, gods and scenes of hunting or grazing\\". These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 7000 BC, Dadiwan culture from 5800 BC to 5400 BC, Damaidi around 6000 BC and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BC. Some scholars have suggested that Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BC) were the earliest Chinese writing system. Excavation of a Peiligang culture site in Xinzheng county, Henan, found a community that flourished in 5,500 to 4,900 BC, with evidence of agriculture, constructed buildings, pottery, and burial of the dead.

Atomic clocks use the frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the most common atoms used is caesium, most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations. Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium atoms.

She has an elder brother, Anand. Her father is a diamond merchant. She is of Sindhi descent. Context: In 2005, at the age of 15, she played the female lead in Chand Sa Roshan Chehra which was a commercial failure at the box office. The same year, she made her debut in Telugu cinema with Sri and in Tamil cinema with Kedi in 2006. IndiaGlitz in its review called Tamannaah as the \\"real scene-stealer\\" and stated that she \\"walks away with all honors\\", adding that her characters have shades of the characters played by Vijayashanti in Mannan (1992) and Ramya Krishnan in Padayappa (1999).  Her first release of 2007 was Shakti Chidambaram's Viyabari in which she played the role of a journalist who wants to write an article about a successful entrepreneur played by S. J. Suryah. The film opened to negative reviews and flopped at the box office, but Tamannaah received praise for her performance. She got her breakthrough with Sekhar Kammula's Happy Days and Balaji Sakthivel's Kalloori, both of which featured Tamannaah as a college student. She won critical acclaim for her performances in both films. The commercial success of Happy Days and Kalloori established her career as an actress in both Telugu and Tamil films. Her performance in the latter earned her a nomination at the 56th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Tamil Actress category.  Her first release of 2008 was the Telugu film Kalidasu directed by debutante G. Ravicharan Reddy. She was paired with debutante Sushanth, the grandson of actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao. Upon release, the film opened to moderate reviews and critics felt that she looked good and very romantic but had less scope to perform. The film was an average grosser at the box office. She later made a cameo appearance in the Telugu film Ready followed by another cameo appearance in the Telugu - Tamil bilingual Ninna Nedu Repu titled Netru Indru Naalai in Tamil.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  Reacher shoots the zec in the head.  for the following movie plot:  In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a man drives a van into a parking garage across the Allegheny River from PNC Park and, after dropping a quarter into the meter, readies a sniper rifle. He takes aim and kills five people on the river's North Shore Trail from long range before fleeing in the van. The police soon arrive at the scene of the murder, headed by Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo), and discover a shell casing as well as the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint taken from the coin points to James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former U.S. Army sniper. When the police raid his house, they find the van, equipment for reloading rifle cartridges, the rifle in question, and Barr asleep in his bed. During an interrogation by Emerson and the District Attorney, Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), Barr is offered a choice between life in prison in exchange for a full confession or guaranteed death row, as Rodin has never failed to convict. Thinking Barr is going to confess when he takes the notepad, they are bewildered when he instead writes \\"Get Jack Reacher\\". Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is a drifter and former U.S. Army Military Police Corps officer. He arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news report about Barr and the shooting. Emerson and Rodin deny Reacher's request to view the evidence but agree to let him see the suspect. Barr, as it turns out, was brutally attacked by fellow inmates while in police custody and is now in a coma. Reacher meets Barr's defense attorney, counselor Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), the District Attorney's daughter, who's been saddled with the apparently hopeless task of saving Barr from the death penalty. Helen says she can arrange for Reacher to see the evidence if he will become her lead investigator. Reacher retorts that he is not interested in clearing Barr. He reveals that Barr had gone on a killing spree during his tour in Iraq but was not prosecuted because, unbeknownst to Barr, his victims were under investigation for numerous rapes and the U.S. Army wanted them forgotten.

It can hybridize with Lelwel hartebeest to make the Kenya Highland hartebeest ( Alcelaphus buselaphus lelwel x cokii ) .  - Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus \\"Bison\\" within the subfamily Bovinae.  - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania.  - Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC). Its capital and largest city is Nairobi. Kenya's territory lies on the equator and overlies the East African Rift covering a diverse and expansive terrain that extends roughly from Lake Victoria to Lake Turkana (formerly called Lake Rudolf) and further south-east to the Indian Ocean. It is bordered by Tanzania to the south and southwest, Uganda to the west, South Sudan to the north-west, Ethiopia to the north and Somalia to the north-east. Kenya covers , and had a population of approximately 45 million people in July 2014.  - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\".  - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.  - An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats. A group of antelope is called a herd.  - The African Great Lakes are a series of lakes constituting the part of the Rift Valley lakes in and around the East African Rift. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world by area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest freshwater lake by volume and depth. Collectively, they contain 31,000 km (7400 cu mi) of water, which is more than either Lake Baikal or the North American Great Lakes, and constitutes about 25% of the planet's unfrozen surface fresh water.  - A herd is a social grouping of certain animals of the same species, either wild or domestic. The form of collective animal behavior associated with this is referred to as \\"herding\\".  - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla.  - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya. It is famous for having the Nairobi National Park, the world's only game reserve found within a major city. The city and its surrounding area also form Nairobi County, whose current governor is Evans Kidero and Deputy Governor is Jonathan Mueke.    What is the relationship between 'coke's hartebeest' and 'subspecies'? A:","output":"Coke's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus cokii), also known as kongoni, is a subspecies of the hartebeest, which is an antelope native to Kenya and Tanzania. In this context, the term 'subspecies' refers to a distinct, geographically defined variant within a species. Subspecies often exhibit some genetic differentiation, physical characteristics, and behavioral traits that set them apart from other populations of the same species.  The relationship between Coke's hartebeest and subspecies can be understood by examining the differences between Coke's hartebeest and other hartebeest subspecies. While all belonging to the Alcelaphus buselaphus species, each subspecies has adapted to its specific geographic range, sharing a common lineage but exhibiting variations in traits such as size, coloration, and horn shape. These differences enable the subspecies to adapt to the unique environmental conditions in their respective habitats. In summary, Coke's hartebeest is a subspecies of the hartebeest species. The term 'subspecies' denotes a geographically defined variation within a species, with unique characteristics that have evolved in response to specific environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here are the definitions of logical operators that you can use while generating command:   1. count: returns the number of rows in the view.   2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view.   3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row.   4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments.   5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column.   6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column.   7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column.   8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column.   9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal.   10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance.   11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument.   12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments.   13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument.   14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument.   15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument.   16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table   17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.   20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. Problem:select the rows whose surface record fuzzily matches to carpet . there is only one such row in the table . the tournament record of this unqiue row is kyoto . Solution:","output":"In this task, we need to generate the command in terms of logical operations that selects rows from the table where the surface record is close to \\"carpet\\" and there is only one such row in the table. We also know that the tournament record of this unique row is \\"Kyoto\\". Following the given definitions of logical operators, we can generate the command like this: 1. First, we filter the rows whose surface record is approximately equal to \\"carpet\\" using the \\"round_eq\\" and \\"filter_eq\\" operators: {   filter_round_eq(view, \\"surface\\", \\"carpet\\") } 2. Next, we check if there is only one row in the filtered view using the \\"only\\" operator: {   only(filter_round_eq(view, \\"surface\\", \\"carpet\\")) } 3. Finally, we filter the rows with the tournament record of \\"Kyoto\\" using the \\"filter_eq\\" operator: {   filter_eq(only(filter_round_eq(view, \\"surface\\", \\"carpet\\")), \\"tournament\\", \\"Kyoto\\") } The generated command combines all three logical operations to select the relevant row from the table whose surface record is close to \\"carpet\\" and has a tournament record of \\"Kyoto\\"."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please download Flash from the Adobe download website.      President Nicolas Sarkozy has surged into the lead in election opinion polls following his handling of the crisis in Toulouse where a gunman is under siege suspected of killing of seven people.      The first survey since Monday's killings predicted Mr Sarkozy would narrowly beat his Socialist challenger in the first round of a presidential election next month.      The poll of 1,000 people, carried out on Monday and Tuesday, put Mr Sarkozy on 30% in the first round and Francois Hollande on 28%.      However, it showed Mr Hollande would win a second-round run-off by a margin of 8%.      The two rivals were neck and neck a week ago.      :: France Shootings - See The Latest      Until now Mr Hollande has enjoyed a large lead over the president, whose economic record and showy style left many voters dissatisfied.      However, Mr Sarkozy's response to Monday's shootings seems to have improved his image.      The rivals suspended their campaigns after three children and a rabbi were shot dead at a Jewish school in Toulouse in southwest France, killings that followed the shooting dead of three soldiers earlier this month.      Suspected gunman Mohammed Merah      The shootings, allegedly by 24-year-old Muslim Mohammed Merah in the name of al Qaeda, have allowed the French president to play his preferred role of protector-in-chief and put a new focus on security, traditionally a strong point.      He has repeatedly appeared on national television giving information on the manhunt and presiding over a ceremony for the fallen soldiers, while Mr Hollande has had little choice but to remain on the sidelines.      Meanwhile, far right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is number three in the polls, says her anti-Islam agenda has been vindicated because the chief suspect in the country's worst killing spree in years is a French Muslim who claims ties to al Qaeda.      France, she says, must \\"wipe out\\" the Islamist threat, arguing it is corrupting the French culture and has not been taken seriously enough by the authorities. ||||| The French interior minister says the suspect in a three-attack killing spree has died after jumping from his apartment window, arm in hand.

It was not immediately known exactly how Mohamed Merah, 24, died.      THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.      TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Loud explosions and sustained gunfire have been heard in Toulouse near the apartment where an Islamic extremist has been holed up in a 32-hour standoff with French police.      There was no way of immediately knowing whether the shooting was coming from the special police to intimidate the suspect or in an exchange volley with him.      The suspect, 24-year-old Mohamed Merah, has boasted of killing seven French citizens _ a rabbi, three Jewish children and three French paratroopers in an attempt to \\"bring France to its knees.\\" They are believed to be the first killings inspired by Islamic radical motives in France in more than a decade.      Authorities said Merah, a French citizen of Algerian descent, espoused a radical form of Islam and had been to Afghanistan and the Pakistani militant stronghold of Waziristan, where he claimed to have received training from al-Qaida.      France's interior minister has said police wanted to capture him alive.      Elite police squads set off sporadic blasts throughout the night and into the morning _ some blew off the apartment's shutters _ in what officials described as a tactic aimed to pressure 24-year-old Merah to give up.      A new set of detonations, known as flash bangs, resounded at about 10:30 a.m. (0930 GMT).      Police were using their advantages _ numbers, firepower and psychological pressure _ in hopes of wearing down Merah, who has had no water, electricity, gas or most likely sleep, and perhaps no food, since the early hours of Wednesday.      Holed up alone in an otherwise evacuated apartment building, Merah clung to his few remaining assets, like a small arsenal and authorities' hopes of taking him alive. He appeared to toy with police negotiators _ first saying he would surrender in the afternoon, then under the cover of darkness, then reneging on those pledges altogether, officials said.      \\"We still want him alive so he can be tried and so the families can mourn properly,\\" Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Europe 1 radio.      They said he told negotiators he killed a rabbi and three young children at a Jewish school on Monday and three French paratroopers last week to avenge the deaths of Palestinian children and to protest the French army's involvement in Afghanistan, as well as a government ban last year on face-covering Islamic veils.      French authorities _ like others across Europe _ have long been concerned about \\"lone-wolf\\" attacks by young, Internet-savvy militants who find radical beliefs online, since they are harder to find and track.      \\"Lone wolves are formidable adversaries,\\" Gueant said.      He defended France's efforts to fight terrorism over the past decade, saying 700 people have been detained and about 60 \\"Islamists with terrorist tendencies\\" are currently in French prisons.      Merah's lawyer predicted a dramatic and somber end to the standoff.      \\"He wants to show he is exceptional, omnipotent, and this approach can only end up as something tragic,\\" Christian Etelin said on news channel i-Tele on Thursday.      He said Merah had tried to join the military but was rejected. He said Merah was also disillusioned after a string of convictions for petty crimes and after efforts to reduce his sentences through work programs failed.      \\"He felt rejected by the periods of detention he was handed out, and for his wish to defend France in the army. Now, he is in a process of hate,\\" Etelin said.      \\"He has no regrets, except not having more time to kill more people, and he boasts that he has brought France to its knees,\\" prosecutor Francois Molins told a news conference Wednesday.      He said the suspect had plans to kill another soldier _ prompting the police raid at around 3 a.m. Wednesday. After it erupted into a firefight, wounding two police, a standoff ensued, with on-and-off negotiations with the suspect that lasted through the night.      ___      Jamey Keaten in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| Toulouse Siege: Gunman Killed In Shootout      To view this content you need Flash and Javascript enabled in your browser. Please download Flash from the Adobe download website.      A man suspected of murdering seven people in France has been killed by police as he jumped from a window still firing wildly at the end of a 32-hour siege.      Mohammed Merah, 23, was shot in the head after officers stormed his flat where he was holed up since early on Wednesday.      He filmed the three recent attacks in Toulouse and Montauban which claimed the lives of three Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi, and three French soldiers, prosecutor Francois Molins said.      Mohammed Merah had been holed up in a flat in Toulouse      Merah claimed to have posted the videos online and police have viewed them.      It comes as al Qaeda linked group Jund al Khilafah, which has claimed responsibility for attacks in Afghanistan and Kazakhstan, said it was behind the shootings in France, according to US monitoring group SITE.      Merah staged a dramatic last stand as he burst out of a bathroom and blasted an automatic weapon at officers, before diving for the window while still shooting.      GRAPHIC: HOW THE SIEGE ENDED      The gunman, who reportedly told negotiators he wanted to \\"die with weapons in his hands\\", was found dead on the ground, according to French interior minister Claude Gueant, who watched the drama while peaking from behind an armoured vehicle outside the flat.      The police unit that carried out the raid \\"had never seen anything like it before,\\" Mr Gueant said, confirming two officers were injured.      Final negotiations were unsuccessful late on Wednesday after Merah indicated he would not surrender and if there was any attempt to seize him he would kill police, according to the minister who ordered the final raid.      Officers entered the property in the southwestern city of Toulouse, creeping step-by-step around the flat, checking each room carefully before they reached the bathroom when Merah burst out, bombarding them with bullets.      Mr Gueant had earlier said police wanted to capture Merah alive.      A series of explosions, known as flash bangs, were heard at 10:30am (9:30am GMT), marking the beginning the end of the stand-off.      Police, who used special video equipment to search for Merah, had been concerned the property might have been booby-trapped.      Mr Gueant told reporters that Merah came out firing \\"with extreme violence\\". Police \\"tried to protect themselves and fired back\\".      \\"Mohammed Merah jumped out the window, gun in hand, continuing to fire. He was found dead on the ground,\\" Mr Gueant added. Heavy gunfire was heard at the scene as the raid took place.      sustained gunfire as police move in on suspect      The building was surrounded by hundreds of police and Merah had been holed up in the flat since an earlier police assault on Wednesday.      Elite police squads had set off sporadic blasts overnight - some which blew off the flat's shutters - and cut off power to the evacuated building as they tried to persuade the suspect to give himself up. Gas supplies had reportedly been cut on Wednesday morning.      Street lights had also been turned off, making Merah more visible to officers with night vision goggles.      Criminologist Sebastian Roche said many questions now needed to be answered about the decision to move in. He told Sky News: \\"They intervene in the middle of the night, then they wait 30 hours, then there is a political decision to terminate this very clearly.\\"      Mr Gueant earlier said: \\"We hope that he is still alive\\" so he could face justice, adding the gunman told negotiators he wanted to \\"die with weapons in his hands\\".      Mr Roche said: \\"The views of Mr Merah have prevailed over the views of the minister of the interior.\\"      Explaining how politicians can control police tactics in France, he said: \\"The minister of the interior is the head of all police services… there is no notion of operational autonomy as you have in the UK.\\"      Merah apparently boasted about carrying out the shootings in separate incidents in the past fortnight.      The suspect, a French citizen of Algerian descent, reportedly bragged to negotiators he was trained by al Qaeda on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.      He was thought to be armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a mini-Uzi submachine pistol and a collection of handguns and when police tried to storm his flat in the early hours of Wednesday, he was reported to have shouted \\"I can see you\\" and fired through the letterbox.      video of toulouse gunman suspect mohammed merah      Officers tried to negotiate with Merah who said he would surrender on Wednesday afternoon, then at night, and he ended up going back on those pledges altogether.      Mr Molins said the suspect boasted about bringing \\"France to its knees\\" and had planned to kill another soldier - prompting the first police raid.      The assault then erupted into a firefight with two police officers hurt as a stand-off developed.      Speaking before Merah's death, Mr Molins said: \\"He has no regrets, except not having more time to kill more people and he boasts that he has brought France to its knees.\\"      Authorities said he had told negotiators he killed a rabbi and three young children at a Jewish school in Toulouse on Monday and three French paratroopers - one in Toulouse and two in Montauban - last week.      He claimed he carried out the shootings to avenge the deaths of Palestinian children and to protest against the French army's involvement in Afghanistan, as well as a government ban last year on face-covering Islamic veils, officials added.      French President Nicolas Sarkozy said authorities \\"tried everything to ensure he (Merah) was caught alive so he could come to trial but that was not possible\\".      Mr Sarkozy said an investigation was under way to see if the suspect had any accomplices.      He also said anyone who regularly visits \\"websites which support terrorism or call for hate or violence will be punished by the law\\".      And he promised a crackdown on anyone who goes abroad \\"for the purposes of indoctrination in terrorist ideology\\".      Mr Molins said the suspect had gone to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region twice and on one occasion was arrested by Afghan police and handed over to US army troops, who put him on a flight back to France.      :: READ MORE - The Gunman's Trail Of Deadly Shootings      :: READ MORE - Behind The Scene At Police Stand-Off      :: READ MORE - A Profile Of Merah      :: READ MORE - Updates On The Siege, As It Happened      Video footage has emerged of Merah, and sources said the suspect had been known to the domestic security service for some years.      He had a police record for several minor offences, some involving violence, Mr Gueant told reporters, \\"but there was no evidence that he was planning such criminal actions\\".      A lawyer who defended Merah last month on charges of driving without a licence told French television that he had been \\"gentle\\" and \\"courteous\\" and that he had told him about his trip to Afghanistan.      The lawyer said he had pointed out to Merah that he would therefore, doubtless be under surveillance, and should not commit even the smallest infraction.      Police and prosecutors said they arrested Merah's mother, brother and his brother's girlfriend as part of the inquiry. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A man named Mohammed Merah was responsible for shooting and killing seven people in France.

Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - First-order logic  also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic  is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as \\"Socrates is a man\\" one can have expressions in the form \\"there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man\\" where \\"there exists\\" is a quantifier and \\"X\\" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers.  - Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas:  - In mathematical logic, Craig's interpolation theorem is a result about the relationship between different logical theories. Roughly stated, the theorem says that if a formula  implies a formula , and the two have at least one atomic variable symbol in common, then there is a third formula , called an interpolant, such that every nonlogical symbol in  occurs both in  and ,  implies , and  implies . The theorem was first proved for first-order logic by William Craig in 1957. Variants of the theorem hold for other logics, such as propositional logic. A stronger form of Craig's theorem for first-order logic was proved by Roger Lyndon in 1959; the overall result is sometimes called the CraigLyndon theorem.  - Philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. The central questions of this study concern what qualifies as science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. This discipline overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and truth.  - The University of California (UC) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California.

Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - A public university is a university that is predominantly funded by public means through a national or subnational government, as opposed to private universities. Whether a national university is considered public varies from one country (or region) to another, largely depending on the specific education landscape.   - Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used in the definitions of nearly all mathematical objects.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Mathematical logic is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. It bears close connections to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems. Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see Logic in computer science for those.  - A formal system or logical calculus is any well-defined system of abstract thought based on the model of mathematics. A formal system need not be mathematical as such; for example, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" imitates the form of Euclid's \\"Elements\\".. Spinoza employed Euclidiean elements such as \\"axioms\\" or \\"primitive truths\\", rules of inferences etc. so that a calculus can be build using these. For nature of such primitive truths, one can consult Tarski's \\"Concept of truth for a formalized language\\".   - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - In mathematics, model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory) from the perspective of mathematical logic. The objects of study are models of theories in a formal language. A set of sentences in a formal language is called a theory; a model of a theory is a structure (e.g. an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory.  - Foundations of mathematics is the study of the philosophical and logical and/or algorithmic basis of mathematics, or, in a broader sense, the mathematical investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. In this latter sense, the distinction between foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics turns out to be quite vague. Foundations of mathematics can be conceived as the study of the basic mathematical concepts (number, geometrical figure, set, function, etc.) and how they form hierarchies of more complex structures and concepts, especially the fundamentally important structures that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories and their models giving a meaning to formulas, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.) also called metamathematical concepts, with an eye to the philosophical aspects and the unity of mathematics. The search for foundations of mathematics is a central question of the philosophy of mathematics; the abstract nature of mathematical objects presents special philosophical challenges.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to David Hilbert's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th Century. Metamathematics provides \\"a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic\\" (Kleene 1952, p. 59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition \\"2+2=4\\" as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition \\"'2+2=4' is valid\\" as belonging to metamathematics.  - The University of California, Berkeley, (also referred to as Berkeley, UC Berkeley, and Cal) is a public research university located in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1868, Berkeley is the oldest of the ten research universities affiliated with the University of California system, and is often cited as the top public university in the United States and around the world.  - Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. Although ontology as a philosophical enterprise is highly theoretical, it also has practical application in information science and technology, such as ontology engineering.  - Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the theory of knowledge.  - Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.

Review: I recently dined at The Cozy Corner Café, a delightful little restaurant nestled in our bustling city, and I am thrilled to say it exceeded my expectations in many ways, notwithstanding a minor hiccup that was promptly resolved. Reflecting on my dining experience, I am excited to share my thoughts, which will hopefully paint a vivid picture of why the place is a must-try! Upon entering The Cozy Corner Café, the warmth of its atmosphere engulfed me, emanating an instant sense of comfort and relaxation, which I believe is no small feat in the competitive world of modern dining. The décor was a lovely mix of rustic charm and contemporary accents, creating a unique blend that felt like an inviting home away from home. Getting our hands on the extensive menu was the next highlight in our culinary sojourn, and it was nothing short of impressive. Featuring an array of appetizing selections across various cuisines, it catered to diverse palates. This speaks volumes about the versatility and thoughtfulness put into curating such an ambitious lineup of gastronomic delights. Now on to the speed bump we encountered: Our orders took longer than anticipated to arrive at our table. The wait was a bit disappointing, considering our expectations were set high by every other aspect we encountered. However, to the restaurant's credit, the kind and genuine server swiftly addressed our concern, admitting they were swamped but were working diligently to get our food to us. This was a constructive acknowledgment of the issue, which impressed us and eased our growing impatience. Once the food did arrive, it became clear that the wait was worth it! Each element on our plates was cooked to perfection and presented with meticulous attention to detail. The flavors danced with perfect harmony, showcasing the chef's expertise in blending myriad textures and tastes. I personally had the seared salmon with roasted root vegetables and lemon-caper sauce, which I can confidently say is my new favorite dish! My companion's penne alfredo showcased a delightfully creamy sauce, which, by itself, merits a return trip to this charming locale. Before concluding, I must commend the restaurant's commitment to using sustainable and locally-sourced ingredients. This not only adds a layer of freshness but also demonstrates a conscious effort to support local farmers and community-based initiatives. All things considered, The Cozy Corner Café is unquestionably worthy of a visit. The ambiance, fantastic menu selections, and focus on locally-sourced ingredients make it easy to overlook the wait time we experienced. Moreover, the restaurant's capacity to accept constructive feedback and promptly address concerns is undoubtedly a strength that sets them apart from the competition. Therefore, I am happy to give them a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars, and I eagerly look forward to my next visit!"},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the following conversation and answer the question.

He says that freedom hardly exists for him, but one thing is he sure of is that the time he spent with Kenta and Stoffe and the other mods was the most enjoyable time of his life. The interview cuts to Kenta and Stoffe running through the streets of Stockholm filmed with a fisheye lens. Later, we see them walking around at the subway station T-Centralen in Stockholm. They meet friends and go around begging people for food, beer and cigarettes. The workers who are passing by get ridiculed by Kenta and Stoffe. Another friend of the guys, Jojje, talks about how alcohol will destroy them in time, but that he doesn't worry much about it right now. The filmmakers have fixed a small apartment for Kenta and Stoffe which is a big difference for the guys who previously slept outdoors or in the apartments of others. Kenta and Stoffe talk about their childhood. Stoffe's father drank himself broke and died in a hospital. Kenta's father tried to strangle him with a tie. Stoffe also remembers that he thought it was fun to play at home when he was little. We see the two guys go to \\"4:an\\", a club for young people.

Given the question \\"What does Casey need to do before treating Alex's wound?\\", is \\"Pull out her phone and call an ambulance\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"No, \\"Pull out her phone and call an ambulance\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What does Casey need to do before treating Alex's wound?\\".  Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Assess the situation: First, Casey needs to determine the severity of Alex's wound and whether it requires immediate professional intervention or if it can be treated on the spot with the first aid kit. 2. If the wound is minor and can be treated on the spot, Casey should:    a. Wash her hands or put on gloves to maintain cleanliness.    b. Clean the wound gently with water and soap, avoiding getting dirt or debris inside the wound.    c. Apply an antiseptic ointment or alcohol wipe to prevent infection.    d. Add a bandage or gauze to protect the wound. 3. If the wound is severe, is not stopping to bleed or seems infected, then Casey might need to call an ambulance for professional medical help. So, calling an ambulance would only be necessary if the wound is severe or beyond Casey's capability to treat with the first aid kit.

You finish drinking the tea. Now, what do you do with the box? Do you drop it on the ground? Or, do you do the right thing and drop it in a trash can? Hopefully, you drop it in the trash can because, besides harming the environment, littering is also very impolite. Recently, a magazine published a list of the most polite cities in the world. They looked three things: did people litter, did shop clerks say thank you and did people hold the door open for the person behind them? The top three politest cities were New York, USA, Zurich, Switzerland, and Toronto, Canada. Hong Kong, China was number 35. Shanghai wasn't even on the list. Does that mean that Shanghai is not a polite city? Well, maybe. There are different ways to judge  politeness but the survey was looking at how a visitor to a city would feel when walking around its public places. Visitors don't like to step over empty tea boxes as they walk down the street. They don't like it when they buy something and the shop clerk doesn't say thank you or even give them a smile. They also don't like it when someone lets a door slam  into them instead of holding it open. Shanghai is a nice city but it is not always the most polite city. I don't think this is intentional . I think it's just a lack of awareness . China is becoming a popular place for tourists to visit. When they come to Shanghai they will find a friendly city: it would be nice if they also found a polite one. And, remember, being polite makes you feel good, too. It's nice to be nice.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the man that resupplied the depot that was reached on February 23rd by the group that aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days?, using the article: The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \\"Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\\". Wild's laconic comment was \\"Good old Joyce\\".Their food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to the question is Ernest Joyce. He was the man who resupplied the depot at Bluff Depot, which was reached on February 23rd by the group that aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can't say I was necessarily disappointed since I was still mildly entertained. To sum it up 3 tough as nails criminals (haha) and an undercover cop go into the jungle to find diamonds. They come across some guy and his girl, kidnap them and their boat. Then lots of nothing happens but they still film it anyways.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… How does the actress feel about the playwright?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Occasional rewards will sweeten the tasks and help keep you on track. If you manage to do something that you didn't the day before or that you were absolutely dreading, you deserve a nice treat. By rewarding yourself after completion of small milestones along the way to the big one, you build in automatic reinforcement that you're doing the right thing. Keep most rewards simple but effective, such as extended breaks, catching a movie, splurging on a calorie-laden snack (once in a while!) or similar things. Leave really large rewards for the overall achievement or endpoint. By using self-rewards, you'll train your mind to actively seek working before the reward.  Breaks are rewards and necessities. Don't confuse the need to take regular short breaks to restore creativity and freshness with laziness. Clearly, the flip side to rewards is punishment. People respond best to positive reinforcement and it's best to stick to the rewards. Punishing yourself for not achieving things will simply backfire, confirming your worst-held beliefs about yourself that you're lazy and good-for-nothing. That's a pointless exercise if ever there was one. A list of weekly goals will help you stay focused and motivated. As you go, it's inevitable that your goals will change. You'll also pinpoint the ways that are most effective for achieving them. As they morph, so should your list. Post the list everywhere and anywhere. Try making it your lock screen on your device or phone. To do this, simply write them in your notes, take a screenshot and make it your background. Create daily goals, monthly goals, and even yearly goals to keep looking at every day differently. To enjoy any benefit, there is usually a cost to be suffered. The pain/suffering cost is usually emotional, often physical and sometimes psychic. Often that pain involves a feeling of being left out or going without while others don't seem to be putting up with the same challenges (usually they have their own challenges which you don't see though). And that pain can cause you to avoid, distract and seek safety in a comfort zone. To push past your comfort zone, you'll need to face the pain before you can reach the possibilities. Assess whether a potential benefit is worth the cost to you. If it is  worth it (and most times, it will be), draw on your ever-evolving maturity to generate the required courage, endurance and discipline that will give you the strength to achieve brilliant outcomes. Nobody achieves anything without effort and pain. Most experts, professionals and geniuses will readily admit that most of their achievements are 99 percent sweat and one percent talent. Undisciplined talent gets few people anywhere –– excellence in academics, financial autonomy, sports, the performing arts and relationships demands steady and consistent thoughtfulness and work that strains even the best of us emotionally and physically. Your will to survive and flourish needs to translate to your will to work and suffer when to do so is both necessary and useful. You won't be a great businessman, a great runner, a great cook, or even great at your job overnight. You'll fail and fail and fail and fail. This is normal. This is good. This means you're still going. Having too many activities or distractions in your daily life can make it easy to avoid the things you need to do. Try to declutter your schedule by delegating important tasks and removing non-necessary ones. Turn off distractions, and focus on your goals. For example, if you are trying to write 1,000 words every weekend but find you keep falling short because of your extracurricular activities, consider getting rid of one of them. By cutting out even one one-hour meeting a week, you'll have more time to reach your goal. There will be times when it gets harder and post-reward you can sometimes feel a bit flat about returning to the task at hand. In such times, you'll need to draw on inner reserves to remind yourself of the goal or solution sought to stay focused. Make the most of feeling that you're on a roll –– when you're in that state (often termed \\"the flow state\\"), use it to leap to another task or goal as soon as you're done rewarding yourself.  The longer that you delay restarting after finishing one element in your tasks or goals, the harder it becomes to restart. Remember the feelings of being deeply involved in getting things done, and how good it feels to achieve things. And the sooner you restart, the more confident you'll feel and the sooner these good feelings will be restored. Consider asking someone to be your accountability partner. If, for example, you have a goal of going to the gym every day, ask a friend to hold you accountable. Text them every day after you go. If you don't go, have them text you to remind you of your goal. It's one thing to find your motivation. But it's quite something else to keep it going when the going gets tough, especially in the face of unforeseen problems. Realize that interruptions happen, often for no reason, and they'll upend your efforts. Rather than letting setbacks demotivate you, see them for what they are and refuse to be flattened by them. You're not alone and staying focused on working through challenges is one of the best ways of coping and bouncing back. Remind yourself how much you want to achieve your goal or task, seek help where needed, take stock of what you have already achieved and then refuse to give up. You got this. Summary:","output":"Occasional rewards can help you stay on track and motivated while working towards your goals. Make sure to take breaks and don't punish yourself for any setbacks, as positivity is more effective for personal growth. Adjust your goals as necessary and maintain weekly, monthly, and yearly goals for continued focus. Embrace the effort and pain required to achieve your desired outcomes and learn from your failures. Declutter your schedule to minimize distractions and delegate tasks if possible. Draw on your inner reserves during challenging times and consider finding an accountability partner to help you stay on track. Be persistent in the face of setbacks and interruptions, viewing them as opportunities for growth rather than reasons to give up. With determination and focus, you can maintain motivation and achieve your goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Two polls released Wednesday in the showdown state of Florida suggest that it might, unless Newt Gingrich can re-energize his populist, anti-establishment coalition before next Tuesday's vote.From mid-December, when Romney launched his first offensive against Gingrich, through the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, divide and conquer was the decisive dynamic in the GOP race. Romney moved into the lead during that period because he consolidated the center of the party behind him more than any one of his rivals consolidated the right of the party against him. Instead, conservatives fragmented among a long menu of choices.That pattern flipped in Gingrich's crushing South Carolina victory last Saturday. Gingrich ran better among the key elements of what could be called the GOP's populist wing-including evangelical Christians, strong tea party supporters, non-college voters, those earning less than 50,000 annually and voters who identify as very conservative-than Romney did among the opposite groups in the GOP's managerial wing (non-evangelicals, non-Tea Party supporters, moderates, and more affluent and college-educated voters.) In South Carolina, Gingrich actually won some of those more centrist and pragmatic groups. Even when he didn't, he held down Romney's margin among those groups-while running up his own advantage among their conservative mirror images.The CNN/Time/ORC Florida survey released this afternoon looks less like South Carolina than it does like Iowa.

Monthly Archives      Categories      Recent Posts ||||| Polling released within the past 24 hours suggests that Mitt Romney has stopped and possibly reversed Newt Gingrich’s momentum before the Florida primary on Tuesday.      The FiveThirtyEight forecast model still projects Mr. Gingrich as the slight favorite in Florida, giving him a two-point lead and a 60 percent chance of victory. However, this lead is diminished considerably from two days ago, when the model saw a potential double-digit win for Mr. Gingrich, as polls released immediately after the South Carolina primary had him surging in Florida.      In fact, I suspect that the model is being too conservative and that there is enough evidence — when you look carefully at the day-to-day results — to conclude that Mr. Romney has re-emerged as the slight favorite in Florida instead.      The complication in Florida is that there are two conflicting trends. It should be quite obvious that Mr. Gingrich’s position is much stronger than it was before Jan. 16; after his strong performance in a debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., that night, s support began rising sharply in state and national polls.      However, it looks as though Mr. Gingrich’s surge may have reached its apogee over the weekend — timed perfectly for his big win in South Carolina, but not necessarily for one in Florida next week.            The chart below probably does the clearest job of telling the story. It shows the results of all recent Florida polls based on the dates the poll takers were in the field. Often, this includes more detail on the day-by-day breakdowns than is available from the poll’s top-line results, based either on additional information published in the pollster’s cross-tabulations or detail that the polling firm made available to FiveThirtyEight.      In the chart, you see Mr. Gingrich gaining on Mr. Romney over the course of last week — and then surging ahead after his win in South Carolina. However, since the weekend, Mr. Gingrich appears to have lost ground on Mr. Romney with each passing day.      Visually, it seems quite obvious what is going on, and there is a lot to be said for that. Pattern recognition is one of those things that our brains tend to be pretty good at — better, usually, than computer algorithms.      On the other hand, there is some information that this chart disguises that something like the FiveThirtyEight forecast model picks up on.      For instance, the CNN poll released on Wednesday showed Mr. Gingrich performing much worse in the interviews it conducted on Monday and Tuesday — when he trailed Mr. Romney by nine points — than in the ones it conducted on Sunday, the day after his South Carolina win, when Mr. Gingrich led Mr. Romney by six points instead. However, the sizes of these subsamples are tiny — CNN interviewed 369 voters in total, and dividing them up in this way yields margins of sampling error in the range of about 7.5 percentage points. In contrast, some of the polls released on Sunday and Monday had considerably larger sample sizes.      Another pollster to show this kind of shift — the American Research Group — has performed well this year in the first three early-voting states. But its overall track record has been quite mixed.      Because the model considers things like a firm’s track record and the sample size of a poll in addition to the field dates, it’s not quite persuaded that the short-term trend over the past 48 hours is enough to outweigh the medium-term trend toward Mr. Gingrich, for which there is less ambiguous evidence.      Meanwhile, some of the anecdotal evidence still seems quite favorable for Mr. Gingrich: he has drawn much larger crowds than Mr. Romney to his events in Florida, for instance, which could be a sign that his voters are more enthusiastic and more likely to turn out.      Still, I think the model is being too stubborn in this instance, and this is one of those times I would probably bet against its forecasts. It is not as if all of this is happening in a vacuum: there was a debate, for instance, on Monday night, and although both pundit reaction and polls of debate watchers suggested that it was more or less a draw, Mr. Romney may have done enough damage on Mr. Gingrich’s ties to Freddie Mac and his resignation as House speaker to raise fresh doubts in voters’ minds about his candidacy.      Another piece of context is that the polls have been unusually volatile all year, perhaps because of the way the news cycle is changing and speeding up.      The model uses data going as far back as 1980 to calibrate its results. Perhaps back then, it would have been appropriate to be skeptical that Mr. Gingrich could lose his momentum so quickly — especially when this evidence is based on polls with limited sample sizes or mixed track records. But we may be living in a different world now.      And yet, that volatility suggests that even if Mr. Gingrich has lost the momentum, he might easily regain it again — for instance, if he performs well at the next debate on Thursday. ||||| 7 years ago      Jacksonville, Florida (CNN) - One day before the final GOP presidential debate in Florida, it's all tied up between Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, according to a new survey.      A CNN/Time/ORC International Poll also indicates that while Gingrich surged following his 12-point victory in Saturday's South Carolina primary, his momentum appears to be quickly cooling off.      CNN LIVE: Tune in Thursday at 8 p.m. ET for the CNN/Republican Party of Florida Debate hosted by Wolf Blitzer and follow it on Twitter at #CNNDebate. For real-time coverage of the Florida primary, go to CNNPolitics.com or to the CNN apps or CNN mobile web site.      Follow the Ticker on Twitter: @politicalticker      According to the poll, 36% of people likely to vote in Tuesday's Republican primary in the Sunshine State say they are backing Romney as the party's nominee, with 34% supporting Gingrich. The former Massachusetts governor's two point margin over the former House speaker is well within the survey's sampling error.      Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania is at 11% and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas is at 9%, with 7% unsure. The poll's Wednesday release comes one day before a CNN-Republican Party of Florida presidential debate at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville. The showdown is the last time the candidates will face off on the same stage before Tuesday's winner-take-all primary, where 50 delegates are up for grabs.      \\"In the wake of his double-digit victory in the South Carolina primary, Newt Gingrich has nearly doubled his support in Florida,\\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \\"The current numbers are the result of some wild swings for and against the two frontrunners.\\"      Gingrich was at 18% support in Florida and trailed Romney by 25 points in CNN's last poll in the state, which was conducted Jan. 13-17.      The new survey was conducted Sunday through Tuesday, after the Palmetto State primary, and mostly before and partially after Monday night's Republican presidential debate in Tampa, where in a role reversal, Romney aggressively attacked Gingrich.      On Sunday, the day after Gingrich won big in South Carolina, he was at 38% in Florida, with Romney at 36%, Santorum at 11% and Paul at 8%. Looking only at Monday and Tuesday's results, Romney was at 38%, Gingrich 29% Santorum at 11% and Paul at 9%.      \\"Gingrich's post-Palmetto State bounce did not last long,\\" adds Holland. \\"Monday's debate may have something to do with that, but the data indicate that the shift to Romney began      before the debate started, so there are clearly other forces at work.\\"      The poll indicates that Gingrich has a 10-point lead over Romney among self-described conservatives and appears to do better than Romney among born-again Christians and tea party movement supporters. The geography of the state appears to back that up - Gingrich does five points better than Romney in the more conservative northern and central parts of Florida; Romney does better in Tampa Bay, Miami, and southern Florida, where moderates and northern transplants are more prevalent.      A gender gap appears to have developed as well. In South Carolina, Gingrich won among men and women, according to exit polls. But in Florida, although Gingrich has an edge among men, Romney had the advantage among women.      \\"Some of that may be due to recent coverage of Gingrich's personal life, but it is almost certainly due to other factors as well. Gingrich's favorable rating has consistently been higher among men than among women for years before he became a presidential candidate, suggesting that men may find his red-meat approach to issues more appealing than women do,\\" says Holland.      With six days to go until Florida's GOP primary, which is only open to registered Republicans, one in four questioned said they may change their minds on which candidate they are supporting, while 64% said they are definitely sticking with the candidate they are currently backing.      The CNN/Time poll was conducted by ORC International from January 22-24, with 369 likely Florida GOP primary voters questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus five percentage points.

The Luftwaffe was the air force of Nazi Germany and played a significant role during World War II. It was involved in several operations, strategies, and tactics in the war. Its primary policies and objectives can be classified into different categories based on the stage of the war and the goals of the German High Command. 1. Early War In the initial stages of World War II, the Luftwaffe primarily focused on enabling and supporting the German army's fast-paced territorial conquests with a strategy known as \\"Blitzkrieg\\" (lightning war). This involved leveraging quick surprise attacks, rapid troop movements, and air superiority to overwhelm enemy defenses. 2. Battle of Britain The second primary policy of the Luftwaffe became more evident during the Battle of Britain (1940), which aimed at achieving air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF) and enabling an invasion of Britain by land or sea (Operation Sea Lion). Although the battle evolved into a strategic bombing campaign targeting Britain's air defenses, industrial centers, and civilian population, the overall goal remained the same: to force Britain into submission or negotiate a peace settlement on Germany's terms. In this context, the statement \\"It also took part in the bombing over Britain\\" accurately describes an important aspect of the Luftwaffe's second primary policy, which was the strategic bombing campaign and targeting of British infrastructure. However, it does not capture the broader objective of achieving air superiority over the RAF and facilitating invasion plans. A more comprehensive answer to \\"What was the Luftwaffe's second primary policy?\\" would be: The Luftwaffe's second primary policy was to achieve air superiority over the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain in order to enable a possible invasion of Britain (Operation Sea Lion) or force Britain into submission through strategic bombing targeting air defenses, industrial centers, and civilian population."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In an interview for HitQuarters, Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his Achilles tendon and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer Ray LaMontagne was the primary inspiration for \\"Halo\\". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \\"Shelter\\" for Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z, and proposed the title \\"Halo\\" after hearing Tedder play \\"angelic\\" chords. They wrote the song in three hours.According to Simon Cowell, owner of the music production company Syco Entertainment, Bogart and Tedder intended \\"Halo\\" for his client, singer Leona Lewis, who could not record the song because of her tight schedule.

Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Relatives of a woman killed in a Spanish airline crash were erroneously given the remains of another victim, and then were asked by authorities to return them, CNN partner network CNN+ reported Thursday. The victims of the crash were first laid out at a Madria convention center. A Madrid judge has opened an investigation into the error, and judicial sources say the initial indication is that the mixup occurred not in the proper identification of the victim, but in delivering the wrong remains to the family in question, CNN+ reported. The family Wednesday received an urn numbered 104, and were told it contained the ashes of their loved one, Pilar Gonzalez Ferreira, who died in the crash. But as the family was preparing to leave Madrid, officials called to tell them about the error and asked for the return of urn 104, CNN+ reported. Instead of urn 104, the family was supposed to have received urn 134, which actually contains the remains of Pilar Gonzalez, CNN+ reported, citing judicial sources and another family which also lost a relative in the crash. The Spanair MD82 jet crashed last week at Madrid's airport as the plane was trying to take off, killing 154 people. The aircraft, bound for Spain's Canary Islands, managed to rise only slightly before coming down quickly to the right of the runway, its tail section hitting the ground first, just off the asphalt. Then the out-of-control plane skidded and bounced at least three times as it careered 1,200 meters (3,840 feet) across uneven terrain and exploded, coming to rest in a gully, a top official of the investigative commission told a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday.

Movie title: Dead Snow Movie plot: The movie opens with a woman (Ane Dahl Torp) being chased through the snows of Norway. She is finally cornered and eaten by zombies in World War II German uniforms.The movie then moves to seven medical students on Easter vacation. They arrive at a small cabin near Øksfjord, about a 45-minute walk from the road where they have left their cars. The cabin is owned by Sara, another student who is the girlfriend of Vegard (Lasse Valdal), the student in the main group with the most knowledge of the wilderness. She has been skiing across the mountains to meet them, but has not yet arrived.They drink and party until a mysterious hiker (Bjørn Sundquist) arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppen led by the dreaded Standartenführer Herzog occupied the area. During three long years the Nazis abused and tortured the local people, and near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, looted all their valuables before starting to withdraw from the area. The citizens managed to stage an uprising and ambushed the Nazis, killing many. The surviving Nazis, including Herzog, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker says the area still has an evil reputation. He leaves to continue on his way. Later the hiker is murdered by zombies while camped in the snow.The next morning Sara has still not arrived and Vegard takes the group's snowmobile to look for her. He finds the body of the hiker in his tent, but then falls through snow into a cave below.The other students find an old wooden box filled with valuables and German decorations hidden under the floor. They consider taking and selling it, but eventually put it back, although some of them keep items. After it gets dark, one of the students, Chris (Jenny Skavlan), goes to the outhouse, but is murdered while on the toilet. The others go outside to look for her; they do not find her, but do find Sara's rucksack buried in the snow.A little later, Chris's severed head... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Dead Snow\\", Vegard is bitten by the zombie when he falls through the snow into a cave while searching for his girlfriend, Sara. After discovering the hiker's body, Vegard accidentally falls into the cave, where he encounters the undead Nazis. It is during this encounter that he gets bitten by one of the zombies, which leads to further consequences in the plot of the film. \\"Dead Snow\\" is a horror-comedy film that brings a unique mix of humor, gore, and suspense together. The zombie theme, combined with the historical aspect of World War II Nazis, adds another layer of intrigue and horror to the story. The movie utilizes the remote, snowy Norwegian landscape to create a chilling and atmospheric setting, which adds to the overall tension and eeriness of the film. Investing in a film proposal can be a risky business, and it usually depends on various factors, such as the target audience, genre, marketability, and potential return on investment. When it comes to investing in \\"Dead Snow\\", there are a few points to consider: 1. Target audience: \\"Dead Snow\\" is aimed primarily at horror and comedy enthusiasts who enjoy zombie movies. While not a mainstream film, it has its niche and a dedicated fan base that could make it a profitable venture. 2. Genre: As a horror-comedy film, \\"Dead Snow\\" offers a unique combination of elements that allow it to appeal to fans of both genres. Horror movies, in general, tend to have a faithful audience that is always eager for new content. The addition of comedy broadens the film's appeal, providing a lighter and more entertaining experience for viewers. 3. Marketability: The snowy Norwegian landscape, the undead Nazi zombies, and the infusion of comedy into the horror genre can make \\"Dead Snow\\" a marketable film. It has strong visual elements, a unique premise, and a darkly comic twist that differentiates it from other zombie movies. 4. Potential Return on Investment: \\"Dead Snow\\" was initially released in 2009 and gained a cult following. Due to its positive reception, a sequel called \\"Dead Snow: Red vs. Dead\\" was released in 2014, which further expanded the film's universe and fan base. The sequel's existence suggests the film has potential for profitability and continued interest from the audience. Taking all these points into consideration, it's crucial to evaluate the potential risks and rewards associated with investing in this film proposal. While \\"Dead Snow\\" has its niche market and loyal fan base, it may not have the same mass appeal as other mainstream films. However, if the proposal's budget, marketing strategy, and distribution plan align with your investment goals and risk tolerance, it could be worth considering."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story. This picture is at it's best when Strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood.

Minnesota QB Teddy Bridgewater was unable to complete a single pass on the next drive, forcing Blair Walsh to attempt a 44-yard field goal; however, he pushed it wide right. After forcing the 49ers to punt on the next series, the Vikings were themselves forced to punt immediately afterwards, only for the 49ers' rookie former rugby league star Jarryd Hayne to muff the catch, allowing the Vikings to recover the ball. The next drive saw the Vikings attempt to convert on 4th-and-3, but Bridgewater's completed pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph fell a yard short of a fresh set of downs. Both sides exchanged punts at the start of the second quarter, with the 49ers eventually returning one 85 yards for a touchdown, only for it to be called back for an illegal block by a San Francisco player. However, the ensuing possession would end with a 49ers touchdown, as they drove 93 yards in just under 5 minutes, before Carlos Hyde finished the series with a 10-yard touchdown run; after finding nowhere to go on his initial run to the right, he beat a Minnesota defender with a spin move and ran back to the left side of the field, where quarterback Colin Kaepernick led him into the end zone. With the Vikings unable to score in the remaining 47 seconds, the first half ended 7-0 to San Francisco. Minnesota started the third quarter with the ball, but they were unable to make it out of their half before being forced to punt. The 49ers then extended their lead on the ensuing possession, driving 73 yards to the Minnesota 11-yard line to set up a 30-yard field goal attempt for Dawson. The Vikings finally got on the scoreboard early in the fourth quarter, as Walsh finished off a 66-yard drive with a 37-yard field goal, but the 49ers pulled further ahead with a second touchdown for Hyde on a 17-yard run. Bridgewater attempted to spark the Vikings back into the game, but a deep pass intended for Rudolph was intercepted by Tramaine Brock, setting up a 25-yard field goal for Dawson. The next drive saw the Vikings go for it again on 4th-and-8, but Bridgewater was sacked for a loss of 14 yards, allowing the 49ers to kneel out the game. Which players attempted a field goal over 28 yards?","output":"In this text, two players attempted a field goal over 28 yards: 1. Blair Walsh attempted a 44-yard field goal for the Minnesota Vikings. 2. Phil Dawson attempted a 30-yard field goal for the San Francisco 49ers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I recently decided to revisit The Omen trilogy only to discover that {insert demonic music here} there is a fourth. I didn't expect much from it, and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations. If you're into watching bad movies for a laugh, then this just may be the movie for you. Oh, where do we start? From the onset, the \\"made for TV\\" look and feel of the movie was obvious. The music was often inappropriately matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore (at best) distracting. The script had all the suspense of an 8 year-olds work of fiction. But one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting. Numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of ridiculousness. The story itself is quite thin, centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of Damien Thorn, adopted out by wrong-doing and badly acted nuns. There is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the \\"drama\\" unfolded, and the usual third-party investigator into the whole affair. Later, via some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn Jnr is born. And that pretty much wraps up the plot. The whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous and/or ridiculous scene after another.  There were many WTF?!? moments too that provides the unintended comedy relief. For example, what's with the major over-reaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mother's cheek?? Hardly a 360-degree-head-turning omen. I also laughed at the over-reaction at the baptism. The baby cries, and everyone looks very concerned. The distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very alarmed while crossing himself. Huh? Then there is the new-age nanny that seems to have carte blanche on exposing an 8 year-old to all kind of alternative spiritualism. I laughed when the nanny suggested bringing the troubled Delia to a psychic fair to meet the nanny's hippie friends and the mother just shrugs her shoulders and allows it. \\"Yeah that's groovy, fill my troubled 8 year old daughter's head with all this mysticism stuff. That's cool. I don't need to be there.\\" Of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown Rottweiler they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a snack. The entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way, from the horrified reactionary stares of the psychics to Delia, to the ensuing inferno. I also laughed at how the nun's death is considered a \\"freak accident\\". Here we have a religious zealot, (who is described as being part of a cult), who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how God's Glory will protect them. She antagonizes the snakes by handling them and SOMEHOW she is bitten several times. Hardly a freak accident. More like a successful suicide attempt.  The snakes-vs-nun scene wasn't the only comical death. There is the slow-speed car accident resulting in decapitation in a school parking lot. Then there is the slow-motion demolition ball headed straight for the detective. I believe I may have gone and made a coffee when the slow-motion started only to come back to see the demolition ball still headed straight for the \\"concerned\\" detective. Then there is the quintessential who-shot-who cliché death, where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified glances. Then someone goes tumbling down the stairs revealing who the real victim was. Additionally, the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me. He runs around looking at the architecture of the church. Obviously finding this quite distressing, he eventually collapses, clutching his chest and dies. Apparently something demonic was happening, as this is what the music was suggesting. Ummm. OK.  I am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and, in particularly, as a \\"worthy sequel\\". It is difficult not to notice the non-sensical script, the unrealistic acting, and the inappropriate musical score. The movie lacks any suspense, relying heavily on Delia's \\"demonic stare\\" to provide a sense of horror, which becomes rather annoying after a short time.  Bottom line : This is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being it's unintended potential for being a comedy.","output":"The sentiment of this review is largely negative. The reviewer points out numerous criticisms and flaws with the movie, such as a poorly written script, lack of suspense, bad acting, and issues with the music score. They also highlight multiple scenes they found unintentionally comical. However, the reviewer does mention that if you enjoy watching bad movies for the sake of comedy, it may still be enjoyable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Make this lower case","output":"a collection of posthumous, unfinished manuscripts by martinus from the 1970s until his death in 1981 when he was preparing the first publication of his works under the common title the third testament. In this collection of posthumous, unfinished manuscripts, the reader can find a treasure trove of wisdom and insights by the renowned Danish spiritual author and philosopher, Martinus Thomsen, more commonly known as Martinus. Spanning over a decade from the 1970s until his death in 1981, these manuscripts showcase the series of works that Martinus had envisioned and planned to publish as a unified body of knowledge under the title, The Third Testament. The Third Testament was meant to stand as a monumental work that would build upon the ideas and teachings of the Old and New Testaments, adding a modern understanding of spirituality and cosmology to the mix. Martinus, who was deeply inspired by the spiritual awakening he experienced in 1921, used his intuitive and extraordinary insight to probe into the mysteries of life and uncover the principles driving the evolution of the universe and consciousness. In his writing, Martinus tackled various themes such as love, morality, death, karma, and the purpose of human existence. A writer par excellence, he was well-known for his ability to explain complex and abstract concepts in a language that was accessible and easy to understand for the lay reader. His vision of a world united by spiritual understanding, transcending barriers of religion, race, and nationality, has inspired countless individuals seeking to connect with their inner selves and the divine power that pervades all creation. The manuscripts in this collection offer a unique opportunity to explore Martinus' groundbreaking thoughts and ideas that were yet to be fully actualized at the time of his death in 1981. As these works were not completed, they may not exhibit the same level of refinement or organization as his published works. However, their raw and unvarnished nature lends them an authenticity and depth that reveal Martinus' innermost thought processes, intellectual struggles, and spiritual breakthroughs in a manner that may not be evident in his polished final works. For individuals already familiar with the works of Martinus, these manuscripts can be seen as complementary to his other well-known publications, including \\"Livets Bog\\" (The Book of Life), \\"Bisættelse\\" (Funeral Rites), and \\"Menneskehedens Skæbne\\" (The Fate of Mankind). By delving into these unpublished manuscripts, readers can enhance their understanding of Martinus' teachings and further appreciate the profound wisdom that he sought to impart through his life's work. In conclusion, this trove of posthumous, unfinished manuscripts by Martinus from the 1970s until his death in 1981 offers a remarkable glimpse into the mind of a deeply spiritual individual and philosopher who had devoted his life to unraveling the mysteries of existence. By exploring these works and seeking to understand the ideas presented within them, readers may find new pathways to spiritual understanding, personal growth, and ultimately, the divine essence within themselves and the universe at large."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: shelf, toy store, shelter, house, den  Why is \\"house\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"House\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a place where people generally feel comfortable, safe, and relaxed, making it a suitable environment for playing board games.  Houses typically provide enough space to set up board games, with areas such as living rooms, dining rooms, or even bedrooms being utilized for such recreational activities, depending on the personal preferences of the inhabitants. Furthermore, playing board games at home often allows for easy access to the game components and enables family members or friends to gather and engage in the activity. The home setting is also conducive to impromptu gaming sessions, as there is no need to transport game materials or reserve a location beforehand. In contrast, the other options listed as possible answers may not be relevant or practical for playing board games. A shelf is simply a place to store items, a toy store is a retail business for purchasing games, and a shelter usually implies a temporary living space where one might not have the luxury of playing games. The term \\"den\\" could potentially refer to a room in a house designated for recreation, which would also be suitable for playing board games; however, not all houses have a specific \\"den\\" space.

Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.)

Movie title: Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Context: The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice. A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers, in a parody of Jaws). While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Navy diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter. Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could \\"pass the ketchup.\\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the president sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency \\"Mind Makers,\\" where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys including a bumper sticker with \\"STP\\" for \\"Stop Tomato Program\\" on it, a satirical reference to both the real \\"whip inflation now\\" campaign with its widely ridiculed \\"WIN\\" slogan and STP motor oil decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s.

As per the given context, Kafe Hærverk is identified as an experimental music venue and is mentioned as \\"next door\\" to Hausmania.

If you do not have beef broth, you could use venison stock, beef stock, chicken stock, or vegetable broth. In a pinch, you could even use water. Cut the butter into small chunks and distribute it evenly over the surface of the roast. If the butter has been softened, smear it over the top and sides of the meat. If the butter is still hard, however, simply distribute the chunks of butter over the surface as evenly as possible to distribute the flavor. Combine the garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, and rosemary in a small bowl. Sprinkle this blend of spices and herbs evenly over the top and sides of the roast. If you want the seasonings to penetrate the meat even further, consider using your hands to rub the seasoning blend into the meat. This works best if you are also using softened butter since you can spread both the butter and the seasonings over the surface at the same time. Spread the diced onion over the top of the roast. Layer the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots on top, as well.  Even if you choose not to prepare the roast with vegetables, you should still add the onion. Many people claim that the pungent onion flavor masks the \\"gamey\\" taste of a deer roast. If you prefer crisp, firm vegetables, you can wait until the final 2 hours of cooking time before adding the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots. The onion should always be added at this time, however. Cover the slow cooker and switch it to low.
