Here is a hypothesis: It was a horrible incident. Here are the options: Options are: (i). yes. (ii). it is not possible to tell. (iii). no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To analyze whether it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true, we need to look at the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis and examine any logical connections. Premise: \\"There are some times where a man does something unforgivable.\\" This statement acknowledges that there are situations where a person commits an act that cannot be forgiven. It does not specify the nature, severity, or frequency of such acts but rather establishes that these acts exist. Hypothesis: \\"It was a horrible incident.\\" The hypothesis makes a claim about a specific incident, stating that it was horrible. This statement is qualitative, and it provides a value judgment of a particular event. It does not necessarily refer to an unforgivable act, but a horrible incident can be associated with unforgivable acts. Now, we examine the possible connections between the premise and hypothesis: (i) Yes The hypothesis could be true if the premise is true. If there are times when a man does something unforgivable, then it is likely that there exist horrible incidents that are linked to those unforgivable acts. It would not be a stretch to assume that an unforgivable act would also be considered a \\"horrible incident.\\" In this sense, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis can be true as well. (ii) It is not possible to tell While the premise and the hypothesis have some loose connection, the relationship between them is not absolute or definitive. The premise does not guarantee that every horrible incident refers to an unforgivable act since many horrible incidents can occur that are not necessarily unforgivable. Similarly, the hypothesis does not conclusively determine whether a horrible incident is the result of an unforgivable act by a man. Several factors and contexts come into play when assessing the connection between the premise and hypothesis. (iii) No Although it seems less likely for this option to be viable, it is theoretically possible that if the premise is true, the hypothesis could still be false. The premise acknowledges the existence of unforgivable acts, but it does not automatically mean that every horrible incident is a result of such an act. Multiple horrible incidents may occur without being connected to an unforgivable act. Considering these possible connections, the most accurate answer should reflect that it is not possible to tell (option (ii)) because the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is not definite or exclusive. If the premise is true, it does not, by default, make the hypothesis true. There should be more information or investigation of specific incidents to determine the validity of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As a tornado touches down yards away, right as their daughter arrives home from school, Bob warns a family about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their cellar just before it destroys their farm. Meanwhile, in (the fictional town of) Blainsworth, Nebraska (the book is set in the real-world city of Grand Island),[1][2] teenager Dan Hatch, an aspiring and practicing artist who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather Jack to be an athlete, participates in a bike race and damages his bicycle; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers. Much to his luck, he wins a new bike in a raffle held by a local bank. While trying out his new bicycle, Danny and his best friend Arthur Darlington run into Arthur's two sisters, Stacey (whom Danny is infatuated with) and Ronnie Vae, while at the park. Danny and Arthur arrive home as the former's mother Laura is preparing dinner, when she also asks Danny to tend to his baby half-brother, Ryan. Later, Laura's sister, Jenny, calls to inform her that they have been assigned to a fill-in shift as waitresses at the Salty Dawg, the local diner where they both work. On the road, while continuing to track the massive storm creeping toward the town, Bob decides to head southeast into Blainsworth, as the meteorologist he is radioing to is astonished at the uncharacteristic spring-like nature of the storm system for the fall; while there, he meets Laura and Jenny while getting some coffee at the diner. The action begins after Jack comes home at mid-evening; as he sits down to watch television, the show he is watching is interrupted by a severe weather bulletin reporting about a tornado sighting near Dannebrog, 14 miles (23Â km) northwest of Blainsworth.

As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

In each sentence, \\"stress\\" has a distinct meaning which corresponds to different concepts. 1. In the first sentence, \\"Some people put the stress on the first syllable of 'controversy'; others put it on the second,\\" the term \\"stress\\" refers to the emphasis or accent placed on a particular syllable in a word when it is pronounced. In the context of linguistics and phonetics, stress is the relative prominence given to certain syllables, often resulting from the combination of higher pitch, loudness, or length in comparison to other syllables within the same word. In this example, the sentence is discussing the variation in pronunciation of the word \\"controversy,\\" with some pronouncing it with greater emphasis on the first syllable and others emphasizing the second syllable. 2. In the second sentence, \\"Go easy on him, he's been under a lot of stress lately,\\" \\"stress\\" refers to the psychological, emotional, or physical strain or tension resulting from demanding circumstances, difficult situations or a feeling of being overwhelmed. In this context, the word \\"stress\\" is related to one's mental well-being and overall emotional state. The sentence implies that the individual in question has been dealing with a high level of stress and, as a result, the speaker is suggesting that others be more understanding or lenient towards that person. In summary, these two usages of the word \\"stress\\" are distinct and pertain to different aspects: the first refers to the emphasis placed on syllables during pronunciation, while the second is associated with the emotional strain experienced in life.

Question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the types of whales that use throat pleats to expand the mouth?, using the article: Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago.  Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of \\"smell\\", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that..., what would be the answer ?

The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive. With the little energy she has left, Eva escapes. Adrian heads to Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua, on the U.S.âMexico border to investigate the murders, hoping that if she does well she will be promoted by Morgan to be a foreign correspondent. In JuÃ¡rez, Adrian meets up with Diaz (Antonio Banderas), whom she had been working with six years before, and who is now the editor for the local newspaper \\"El Sol de JuÃ¡rez\\". She also meets Eva. The three try to find the two killers and have them prosecuted. For this purpose she starts working in the factory, in order to act as bait on the bus ride. The driver tries to assault her in the same way he did Eva, and although police assistance has been arranged, they are at the wrong place. She manages to escape her attacker. Later Diaz gets shot and killed in a drive-by shooting. Eva changes her mind and does not want to testify any more for fear of revenge, and tries to flee to the U.S., together with...

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: When did the Artizans Company finally recover from the mismanagement and fraud of Queen's Park?  The Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company (Artizans Company) was established in 1867 by William Austin. Austin was an illiterate who had begun his working life on a farm as a scarecrow paid 1 penny per day, and had worked his way up to become a drainage contractor. The company was established as a for-profit joint stock company, with the objective of building new houses for the working classes \\"in consequence of the destruction of houses by railroads and other improvements\\". The company aimed to fuse the designs of rural planned suburbs such as Bedford Park with the ethos of high-quality homes for the lower classes pioneered at Saltaire. Whilst earlier philanthropic housing companies such as the Peabody Trust and the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company focused on multi-storey blocks of flats in the inner cities, the Artizans Company aimed to build low-rise housing in open countryside alongside existing railway lines to allow workers to live in the countryside and commute into the city. The company attracted the attention of Lord Shaftesbury, who served as president until 1875. The company built and immediately sold a group of houses in Battersea, then still a rural village. The proceeds of the sale were used to purchase a plot of land in Salford for development, and by 1874 the company had developments in Liverpool, Birmingham, Gosport and Leeds.The first of the four large-scale estates built by the Artizans Company was Shaftesbury Park, a development of 1,200 two-storey houses covering 42.5 acres (0.17 km2; 0.07 sq mi) built in 1872 on the site of a former pig farm in Battersea. The success of Shaftesbury Park led to the construction of Queen's Park, built in 1874 on a far more ambitious scale on 76 acres (0.31 km2; 0.12 sq mi) of land to the west of London, adjacent to the newly opened Westbourne Park station, purchased from All Souls College, Oxford. A third London estate was planned at Cann Hall, and a site of 61 acres (0.25 km2; 0.10 sq mi) was purchased.However, the Queen's Park project... Answer:","output":"The Artizans Company finally recovered from the mismanagement and fraud of Queen's Park in the late 1880s. The Queen's Park project, which began in 1874, was more ambitious than previous projects but it encountered various challenges, such as mismanagement, financial loss, and fraud, causing a significant negative impact on the company. The development failed to meet its financial goals, resulting in the company having to liquidate several of its assets. This consequently led to a period of instability and uncertainty. However, the Artizans Company managed to recover in the late 1880s, thanks to several strategic moves and changes in the company's leadership. During this period, the company refocused its efforts on new and more successful projects, adopted better financial management, and embraced a fresh strategic direction that enabled it to minimize risks and maximize profitability. The company's ability to adapt and overcome the setbacks faced during the Queen's Park project allowed it to regain its footing and continue its mission of providing affordable, high-quality housing for the working class."},{"instruction":"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Beforehand, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to Bey. Meanwhile, in Mapleton, Massachusetts, Professor Matthew Norman, who had examined one of Kharis' missing bandage pieces during the Mummy's last spree through Mapleton, also explains the legends of the Priests of Arkam and Kharis to his History class who are less than believing. After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey, meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori, a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. However, a strange, clouded feeling in her mind occurs when ever the subject of Egypt is mentioned. Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousefâs mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey pledges his devotion before Andoheb explains that during each full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from nine tana leaves. Kharis will sense this and find the leaves wherever they are. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on a case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing nine tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that. The battered, ragged form of Kharis the Mummy, however, senses the leaves brewing and heads toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and she follows him in a trance-like state.

During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies.

Summarize this article: Mr Duncan Smith, who quit days after the 2016 Budget, is urging the PM to postpone a plan to raise the income tax threshold to fund the move. In 2015, cuts to the Universal Credit \\"work allowance\\" were announced - reducing the amount people could earn before benefit payments were withdrawn. A government spokesperson said there were \\"no plans\\" to reverse the cuts. Universal Credit's single payment replaces six current benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Mr Duncan Smith drove its introduction under the coalition government, although it was beset by delays, IT problems and an entire \\"reset\\" of the system, and was the subject of tensions between the Treasury and the DWP. He argues the cuts to work allowance cost people up to Â£1,000 as they move off benefits into work. Now a backbencher, he chairs the Centre for Social Justice which is making the call to reverse the cuts made by former chancellor George Osborne - who was sacked by Mrs May when she became prime minister in July. The CSJ is pointing to Mrs May's own words in her first speech as PM, in which she promised those who were \\"just managing\\" that \\"when it comes to taxes, we'll prioritise not the wealthy, but you\\". Mr Duncan Smith argued that higher earners would benefit most from raising the income tax threshold - something the government has pledged to do by 2020 - and said the money should be spent on those who were \\"just about managing\\" instead. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the former minister said: \\"One of the key elements as you cross into work, the work allowances, those were all reduced. The problem with that is it means it is more difficult to get people into work and keep them in work. \\"We want to get people into work, we want them to progress through work, but most importantly, we want to make sure work always pays.\\" He said raising the tax threshold for everyone would mean about 25p in every pound would end up with the lowest paid, while reversing the Universal Credit cuts was \\"a more direct way of delivering on Theresa May's statement, which was strong and powerful, to help those who try\\". The CSJ argues that Â£3.4bn cut from the Universal Credit budget by Mr Osborne would cost people up to Â£1,000 as they \\"transitioned\\" from Universal Credit into work, thereby undermining incentives to take a job and move off benefits. The government says Universal Credit work allowances have been simplified and people are getting extra help to move into work, as well as benefitting from increased tax allowances, childcare support and the National Living Wage. A spokesman for the DWP said: \\"There are no plans to revisit the work allowance changes announced in the budget last year. \\"Universal Credit is transforming lives with claimants moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system.\\" Mr Duncan Smith also defended his work at the DWP, following the new film by Ken Loach, 'I, Daniel Blake', which tells the story of a joiner in north east England on benefits. Mr Loach appeared on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, criticising the system that tells \\"the most vulnerable people\\" that their poverty \\"is their own fault.\\" Mr Duncan Smith said he had \\"high regard\\" for Mr Loach but added: \\"Whilst on the one level this was a human story, full of pathos and difficulties, I think is the film has taken the very worst of anything that can ever happen to anybody and said 'this is life how it is lived'. I don't believe that \\"Also, his portrayal of job centre staff was unfair. Yes, you will always get one of two, but the vast, vast, vast majority are there to work and help people. This idea that everybody is out to crunch you has really hurt a lot of job centre staff.\\"","output":"Former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is demanding that UK Prime Minister Theresa May reverses cuts made to Universal Credit, a single-payment welfare system that began implementation under then-Prime Minister David Cameron. Introduced in order to encourage people to move from benefits back into work, the system sees six benefits disbursed in a single payment, including Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance. Duncan Smith also argues that the cuts to work allowance cost people up to £1,000 as they attempt to move off benefits into work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series .","output":"The sentiment expressed in the given movie review sentence appears to be negative. To provide a detailed understanding of the negativity in the sentence, let's break down and analyze the key phrases and their impact on the overall sentiment. 1. \\"Generates little narrative momentum\\" - This phrase suggests that the film fails to build a strong, compelling story that keeps the audience engaged. By using the word \\"little,\\" the reviewer implies that the movie lacks a solid narrative structure, which is essential in creating an interesting and gripping cinematic experience. This phrase contributes to the negative sentiment of the statement. 2. \\"Invites unflattering comparisons\\" - The use of \\"unflattering comparisons\\" indicates that the movie doesn't stand up well when compared to others within its genre or context (in this case, other installments in the Ryan series). \\"Unflattering\\" can be understood as an undesirable or unfavorable attribute, hence contributing to the overall negative sentiment. 3. \\"Other installments in the Ryan series\\" - This phrase is crucial in the context of the review because it reveals that the movie is part of a series, and comparisons to previous or later installments are likely to be more meaningful and relevant for potential viewers. By stating that the film invites unfavorable comparisons to these other movies, the reviewer communicates that this particular installment might be weaker or less enjoyable than the others, which again, adds to the negative sentiment expressed in the statement. In conclusion, the sentiment of the given movie review sentence is negative as it highlights the film's shortcomings in terms of narrative momentum and its unfavorable standing when compared to other installments in the series.

The song's use of Indian and free-form jazz influences, along with its impressionistic lyrics, were immediately influential on the emerging genre of psychedelic rock. Accordingly, some authors and music historians, including Eric V. D. Luft, Domenic Priore, and Dwight Rounds, have described \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song. In his book Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood, Priore cites \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the record that kicked off the psychedelic craze, explaining \\"prior to 'Eight Miles High,' there were no pop records with incessant, hypnotic basslines juxtaposed by droning, trance-induced improvisational guitar.\\"  The song was responsible for the naming of the musical subgenre raga rock, when journalist Sally Kempton, in her review of the single for The Village Voice, used the term to describe the record's experimental fusion of eastern and western music. However, although Kempton was the first person to use the term raga rock in print, she had actually borrowed the phrase from the promotional material that the Byrds' press office had supplied to accompany the \\"Eight Miles High\\" single release. In a 1968 interview for the Pop Chronicles radio documentary, McGuinn denied that the song was in fact an example of raga rock, while Crosby, speaking in 1998, dismissed the term entirely, stating \\"they kept trying to label us; every time we turned around, they came up with a new one ... it's a bunch of bullshit.\\" Nonetheless, the experimental nature of the song placed the Byrds firmly at the forefront of the burgeoning psychedelic movement, along with the Yardbirds, the Beatles, Donovan and the Rolling Stones, who were all exploring similar musical territory concurrently.  Contemporary reviews for the single were mostly positive, with Billboard magazine describing the song as a \\"Big beat rhythm rocker with soft lyric ballad vocal and off-beat instrumental backing.\\" Record World magazine also praised the song, commenting \\"It's an eerie tune with lyrics bound to hypnotize. Will climb heights.\\" In the UK, Music Echo described the song as \\"wild and oriental but still beaty\\". The publication also suggested that with the release of \\"Eight Miles High\\" the Byrds had jumped ahead of the Beatles in terms of creativity, stating \\"[By] getting their single out now they've beaten the Beatles to the punch, for Paul [McCartney] admitted recently that the Liverpool foursome are working on a similar sound for their new album and single.\\" In recent years, Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, has described \\"Eight Miles High\\" as \\"one of the greatest singles of the '60s.\\"  In 1999, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an honor reserved for \\"recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old.\\" In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \\"Eight Miles High\\" at number 151 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and in March 2005, Q magazine placed the song at number 50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.

By nightfall he arrives at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and agrees to share a bed with a then absent stranger. He enjoys drinks at the inn and as he waits for night he is told of the rules for seeking work on whaling ships by Stubb (Harry Andrews). He is questioned, and after his answers are deemed satisfactory he is accepted by a group of seamen and he joins in drinking songs with them. During the storm, they spot the mysterious Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck) walking in the rainWhen his room and bed mate, a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg (Friedrich von Ledebur), returns very late and discovers Ishmael in the bed under the blankets, both men are alarmed, but the two quickly become close friends and decide to sail together on a whaling ship.The duo signs on with the Pequod, a whaling ship that is soon to leave port. Two owner partners make the hiring decisions and negotiate the compensation, which is a fraction of the profit from the voyage.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  Now, I have a new situation: There are two cities, Chien and Marisol, in France that are leaders in the amount of wine they export to the rest of the world. Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation.  Answer this question please: Does Marisol have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Chien? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, Marisol has a lower chance of experiencing acid rain compared to Chien. The main reason for this difference is the source of power each city utilizes for generating electricity. Chien relies on coal to generate its electricity. Coal, as a fossil fuel, releases various pollutants when burned, including sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). When these pollutants combine with water vapor in the atmosphere, they form sulfuric and nitric acids, which will then fall back to the ground in the form of precipitation, leading to acid rain. Acid rain can have numerous damaging effects on the environment, including harming soil, waterways, vegetation, and aquatic life. It may also negatively impact human health and structures, such as buildings and monuments. On the other hand, Marisol uses nuclear power plants for electricity generation. Nuclear energy involves the process of nuclear fission, in which the nucleus of an atom, usually uranium, is split to release energy in the form of heat. This heat is then used to generate electricity without burning any fuel and consequently, do not release pollutants like SO2 and NOx which are the primary drivers of acid rain formation. Though it's true that nuclear energy relies on non-renewable materials and generates radioactive waste, when considering the risk of acid rain, Marisol's reliance on nuclear power makes it less prone to this environmental issue compared to Chien, which relies on coal. In the context of the ongoing debate on electricity generation methods, the citizens of Marisol would be voting on whether to continue using nuclear power, which does not cause acid rain or air pollution, but does pose other challenges, such as the potential risks associated with nuclear accidents and the management of radioactive waste. In conclusion, Marisol has a lower chance of acid rain compared to Chien due to its use of nuclear power for electricity generation, which does not release the pollutants responsible for acid rain formation like coal combustion does. However, it is worth noting that while nuclear energy has environmental advantages in this regard, it is not without its challenges and should be carefully considered in conjunction with other renewable and sustainable energy sources for a comprehensive approach to energy production."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A fertility specialist had told her that this would never happen, Max says, because of the chemotherapy Elizabeth underwent to beat sarcoma in 2010.      \\"It very much felt like a miracle,\\" he says. \\"Bringing a child into this world -- I mean, it wasn't just important for me; it was one of the most important things for Liz.\\"      Then, one month into her pregnancy, Elizabeth's cancer returned, he says.      Surgeons removed the tumors in her back, but she needed a full-body MRI scan to know whether the cancer had spread. Because an MRI's contrast dyes may damage a developing fetus, she faced a difficult decision. She could either terminate her pregnancy to undergo the scan or continue with the pregnancy without knowing her true cancer status.      \\"We felt that if we terminated this pregnancy and did these scans, if it turned out that there was no evidence of this disease after the scans, then we would have possibly given up our only chance at having a child naturally and would have done it for nothing,\\" Max said.      \\"It was a calculated risk. We knew there was a possibility of a worst-case scenario, but we also thought there was a good chance that we could have the baby.\\"      Shortly after becoming pregnant, Elizabeth was introduced to filmmaker Christopher Henze. His upcoming documentary on pregnancy and motherhood will include the Joices' story.      \\"It took about three minutes to realize that Liz was a stellar human being, and I wanted her for my movie,\\" Henze said. \\"I was impressed by the way she looked at cancer as another problem to be solved.\\"      Even though a shielded chest X-ray taken in November found no sign of cancer, by January, she was having trouble breathing. Another X-ray revealed tumors in her lungs. Her C-section date was moved up, and on January 23 -- six weeks early -- Lily Joice was born.      \\"It was incredibly difficult to want to enjoy this amazing moment as much as you possibly can,\\" Max said. \\"Yet to know that you're facing something so incredibly dire, and the chances didn't look good at that point.\\"      After delivery, doctors found cancer in Elizabeth's heart, abdomen and pelvis.      She died in the hospital on March 9. She was 36.      \\"In the face of this life-threatening illness,\\" her husband said, \\"she was so optimistic and so strong and so willing to go through whatever fight she would have to go through in order to have this baby.\\"      Henze delivered a eulogy at Elizabeth's funeral.      \\"Lots of people say 'Liz was'; I say 'Liz is,' \\" Henze said. \\"Through her spirit and grace, she is still affecting people, and she will through the movie, will continue to impact people. Liz is.\\"      CNN's Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report. ||||| Elizabeth Joice was only a few months pregnant when she received a devastating diagnosis, the cancer she thought had been eradicated years earlier had returned.      Joice, 36, had already agreed to be a part of a documentary exploring each week of pregnancy called “40 Weeks” when she received her diagnosis. Director Christopher Henze said that after Joice learned of her diagnosis she was faced with a choice either to abort the pregnancy or continue it with limited options on how to diagnose and treat the disease.      Joice chose to continue her pregnancy and had her baby in January. But she died last month, six weeks after giving birth.      Joice was initially declared cancer-free in 2010, but the chemotherapy had pushed her into early menopause. As a result, Henze said both Joice and her husband, Max Joice, were amazed when she became pregnant last year.      Joice’s cancer, non-differentiated sarcoma, could be partially removed by operation. However, dyes used during scans could impact Joice’s pregnancy, so a full body scan was not done to see if there were other tumors. The Joices decided against more invasive scanning and treatment and hoped the cancer would not be virulent.      “Around week 25 or 26, they went through the process of removing it and [she] seemed healthy. We felt as positive as we could be,” said Henze, who, with his crew, had been following Joice through pregnancy and cancer appointments.      Joice appeared to love being pregnant even after she had to juggle morning sickness with cancer treatments, Henze said.      “I would do this for living if I could,” Joice told Henze in an on-camera interview. \\"I really enjoy pregnancy a lot ... all the stuff that’s been happening has all been really cool stuff.\\"      Towards the end of the pregnancy, there were signs that the cancer had returned, as Joice had trouble breathing, Henze said. A scan revealed a mass in her lungs, and doctors ordered that Joice deliver immediately.      Joice’s daughter, Lily, was delivered by c-section in late January, six weeks early.      Dr. Joanne Stone, the director for Maternal Fetal Medicine at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, treated Joice and said there were signs during the c-section to suggest the cancer had returned.      \\"There were tons of tumor[s],\\" Stone said. \\"It had spread all over her abdomen.\\"      Although Stone was worried about Joice's breathing, especially because of the mass in her lungs, she said the first thing Joice said when the breathing tube was removed was, \\"How’s Lily? How’s the baby?\\"      \\"Her first thoughts were not 'Am I OK?,\\" said Stone.      Further scans revealed Joice had tumors throughout her abdomen. Although she was put into treatment, the cancer advanced rapidly and she died March 9.      When Joice first told Henze about the diagnosis, Henze said, he had hoped her story would be one of recovery and that she could have seen the documentary released.      “Her spirit is really beautifully positive. She’s so open and thoughtful and considerate and honest,” Henze said. “As a documentarian, that’s what you’re always looking for. With Liz, it was not only getting her honest feeling. ... I was brought into her family.”      Stone called Joice a \\"remarkable\\" person with a \\"sense of love and life.\\" Stone recalled visiting Joice after she was released from the ICU and was meeting her newborn for the first time.      \\"She was holding the baby. Just the joy on her face was just incredible,\\" said Stone. \\"She said ‘This is worth it. ... I would do it all again to have this child.'\\" |||||Summary:","output":"Elizabeth Joice was a woman who had cancer but got better after treatment. She was told that she wouldn't be able to have a baby because of the treatment she had. However, she got pregnant and was very happy with her husband, Max. When she was one month pregnant, her cancer came back. She had to make a difficult choice: she could end the pregnancy to get tests to see how bad her cancer was, or she could continue being pregnant without knowing about her cancer. Elizabeth decided to continue the pregnancy and gave birth to a baby girl named Lily. Unfortunately, her cancer got worse and she passed away six weeks after giving birth.

I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\"?","output":"Question: According to the passage, what are the steps involved in the process of handling serious sins within the Jehovah's Witness congregation, and what are the various forms of discipline administered based on the offender's level of repentance and the seriousness of the sin? The passage outlines the manner in which the Jehovah's Witness congregation deals with serious sins committed by its baptized members, especially cases of sexual misconduct or apostasy, and the different forms of discipline that are applied based on the individual's level of repentance and the gravity of the offense. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin, a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help, and possibly administer discipline. There are different forms of discipline outlined in the passage, depending on the severity of the sin and the individual's level of repentance. 1. Disfellowshipping: This is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. It entails shunning the individual, with contact limited to direct family members living in the same home, congregation elders who may invite them to apply for reinstatement, and maintaining formal business dealings if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that this practice keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and may help the shunned individual realize the seriousness of their wrong and take steps to return to Jehovah. It also serves as a deterrent for other members from engaging in dissident behavior. 2. Disassociation: Members who formally resign are described as wicked in Watch Tower Society literature and are also shunned. Similar to disfellowshipped individuals, disassociated members can eventually be reinstated into the congregation if deemed repentant by the congregation elders who enforced the disfellowshipping or disassociation. 3. Reproof: This is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is deemed repentant of serious sin. The reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service but does not face any restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. 4. Marking: This form of discipline curtails social, but not spiritual, fellowship and is practiced when a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles, but not deemed a serious sin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The ice was not drifting fast enough to be noticeable, although by late November the speed was up to seven miles (11 km) a day. By 5 December, they had passed 68°S, but the direction was turning slightly east of north. This was taking them to a position from which it would be difficult to reach Snow Hill Island, although Paulet Island, further north, remained a possibility. It was about 250 miles (400 km) away, and Shackleton was anxious to reduce the length of the lifeboat journey that would be necessary to reach it. Therefore, on 21 December he announced a second march, to begin on 23 December.Conditions, however, had not improved since the earlier attempt. Temperatures had risen and it was uncomfortably warm, with men sinking to their knees in soft snow as they struggled to haul the boats through the pressure ridges. On 27 December, carpenter Harry McNish rebelled and refused to work. He argued that Admiralty law had lapsed since Endurance's sinking, and that he was no longer under orders. Shackleton's firm remonstrance finally brought the carpenter to heel, but the incident was never forgotten. Two days later, with only seven and a half miles' (12 km) progress achieved in seven back-breaking days, Shackleton called a halt, observing: \\"It would take us over three hundred days to reach the land\\". The crew put up their tents and settled into what Shackleton called \\"Patience Camp\\", which would be their home for more than three months.Supplies were now running low. Hurley and Macklin were sent back to Ocean Camp to recover food that had been left there to lighten the sledging teams’ burden. On 2 February 1916, Shackleton sent a larger party back, to recover the third lifeboat. Food shortages became acute as the weeks passed, and seal meat, which had added variety to their diet, now became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations.

Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun. Most of the particles are attracted to the north and south magnetic poles. This is where Earths magnetic field is strongest. This is also where relatively few organisms live. Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Daniel Hillel developed drip irrigation   techniques. The techniques make farming possible in places where there is not enough water. Because of this, he won this year's World Food Prize. Hillel is using the techniques in his orchards   near his home in Israel. Irrigating drop by drop -- called drip irrigation -- has changed agriculture by greatly reducing the amount of water needed. Farmers now rely on it in places from Spain, to Africa, to America. \\"We in California grow about 50 percent of the fruits and vegetables of the continental United States,\\" says Jan Hopmans from University of California at Davis. \\"And these drip irrigation techniques make it possible.\\" Hillel got his start in dry land farming in Israel's Negev Desert in the 1950s. \\"The key was making good use of water,\\" he says. \\"There's much land. Water is limited.\\" These farmers did not have the advantage of running irrigation water through channels   to their crops. So Hillel and others gave plants just what they needed and just where they needed it. \\"The idea is to use water little by little,\\" Hillel says. It worked so well that Hillel was soon traveling around the world, showing others how to do it. Experts say drip irrigation's importance is growing, as climate change and rising population make water supplies become few in many parts of the world. \\"This is where water use, climate change and crop production all meet at one point,\\" Hillel says. \\"And this has been really the essence   of my career.\\" A career whose importance can be measured drop by drop.

Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter.

Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions!

The White House provided few details about the festivities but confirmed that the president and his guests would be dining on shrimp harvested from the Gulf of Mexico.

His wife and younger daughter returned from a brief vacation in Spain in time for the barbecue, and his elder daughter was at camp.

The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established.

Definition: You're given a fill-in-the-blank question where the answer is PersonX. You need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to PersonY. This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"sympathetic\\" to \\"stern\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two i.e. the trigger word/phrase. PersonX and PersonY should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For your question, PersonY should be a well-agreed answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use the names of real people or generic names (e.g., Donald Trump, John Doe, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In your question, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY. Although there are many correct answers, you only need to write one of them. Input: Context Word: California.  Question: PersonX said goodbye to PersonY, his best friend who was going to California to star in a movie, and _ was very sad.  Answer: PersonX Output:","output":"Explanation: The task here requires us to slightly modify the provided question so that the answer changes from PersonX to PersonY, without altering the content significantly. We are essentially turning the focus of the narrative from PersonX to PersonY while keeping the narrative context, i.e. someone going to California to star in a movie, the same. We need to find a suitable 'trigger word' that can be replaced with its antonym so that the action accredited to PersonX would now be accredited to PersonY. Also, it has been instructed to ensure that the revised question should not comprise more than 30 words and less than 15 words, and should have at least 70% overlapping words with the initial question. Plus, PersonX and PersonY should maintain the same gender and should be utilized one time only in proper order with PersonX preceding PersonY.  Let's solve the task: Initial question: PersonX said goodbye to PersonY, his best friend who was going to California to star in a movie, and _ was very sad. By changing the trigger word 'sad' to 'happy' and adjust the context accordingly to reflect the change in the narrative subject from PersonX to PersonY.  Modified question: PersonX said goodbye to PersonY, his best friend who was going to California to star in a movie, and _ was very excited. Explanation: By switching the emotion from 'sad' to 'excited', the perspective shifts from PersonX to PersonY. Now the emphasis is on how PersonY feels about going to California to star in a movie, therefore answer changes from PersonX to PersonY. The modified question stays within the word count requirement while satisfying all other given conditions as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective. Question: What happened before the book Dealing With Disrespect was written?

An anti-government protest in Moscow turned violent Sunday, with some demonstrators clashing with police after they veered off their agreed-upon route. More than 250 people were arrested, including leading opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, leftist radical group leader Sergei Udaltsov and popular blogger Alexei Navalny, Moscow police told CNN. They were among the thousands that descended on the Russian capital for the latest demonstration denouncing Vladimir Putin, the nation's current prime minister who was recently elected to a six-year term as president. He is set to be inaugurated Monday. As they marched, many chanted slogans such as \\"Russia without Putin\\" and \\"Putin is a thief.\\" A large number of demonstrators did not follow the route to Bolotnaya Square that their leaders had agreed to with Moscow authorities, instead stopping in front of a line of police and refusing to move. Clashes broke out, with some protesters throwing various objects -- including sticks and at least one flare -- at police. Authorities responded by \\"clubbing demonstrators\\" who briefly broke through police lines, the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported. One of its correspondents saw \\"a male protester out cold after clashing with officers,\\" while another reported eight officers arresting one demonstrator \\"for the apparent crime of wearing a Guy Fawkes' mask,\\" the symbol of the vigilante hacking group Anonymous. Twenty officers were injured and three hospitalized in the clashes, according to RIA-Novosti, which added that those charged with assaulting police may face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Itar-Tass, another official news agency, said four officers suffered cuts and wounds after having stones and bottles thrown at them and reporters. Police denied that they used tear gas as had been reported, according to RIA-Novosti. After the arrests, authorities slowly moved forward and moved everyone out of the area. Many protesters expressed disappointment that the event was not peaceful, with some saying they were angry at those who they felt had provoked a confrontation with police. Others who faced off with authorities voiced frustration that previous peaceful rallies had done little to forward their political aims. In March, Putin won the country's presidential election with nearly 65% of the vote, claiming victory amid allegations by independent polling monitors of widespread electoral violations. International observers said there was legitimate uncertainty about the vote, with chess champion-turned opposition activist Garry Kasparov accusing Putin's supporters of \\"massive fraud.\\" Putin, the former KGB officer who has worked to both stabilize Russia's economy and curtail dissent, held the presidency for eight years before term limits forced him to step down in 2008. His election followed a series of anti-Kremlin protests in the wake of disputed parliamentary elections that took place in December.

Describing his political views, Zappa categorized himself as a \\"practical conservative\\". He favored limited government and low taxes; he also stated that he approved of national defense, social security, and other federal programs, but only if recipients of such programs are willing and able to pay for them. He favored capitalism, entrepreneurship, and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning their own businesses than from collecting royalties. He opposed communism, stating, \\"A system that doesn't allow ownership ... has—to put it mildly—a fatal design flaw.\\" He had always encouraged his fans to register to vote on album covers, and throughout 1988 he had registration booths at his concerts. He even considered running for president of the United States as an independent.Zappa was an atheist. He recalled his parents being \\"pretty religious\\" and trying to make him go to Catholic school despite his resentment. He felt disgust towards organized religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and anti-intellectualism. Some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided Republicans and their policies, President Ronald Reagan, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), televangelism, and the Christian Right, and warned that the United States government was in danger of becoming a \\"fascist theocracy\\".In early 1990, Zappa visited Czechoslovakia at the request of President Václav Havel.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.  But I can use this background: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  What is an answer for this question: Who is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Ronaldo, who is a nutrition enthusiast and consumes a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol, is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff, who doesn't care about nutrition and consumes a diet with high amounts of fat and cholesterol. There are several reasons supporting this conclusion: 1. Caloric intake and overall energy balance: Consuming too many lipids can lead to a high caloric intake, given that lipids are very high in energy (9 calories per gram). If an individual consumes more energy than they spend through various activities, the excess energy can result in weight gain. Since Ronaldo is consuming a healthier diet with low amounts of fat and cholesterol, it is likely that his overall caloric intake is better balanced with his energy expenditure, given their similar physical activity levels. 2. Effects of dietary lipids on cardiovascular health: A high-fat diet, particularly one that is rich in saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol, can increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can contribute to an increased risk of developing health problems such as cardiovascular disease. Elevated levels of cholesterol are mainly responsible for narrowing arteries, which can further lead to atherosclerosis. By consuming a diet with lower levels of unhealthy fats, Ronaldo is reducing his risk for these health complications. 3. Quality of diet and bodily functions: A diet high in unhealthy lipids, like the one Jeff consumes, often lacks essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required for optimal body functioning. On the other hand, Ronaldo's nutrition-focused diet likely includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods. A well-balanced diet supports healthy bodily functions, hormonal balance, and metabolism, which in turn, can influence body weight regulation. 4. Formation of healthy habits and lifestyle choices: By being mindful of his diet and focusing on nutrition, Ronaldo is more likely to develop healthy habits that can have a long-lasting impact on his overall health and weight. This may include regular exercise, practicing portion control, being mindful of food choices, and making informed decisions about what he consumes. Jeff's carelessness about his diet and preference for unhealthy lipids might indicate a lack of interest or discipline in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which can contribute to weight gain over time. In conclusion, considering their dietary choices and habits, Ronaldo is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff, due to his well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet, controlled caloric intake, and better overall lifestyle choices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is best known for founding K-tel, which sold household gadgets including the \\"Miracle Brush\\", \\"Feather Touch Knife\\", \\"Veg-O-Matics\\", as well as many compilation record albums. Kives reputedly coined the catchphrase \\"As seen on TV\\", which was included in may of the company's advertisements. Kives utilized low-budget television commercials to sell millions of products and build an international business empire.  - Ronald M. \\"Ron\\" Popeil (born May 3, 1935) is an American inventor and marketing personality, best known for his direct response marketing company Ronco. He is well known for his appearances in infomercials for the Showtime Rotisserie (\\"Set it, and forget it!\\") and for using the phrase, \\"But wait, there's more!\\" on television as early as the mid-1950s.  - Marketing is the study and management of exchange relationships. The American Marketing Association has defined marketing as \\"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\\"   - Veg-O-Matic is the name of one of the first food-processing appliances to gain widespread use in the United States. It was non-electric and invented by Samuel J. Popeil and later sold by his son, Ron Popeil along with more than 20 other distributors across the country, and Ronco, making its début in 1963 at the International Housewares Show in Chicago, Illinois. It was also sold in Australia by Philip Kives, who purchased it from Samuel Popeil and sold it as one of the first products through his own marketing firm, K-tel.  - Ronco is an American company that manufactures and sells a variety of items and devices, most commonly those used in the kitchen. Ron Popeil founded the company in 1964, and commercials for the company's products soon became pervasive and memorable, in part thanks to Popeil's personal sales pitches. The names \\"Ronco\\" and \\"Popeil\\" and the suffix \\"-O-Matic\\" (used in many early product names) became icons of American popular culture and were often referred to by comedians introducing fictional gadgets.  - Philip Kives ( born 12 Feb 1929 ) is a Winnipeg business executive and innovative marketer . He is best known for founding K - tel , famous for its \`\` As seen on TV '' marketing strategies . A farm boy of Turkish extraction , born in Oungre , Saskatchewan , Kives showed a youthful passion for salesmanship . After completing high school , he gravitated into itinerant salesmanship in Winnipeg and at fairs , hawking gadgets as far away as Atlantic City , New Jersey .

K - tel eventually expanded to serve 34 national markets , and after a very successful 1970s , the company heavily invested in real estate , oil and gas exploration , films and video games in the early 80 's . This led to losses of  60 million in 1984 and the company eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection only to be rescued out of hard times by new CEO Mickey Elfenbein that same year . Kives excelled in identifying innovative products ( e.g. \`\` jazzed up '' classical melodies played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra ) . Financial overextension led to receivership in both Canada and the US in 1984 .

These products can range from kitchen, household, automotive, cleaning, health, and beauty products, to exercise and fitness products, books, or to toys and games for children. Typically the packaging for these items includes a standardized red seal in the shape of a CRT television screen with the words \\"AS SEEN ON TV\\" in white, an intentional allusion to the logo of \\"TV Guide\\" magazine.  - An infomercial is a form of television commercial, which generally includes a phone number or website. Most often used as a form of direct response television (DRTV), long-form infomercials are typically 28:30 or 58:30 minutes in length. Infomercials are also known as paid programming (or teleshopping in Europe). This phenomenon started in the United States, where infomercials were typically shown overnight (usually 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.), outside of peak prime time hours for commercial broadcasters. Some television stations chose to air infomercials as an alternative to the former practice of signing off. By 2009, most infomercial spending in the U.S. occurred during the early morning, daytime and evening hours. Stations in most countries around the world have instituted similar media structures. The infomercial industry is worth over 200 billion.    What is the relationship between 'philip kives' and '12 february 1929'?

Review: Here's an excellent Barbara Stanwyck double bill on one disc. The first movie - and believe me the lesser of the two - is MGM's \\"To Please A Lady\\" (1950) in which she is paired with Clark Gable. It is essentially a star vehicle with Gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence. Here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter Stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins. Of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close. A bit of a fluff of a move really but Gable and Stanwyck - two icons of the Golden Age - make it watchable! But the real meat on this DVD is the second feature - a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called JEOPARDY. Produced by MGM in 1953 this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasn't dated one iota! Here Stanwyck plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and mother to their young son Lee Aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote Mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes. A dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping Sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what? Yes,the tide is coming in. With not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself Stanwyck sets off by car for assistance. After driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict (Ralph Meeker) who - in return for his help - wants more from her than money or a change of clothes (\\"I'll do anything to save my husband\\"). Does she or doesn't she??.  Meeker runs away with the picture! He turns in quite a brilliant performance! Once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him! An actor in the smouldering Brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films. Although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury, disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding Mann/Stewart western \\"Naked Spur\\" (1953) and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in Stanley Kubrick's powerful WW1 drama \\"Paths Of Glory\\" (1957) his only real claim to fame was as Mike Hammer in Mickey Spillane's \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\" in 1955. His performance in \\"Jeopardy\\" should have done wonders for him but he had only a so-so career in films. He died in 1988. Because of this release \\"Jeopardy\\" can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir. A memorable, taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances, tight direction by John Sturges, the crisp Monochrome Cinematography of Victor Milner and an atmospheric score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Extras, however are no great shakes except for a radio version of \\"Jeopardy\\" and trailers for both movies. This disc is also part of a Barbara Stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary. Hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old if she was still around! JEOPARDY - an MGM winner! What is the sentiment of this review?

Paragraph: U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived here on Tuesday night for meetings with fellow foreign ministers aimed at solidifying a second front, in Southeast Asia, in the campaign against global terrorism. But he has had to balance that goal with longstanding concerns about human rights abuses in the region. In meetings on Tuesday in Malaysia and Singapore before touching down in this oil-producing sultanate for two days of talks with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, Powell said he repeatedly raised the issue. \\"We still believe strongly in human rights, and that everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights,\\" he said. But at a news conference in Singapore, Powell hinted that the Bush administration was ready to discuss resuming military cooperation with Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation and a sometimes reluctant partner in the efforts to crack down on militant Islamic groups. The United States cut virtually all military links with Indonesia in 1999 after its forces were implicated in the violence that swept East Timor after that territory voted for independence. On Thursday, Powell and representatives of the nations of the Asian group, including Indonesia, are expected to sign a declaration promising cooperation to prevent terrorism by sharing information, blocking funds, tightening borders and making it hard to use forged travel papers. \\"We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes, which continue to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by the international community,\\" the ministers said in a communique on Tuesday. Powell is among the representatives from 13 nations outside Southeast Asia, including China, Japan and Russia, that are taking part in the annual meeting of the group's regional forum. Terrorism dominates the agenda, though the possibility of a meeting here between Powell and his North Korean counterpart, Paek Nam Sun, has generated the most news. It would be the highest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since President Bush took office. Powell heads to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, late on Thursday before finishing a weeklong trip through the region in the Philippines on Saturday. He said that when he arrives in Jakarta, he will have \\"some ideas and some initiatives\\" to present to President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Indonesia is already receiving 400,000 in the current fiscal year for civilian training programs and is to receive a like amount next year; and the United States expects to provide an additional 16 million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism. At the same time, the Pentagon is reviewing how to allocate another 17 million in \\"counterterrorism fellowships,\\" some of which could go to Indonesia. But a senior State Department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and Congress are pushing for more direct military cooperation, which would require congressional approval. \\"I think they recognize the danger that we all face and I think they have been cooperating more fully with us as time goes by, and I'm quite sure that Mrs. Megawati is committed to this cause,\\" Powell said in Singapore. He met there with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who endorsed the idea of renewed military ties between the United States and Indonesia as an important step in stabilizing that country.

Question: How many times Irmgard Moller stabbed in the chest Title: The Baader Meinhof Complex Movie plot: The film begins on a nude beach in Germany in the late 1960s, where we are introduced to Ulrike Meinhoff, a respected journalist, and her family. Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire. On a television broadcast we are informed of the many student protests at universities across America and of protests in West Germany, being led by Rudi Dutschke. The film then cuts to a famous rally where Dutschke announced his views on the protest and wars occurring around the world, trying to spark everyone to join their resistance. Rudi Dutschke is then almost assassinated by a man who is accused to be from the Springer Group, which is tied to the German Government. In effect, many activists go to the Springer Group headquarters and riot.

Make the big plant sleepy: We need to give the big plant a nap by not watering it for about a week before taking out the baby plants. 4. Take out the baby plants: Carefully dig around the base of the baby plant with a spoon or your fingers. Gently wiggle it to loosen the roots and pull the baby plant out. 5. Put the baby plant in the new pot: Make a little hole in the special soil in the small pot. Put the baby plant's roots in the hole and cover it with the soil. Don't pack it in too tight; let the soil be a bit loose. 6. Wait before watering: The baby plant needs time to recover from its adventure. Wait for 2-3 days before giving it some water. 7. Water and sunshine: Give the baby aloe plant some water and place it in a spot where it gets bright but indirect light. Soon, it will grow and become a big aloe plant just like its parent!

After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II, with the popular action film \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\" (a.k.a. \\"Judo Saga\\"). After the war, the critically acclaimed \\"Drunken Angel\\" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. His wife Yko Yaguchi was also an actress in one of his films.  - The Venice Film Festival or Venice International Film Festival (\\"International Exhibition of Cinematographic Art of the Venice Biennale\\"), founded in 1932, is the oldest film festival in the world and one of the \\"Big Three\\" film festivals alongside the Cannes Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival.  - After leaving Dokkyo University without graduating, he started to earn his living as an illustrator, writer and pornographic cartoonist. He joined a theatre called Hakken no Kai in 1978 and he made a screen debut in \\"Zokubutsu Zukan\\" (based on the book by Yasutaka Tsutsui) in 1982.

In a university setting, you are most likely to find fungus in a biology laboratory. This is because fungi are an important subject of study for many researchers and students, particularly those who focus on microbiology, plant pathology, and ecology. Biology laboratories are equipped with the appropriate facilities and equipment needed for growing, culturing, and studying fungi in a controlled environment, ensuring that their growth, reproduction, and behavior can be monitored and documented safely and accurately. Option A, a cave, is not necessarily relevant to a university setting unless there is a specific research project or field study involving caves and the ecosystem within them. Option C, decaying matter, could potentially be found in compost heaps or in waste management areas within a university, but these would not be the primary areas for fungal study. Option D, mushroom hunting, may be an activity performed by mycology students or researchers, but it typically occurs outside of the university in woodlands or other natural environments. And option E, old cheese, while sure to contain fungus, is unlikely to be a primary source for fungal samples within a university setting. Therefore, option B, a biology laboratory, would be the most accurate answer, as it is within the university and directly relates to the controlled and systematic study of fungi."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

English Dissenters or Protestant Separatists were English Christians who separated from the Church of England in the 16th , 17th and 18th centuries .","output":"Yes, these two statements essentially convey the same information but with slightly different wording. Both statements refer to the same group of people: English Christians who chose to separate from the established Church of England during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. These individuals are collectively known as Dissenters or Protestant Separatists. To clarify the similarities and differences between the two statements, here is a detailed breakdown: Statement 1: - \\"Dissident or Protestant separatists\\": The term \\"dissident\\" is synonymous with \\"dissenter,\\" meaning someone who disagrees with the established norms or beliefs. In this context, it refers to people who objected to the teachings and practices of the Church of England. - \\"English Christians\\": This specifies that the dissenters were from England and followed the Christian faith. - \\"Separated from the English Church\\": This highlights the core element of their dissent -- separating from the established Church of England. - \\"16th, 17th, and 18th centuries\\": This time frame indicates when these dissenting movements occurred. Statement 2: - \\"English Dissenters or Protestant Separatists\\": This phrase mirrors the meaning of \\"dissident or Protestant separatists\\" from the first statement, referring to the same group of people who challenged the Church of England's doctrines and practices. - \\"English Christians\\": Like the first statement, this specifies that the dissenters were from England and followed the Christian faith. - \\"Separated from the Church of England\\": This phrase also emphasizes the act of separation, as in the first statement. - \\"16th, 17th, and 18th centuries\\": The time frame is identical, indicating the same period of dissent and separation from the Church. In summary, both statements mean the same, describing English Christians who separated from the Church of England (also known as the 'English Church') in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries and labeling them as either Dissidents, Dissenters or Protestant Separatists. The minor difference between the phrasing used ('Dissident' vs 'English Dissenter') does not change the overall meaning of the statements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under).

Catwoman is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, the character made her debut as \\"the Cat\\" in Batman #1 (June 1940). Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, has been Batman's most enduring love interest and is known for her complex love-hate relationship with him. As a Gotham City burglar, Catwoman typically wears a tight, one-piece outfit and uses a bullwhip for a weapon. In 2011, DC Comics relaunched all titles, deemed the New 52, which rebooted the DC Universe continuity. Catwoman's monthly title now focused on Selina's earlier days as Catwoman, but not her origins. The series begins with Selina frantically escaping from unknown masked men who are invading her apartment. After flitting from rooftop to rooftop, Selina looks back just in time to see her apartment blown apart by explosives. She turns to her informant, Lola, who often supplies Catwoman with information and various jobs. In this instance, Lola tips Selina off to an unoccupied penthouse where Selina can lay low for a few weeks, as well as a job stealing a painting from Russian mobsters. For this job, Selina infiltrates a Russian club by posing as the bartender. There, she recognizes a man who murdered a friend of hers, and she takes her revenge. Once her cover is blown, Selina dons her Catwoman outfit and fights her way out of the club. It is revealed through Selina's inner monologue that she and Batman are lovers, and the premiere issue ends with the first sex scene between the two. Her revised origin in Catwoman #0 draws from Batman Returns.  Catwoman is later confronted by Steve Trevor, who offers her a spot on Amanda Waller's new Justice League of America. Selina initially refuses, but accepts the offer after Trevor promises to help her track down a woman who has apparently been posing as Selina. It is later revealed that Catwoman was chosen specifically to take down Batman should the JLA ever need to defeat the original Justice League. The teams eventually come into conflict in the publisher's \\"Trinity War\\" crossover.  In the Earth-Two continuity, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne are married, and their daughter, Helena Wayne, is that universe's Robin. In this universe, either Selina has reformed or was never a supervillain in the first place. It is revealed in issue #0 of Worlds' Finest that this Selina was killed while trying to stop what she believed was a human trafficking ring. What is the New 52?","output":"The New 52 is a major relaunch and revamp of the entire line of DC Comics superhero comic books, which began in September 2011. This initiative was aimed at attracting new readers to the world of DC Comics by providing a fresh start to their characters' storylines. The New 52 involved the cancellation of all existing titles and the introduction of 52 new series, featuring updated versions of popular characters like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and The Flash, as well as titles featuring lesser-known or new characters. In the New 52 continuity, the history of the DC Universe was altered, and characters' backstories and relationships were reimagined. This universe-wide reboot aimed to streamline and modernize the stories while preserving some iconic elements. However, it received mixed reactions from both fans and critics. Some appreciated the revitalization of certain characters and story arcs, while others were unhappy with the changes made to beloved heroes and the loss of decades of comic book history. The New 52 not only impacted well-known characters like Batman and Catwoman, as mentioned in your information, but also extended its influence to lesser-known characters and teams. It provided an entry point for new readers who were not familiar with the extensive and intricate history of the characters, making the comics more accessible to a wider audience. In 2016, DC Comics launched another initiative called \\"DC Rebirth,\\" which sought to address the criticisms of the New 52 and restore some of the legacy and history that had been lost during the reboot. As a result, the New 52 continuity was merged with elements from the previous continuity, creating a more coherent and balanced universe for the characters and their stories."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A team of scientists from City University of Hong Kong have developed an invisible coating made from the mineral anatase titanium dioxide, which triggers a chemical reaction when exposed to light for 24 hours. They predict it will soon hit the mainstream market, especially since it only raises the overall price of cashmere by about one per cent. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Groundbreaking Invisible Coating Revolutionizes Cashmere Industry Introduction: A team of dedicated scientists from City University of Hong Kong has made an incredible breakthrough with the development of an invisible coating made from the mineral anatase titanium dioxide. This groundbreaking innovation is predicted to hit the mainstream market very soon, and with its minimal impact on the overall price of cashmere (only about a one per cent increase), it has the potential to revolutionize the cashmere industry. (Step 1: Introduce the topic and details of the innovation while highlighting the potential benefits and impact on the cashmere industry.) Body: Invisible Coating's Composition and Function: The innovative coating is made from anatase titanium dioxide, a mineral known for its photocatalytic properties. When exposed to light for 24 hours, the coating undergoes a chemical reaction that makes it virtually invisible. The scientists behind this development believe this could lead to a wide range of applications within the textile industry, particularly for cashmere products. (Step 2: Explain the composition of the invisible coating and how it functions when exposed to light.) Mainstream Market Predictions and Impact on Cashmere Industry: As this invisible coating is anticipated to hit the mainstream market in the near future, experts predict that it will be embraced by the textile industry. Cashmere is a luxurious, soft wool material known for its warmth, durability, and comfort. However, it is usually quite expensive, making the addition of this new technology even more appealing. (Step 3: Discuss the potential entry of the invisible coating in the mainstream market and its significance to the cashmere industry.) The coating's minimal impact on the overall price of cashmere (raising it by only about one per cent) means that it can be incorporated into cashmere products without significantly affecting their pricing. This opens up new opportunities for high-quality, protective coatings on cashmere garments, effectively increasing their functionality and value in the marketplace. (Step 4: Describe the main benefit of the coating's impact on the cashmere industry - affordability and minimal price increase due to the use of the coating.) Exciting Opportunities for the Textile Industry: The anatase titanium dioxide coating offers numerous benefits for the textile industry as a whole.

But we were in the area and needed some fast food,  so what the heck, why not? We were greeted when we walked in and asked to sit wherever we wanted.  The place was dead; most people coming in were ordering to-go.   Our waitress was meek and soft spoken,  but she was on point for refills.  My husband and brother-in-law guzzled down at least 4 cokes a piece.  I took advantage of the Yelp check in offer and got 12 garlic knots for free! They came out after 10 minutes and were promptly demolished.  The knots were served up hot and loaded with garlic and parmesan cheese.   We all ordered from the \\"specials\\" menu. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza with a side of garlic knots (3.99). It was 0.50 extra to add mushrooms.  My husband got the same special but with pepperoni.  The brother-in-law ordered a large pepperoni pizza (7.99). When the food came out,  it was seriously right off the oven. The pizzas had the perfect amount of cheese.  Our grand total for two people?  11.32!!   When all is said and done, the only major complaint I had was that it took just under 30 minutes to get our meals. Under normal circumstances we wouldn't have minded but it just so happened we were in a rush. We ordered pizzas and garlic knots- not anything crazy like a time consuming calzone.

A:","output":"The last step of the process is the formation and dispersion of new spores, which ensures the continuation of the mold's life cycle and potential colonization of new environments. This can be further elaborated as follows: 1. Formation of sporangia: At the tips of the sporangiophores, reproductive structures called sporangia begin to develop. These structures, which can come in various shapes such as spheres, ovals, or capsules, are responsible for housing the mold's spores. The sporangia are filled with a large number of spores, which are small, reproductive cells that serve as the \\"seeds\\" for new mold colonies. 2. Spore maturation: Within the sporangium, the spores undergo maturation, a process in which they become structurally stable and more resistant to environmental factors such as temperature fluctuations, desiccation, and radiation. The mold produces spore walls made of chitin and other polymers, which help protect the genetic material inside the spores and increase their odds of survival during dissemination. In addition, some mold species produce pigments to shield their spores from ultraviolet radiation. 3. Sporangium dehiscence and spore release: Once the spores are mature and ready for dispersal, the sporangium wall ruptures through a process known as dehiscence. This exposes the spores to the external environment and allows them to be released into the air. Various factors can trigger sporangium dehiscence, including mechanical forces (e.g., wind, rain, or contact with other organisms) and changes in environmental conditions (e.g., humidity and temperature fluctuations). 4. Spore dissemination: Upon release from the sporangia, the spores become airborne and drift away from their parent colony. Mold spores are extremely lightweight and easily carried by air currents, enabling them to travel vast distances. Throughout their journey, they may encounter various obstacles such as physical barriers and predators (e.g., bacteria, mites, and insects). However, their small size and robust structure enable a portion of them to survive and reach new, suitable substrates where they can germinate and establish new colonies. 5. Germination and the initiation of a new life cycle: When a mold spore eventually lands on a suitable substrate, it absorbs water and nutrients and starts to germinate. This involves the growth of hyphae, which are thread-like structures that extend into the substrate and begin to break down organic matter to obtain nutrients for the developing mold. Over time, the new colony will expand by producing more hyphae and gaining nutrients from its environment. Eventually, the new colony will also start producing sporangiophores to produce and disperse new spores, thus completing the life cycle and perpetuating the propagation of the mold species."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Megan craved romance.  2). Patricia craved romance.","output":"Megan wanted to make an action movie but Patricia did not because Patricia craved romance. In this scenario, Megan is enthusiastic about creating an action movie, most likely for a project, personal enjoyment, or even as part of their career aspirations. Action movies generally fall under the genre of action and adventure, typically featuring adrenaline-fueled scenes, suspenseful storylines, and engaging battles or feats of strength. These movies tend to resonate with audiences who enjoy high-stake chases, impressive displays of physical ability, and overcoming impossible odds. Megan seemingly finds excitement and appeal in these elements and wishes to bring these ideas to life in her film project. On the other hand, Patricia is opposed to the idea of making an action movie. The reason stated is that she craves romance. It implies that Patricia has a penchant for romance-themed movies. Films of this genre tend to focus on the relationships and emotional connections between characters. The plot may revolve around growing love, overcoming obstacles to be together, or other situations that evoke strong emotional responses from the audience. Patricia would rather create a film that allows its viewers to connect with the characters and their emotional journeys on a deeper level, delving into themes of love, mutual understanding, and compassion. This contrast in preference between Megan and Patricia could lead to several possible outcomes. They might decide to go their separate ways and create two separate movies that cater to their individual interests. Alternatively, Megan and Patricia could engage in a discussion about both of their ideas and potentially find a way to incorporate aspects of action and romance into a single film, as seen in many successful hybrid-genre movies. This would require collaboration, compromise, and respecting each other's creative vision. Another possibility is that they decide to partake in multiple projects, each working together on the other's preferred genre in turn. Regardless of the solution they choose, the difference in their preferences does not mean one is superior or more valid than the other. Both action and romance movies have their audience, and people's tastes vary significantly. It is essential to appreciate and acknowledge the diversity of themes, stories, and genres within the film industry and celebrate the creative minds that bring them to life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Firstly, the premise states that \\"it will also improve visibility over much of the country.\\" This statement tells us that an action, policy, or event under discussion (represented by \\"it\\") will have a positive impact on visibility across a significant part of the country. The extent of this impact is not explicitly quantified, but it is implied that it would be widespread and noticeable. Secondly, the premise becomes more specific by pointing out that \\"the scenic vistas in national parks such as the Grand Canyon\\" would particularly benefit from the improvement in visibility. This part of the premise not only narrows down the focus on certain specific areas with scenic vistas but also explicitly includes the Grand Canyon as one of the examples where this improvement would be seen. Now turning our attention to the hypothesis \\"The Grand Canyon will see an improvement in visibility thanks to it,\\" we can clearly see that it is a logical consequence of the premise given. The premise's statement that visibility will improve in the country, particularly in national parks such as the Grand Canyon, leads us to deduce that the Grand Canyon's visibility will indeed improve because of the said action, policy, or event (represented by \\"it\\"). Since the premise directly identifies the Grand Canyon as an area that would benefit from the visibility improvement, it supports the hypothesis. Therefore, if the premise is true, it logically entails that the visibility at the Grand Canyon will improve due to the action, policy, or event under discussion.

When the atmospheric conditions are just suitable enough, it condenses the water vapors to form water droplets, which combine and fall down as precipitation, taking forms such as rain, snow, sleet or hail. The use of an umbrella becomes necessary and most common during instances of rainfall, which is the most frequent and familiar form of precipitation across the world. The main function of an umbrella, with its waterproof material and dome shape, is to shield you from the rain and keep you dry. As the droplets fall from the sky, the umbrella acts like a protective barrier between you and the water. Thus, if the sky is overcast and there is a prediction of rain, it is safe to carry an umbrella while going out. Additionally, aside from rainfall, there are other types weather conditions which might necessitate the use of an umbrella. These include snowfall and sleet. In colder regions, the atmospheric water vapors often freeze and form snowflakes, which fall down as snow. Similarly, sleet is a mixture of rain and snow. In these situations, an umbrella can protect you from getting wet and cold.  In some regions, particularly in tropical climates, people also use umbrellas as a shield against the blazing sun. In such cases, the umbrella serves to provide shade and reduce exposure to the UV radiation from the sun. Moreover, the need for an umbrella could also arise from geographical factors if you live in an area with a high incidence of rainfall such as coastal regions or areas near large water bodies. In certain regions with high humidity levels, due to topographical and climatic factors, the rate of precipitation could be high throughout the year, making umbrellas a daily necessity. Hence, in conclusion, the need to use an umbrella could be due to several factors, but it’s mainly a result of precipitation, which is when water falls from the sky in the form of rain, sleet, or snow. By providing an effective means of protection against these elements, umbrellas enable us to carry out our daily tasks in spite of unfavorable weather conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things...

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command.

Vice Admiral Simon Lister says the Navy is overly reliant on civilians to repair its craft, which are then left limping back to port for repairs. A serving Admiral has launched a scathing attack on the state of the Royal Navy, claiming it has been reduced to a collection of broken-down ships and ageing submarines whose crews are demoralised and poorly trained. In an extremely unusual move for such a high-ranking officer, Vice Admiral Simon Lister blamed Government spending cuts for undermining the Navy’s ability to carry out its duties. Admiral Lister complained that:. Admiral Lister, who joined the Navy in 1978, is a nuclear and engineering expert. Writing in a military journal, he said: ‘The price of unrelenting operational tempo is unsustainable pressure on engineers as every opportunity for maintenance is squeezed out of busy programmes. ‘For example, the lack of operators trained to stream and recover Type 23 towed sonar. ‘Overall material readiness continues to decline. From the submarine perspective, the numbers of force elements at readiness have been driven low by late delivery of Astute [a new model of submarine] and platform ageing. ‘Support is increasingly over-reliant on [civilians] for repair. This philosophy builds in declining competence and confidence.’ Admiral Lister cited the submarine HMS Trenchant, which was due to be retired in 2011, yet completed a 333-day deployment – the longest-ever by a British nuclear vessel – over 2012-13. HMS Dauntless, a £1bn destroyer, was forced to abandon exercises in February after suffering a loss of power. A number of vessels have also had to be towed back to Britain after malfunctioning at sea. In February, HMS Dauntless, a destroyer, was forced to abandon exercises and seek emergency repairs after losing power. The 8,000-ton ship, which cost more than £1 billion to build, suffered a similar problem off Senegal in 2012, as did her sister ship HMS Daring in 2009 and 2012. Engineers were unable to fix the faults and the ships had to limp to the nearest port. In his report, published in The Naval Engineer, Admiral Lister also criticised a ‘churn and outflow’ of staff, which was coupled with ‘reduced training investment and increasing transfer of engineering responsibility to [civilians].’ The MoD said: ‘The Admiral is merely pointing out the obvious facts given the shortage of engineers across the maritime industry. 'It is a challenge to recruit and retain these skilled personnel. We are offering incentives and excellent training.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Vice Admiral Simon Lister has criticized the state of the Royal Navy, attributing the decline to government spending cuts, and has raised concerns regarding the readiness and maintenance of the naval fleet. Stating that the navy is over-reliant on civilian support for repair work, he points out that this has led to decreasing competence and confidence amongst naval forces. Additionally, Admiral Lister highlights the prolonged usage of ageing submarines due to delays in the delivery of newer models, which has contributed to the declining material readiness of vessels. He also expresses concern about the reduction in training investment and the subsequent transfer of engineering responsibilities to civilians, which has further exacerbated demoralization and poor training among crew members. The MoD acknowledges these issues, attributing the problems to the shortage of engineers in the maritime industry and the challenge of retaining skilled personnel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose inventions always fail?  Set in the Stone Age, Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of cavemen. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is \\"clubbed\\" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life. After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt. He falls into a large pile of mammoth dung, then is eaten by the mammoth, and eventually excreted (or extracted – the scene itself appears as a series of animated cave drawings) from the mammoth when it is finally killed by the rest of the tribesmen.","output":"The name of the person whose inventions always fail is Ishbo.

Article: Babies who watch TV are more likely to show late learning development and language at 14 months, especially if they are watching programs aimed at adults and older children, according to a new study, which would probably surprise those parents who leave their babies in front of a TV set. Babies who watched 60 minutes of TV daily had developmental scores a third lower at 14 months than babies who were watching less TV. Although their developmental scores were still in the normal range, the difference may have been due to the fact that when children and parents are watching TV, they are missing the talking, playing and other communications that are important to learning and development. This new study, which appeared in the Aechives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, followed 259 lower-income families in New York, most of whom spoke Spanish as their primary language at home. Other studies of higher-income families have also come to the same conclusion: TV watching is not only non-educational, but it seems to slow down babies' development. But what about \\"good\\" TV, like Sesame Street? The researchers didn't find any difference when compared to non-educational programs designed for small children, like Spongebob SquarePants. Earlier research by some of the same scientists, most of whom are at New York University School of Medicine's Bellevue Hospital Centre, has found that parents whose children watch non-educational TV programs like Spongebob SquarePants spend less time reading to their children or teaching them. At this point, parents reading this will probably be astonished. TV is so often a parent's good friend, keeping children happily occupied so that the adults can cook dinner, answer the phone, or take a shower. But, clearly, this electronic babysitter is not an educational aid. It is best to make sure the babies are fast asleep if you have to watch TV. Question: We can infer from the passage that  _  .

Answer the above question based on the context below:  At the age of seventeen Lancaster passed his final school examinations and gained entrance to Lincoln College, Oxford, to study history. He persuaded his mother to allow him to leave Charterhouse at once, giving him several months between school and university, during which he enrolled on a course of life classes at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. In October 1926 he started at Oxford. There, as at Charterhouse, he found two camps in which some students chose to group themselves: the \\"hearties\\" presented themselves as aggressively heterosexual and anti-intellectual; the \\"aesthetes\\" had a largely homosexual membership. Lancaster followed his elder contemporary Kenneth Clark in being contentedly heterosexual but nonetheless one of the aesthetes, and he was accepted as a leading member of their set. He cultivated the image of an Edwardian dandy, with large moustache, a monocle and check suits, modelling his persona to a considerable degree on Beerbohm, whom he admired greatly. He also absorbed some characteristics of the Oxford don Maurice Bowra; Lancaster's friend James Lees-Milne commented, \\"Bowra's influence over Osbert was marked, to the extent that he adopted the guru's booming voice, explosive emphasis of certain words and phrases, and habit in conversation of regaling his audiences with rehearsed witticisms and gossip.\\" Lancaster's undergraduate set included Stephen Spender, Randolph Churchill, and most importantly John Betjeman, who became a close friend and lifelong influence.Lancaster tried rowing with the Oxford University Boat Club, but quickly discovered that he was no more suited to that than he had been to field games at school. He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), acted in supporting roles, designed programme covers, wrote, and choreographed. He contributed prose and drawings to Isis and Cherwell magazines, engaged in student pranks, staged an exhibition of his pictures, attended life classes, and became established as a major figure in the Oxonian social scene.

But the next night, Lilian is found to have died of a heart attack. The Liptons are surprised by the death because Lilian seemed so healthy. The Liptons are also surprised by Paul's cheerfulness so soon after his wife's death. Carol becomes suspicious and starts to investigate, even inventing an excuse to visit him. An urn she finds in Paul's apartment contradicts Paul's story that Lilian had been buried. Larry becomes frustrated with Carol, telling her she's \\"inventing a mystery\\". Carol sneaks into Paul's apartment while he's away and finds more telling signs. Helen's urn is missing, there are two tickets to Paris and hotel reservations with a woman named Helen Moss. Carol calls Ted (Alan Alda), a close friend who agrees with Carol's suspicions and urges her to keep snooping. When Paul returns unexpectedly, Carol hides under the bed and overhears Paul's conversation with a woman whom she suspects is Helen Moss. Later, Ted tracks down where Helen Moss lives, and with Carol and Larry, they follow her to a theater owned by Paul. They discover that Helen (Melanie Norris) is a young actress. The three eavesdrop on Paul and Helen talking about money. A few days later, Carol spots a woman who's a dead ringer for the supposedly dead Lilian House on a passing bus. Upon Larry's suggestion that Lilian has a twin, Ted investigates but finds Lilian has none. Larry and Carol trace this mystery \\"Lilian\\" to a hotel and, under the pretense of delivering a personal gift, they enter her hotel room, but find her lying dead on the bedroom floor. They call the police, who subsequently find no trace of the dead body. The Liptons search the room for clues. While leaving, they get trapped in the lift and accidentally stumble across Lilian's body inside the emergency exit panel. Upon exiting to the street, they spot Mr. House putting the body in the trunk of... Answer:","output":"In light of the complex and suspenseful plot of the movie involving Larry and Carol Lipton's investigation into the mysterious death of their neighbor Lilian House, and the subsequent discoveries revolving around Paul House, Helen Moss, and the seemingly alive Lilian, an intriguing question to generate about this movie could be: What motives and secrets does Paul House hold that lead to the elaborate series of events involving his wife Lilian's mysterious death, the involvement of Helen Moss, and the ultimate unearthing of both deception and potential criminal intent by the Liptons and their friend, Ted?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons (called \\"photoelectrons\\") from a surface when light is shone on it. It was first observed by Alexandre Edmond Becquerel in 1839, although credit is usually reserved for Heinrich Hertz, who published the first thorough investigation in 1887. Another particularly thorough investigation was published by Philipp Lenard in 1902. Einstein's 1905 paper discussing the effect in terms of light quanta would earn him the Nobel Prize in 1921, when his predictions had been confirmed by the experimental work of Robert Andrews Millikan. The Nobel committee awarded the prize for his work on the photo-electric effect, rather than relativity, both because of a bias against purely theoretical physics not grounded in discovery or experiment, and dissent amongst its members as to the actual proof that relativity was real. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Who published the first thorough investigation of the photosynthesis effect?","output":"The question asked is about the \\"photosynthesis effect,\\" which is a different topic than the photoelectric effect discussed in the provided information.

Please answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who abandoned a romance due to someone's father?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  From her Parkville jail cell, Vergie Winters watches the funeral procession of Senator John Shadwell and remembers her twenty-year past with him: The moment young lawyer John returns to Parkville from an extended honeymoon with his social climbing wife Laura, he visits Vergie, his former lover. After a passionate embrace, John explains to the youthful milliner that he had abandoned their romance because Vergie's father had told him that she was pregnant by laborer Hugo McQueen and would be forced to marry. Vergie then tells John that, to keep her from marrying John, Laura's father had paid her father 10,000 to tell him that devastating lie. Still deeply in love, John and Vergie continue to see each other, but when John starts to campaign for Congress, Preston, a political boss, informs Vergie that, if John is to receive his vital support, she must forego their affair. Although Vergie agrees to Preston's terms, John refuses to end the relationship and spends a long evening with her before the election.  After a victorious win, John moves to Washington, D.C. with Laura, Vergie bears his child under an assumed name. John then adopts the baby, named Joan, whom he claims is the child of a destitute family friend.  At the start of World War I, John returns to Parkville and once again resumes his affair with Vergie. When one of John's late night rendezvous is witnessed by a town gossip and reported to Mike Davey, John's only political enemy, Vergie's successful millinery shop is boycotted, and she is shunned by all but the local prostitutes. In addition, Davey hires Preston's son Barry to steal from Preston's home safe a page from a hotel register on which Vergie had written her assumed name.

Q: Article: The small coastal town of Broome, in northwest Australia, is a remote village in the vast countryside. There are no traffic jams and hardly any roads. There is only the massive Australian wild land, where some houses are 500 miles apart and some driveways are 50 miles long. There seem to be only two main sources of entertainment out here: the sunset at the beach and Sun Pictures. Sun Pictures is a very different movie theater:The seats are park benches and deck chairs, but you're also welcome to sit on the grass. It is the world's oldest outdoor movie garden. Sun Pictures was built in 1916 on the other side of the globe from Hollywood. All the big films were shipped here and the lonely country was amazed. Broome resident Pearl Hamaguchi has never traveled far from home. But in the Sun Pictures chairs, under the deep blue night sky, she has been almost everywhere. \\"And we came back excited about Gregory Peck,\\" she recalled. This is one of the few places left in the world where you can see two sets of stars at the same time-----one set in the sky, the other in the film. Each night, dozens of people from around the world line up at the old wooden stand, with no computer in sight, and buy their tickets to the latest films. Sun Pictures is also a museum, exhibiting projectors  that date back to the silent films, a portrait gallery of the famous people who never knew about this place---- even though they came here all the time. Every once in a while, I'm told, you might find a non-ticket holder in your seat. That's why it's always a good idea to shake out your chair to make sure there are no spiders or scorpions. \\"We've only had a couple of scorpion incidents but no one's been stung yet,\\" said Aaron Mestemaker, a tourist visiting from Michigan.

Hypothesis: Convento de Santa Clara housed nuns for decades. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis that Convento de Santa Clara housed nuns for decades is not directly entailed by the given premise, although it is plausible based on the context provided. The premise states the location and age of the Convento de Santa Clara, but it does not offer specific information about its history, purpose, or inhabitants. However, the name \\"Convento de Santa Clara\\" suggests that it may be associated with the religious order of Santa Clara or the Poor Clares, who are nuns. To determine whether the hypothesis is valid, more information needs to be gathered about the history and the purpose of this specific convent. It is reasonable to assume that the Convento de Santa Clara may have housed nuns, given its name and the fact that convents have traditionally housed religious communities of women. However, without further evidence or context, it would be inappropriate to claim that the hypothesis is directly entailed by the premise. A more thorough investigation of the Convento de Santa Clara's history could clarify its primary function and whether or not it housed nuns for extended periods. If historical records or other sources demonstrated that this convent indeed served as a residence for nuns, then the hypothesis would be more likely to be entailed by the premise.

The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.  - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling).  - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine.  - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland.  - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).  - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.  - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature.  - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\"  \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\"  \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives.  - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living.   - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs.  Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Anita McCambridge.","output":"Title: \\"The Rise of the Bulldogs\\" Genre: Sports Drama/Comedy Plot Summary: The unexpected passing of her estranged father leaves Anita McCambridge, a ruthless Wall Street executive, as the sole owner of a struggling ice hockey team, the Syracuse Bulldogs. Situated in a blue-collar town, the Bulldogs are known for their tough, no-nonsense gameplay and their loyal, devoted fanbase. As Anita is faced with the prospect of taking on this inherited responsibility, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery, finding her passion, and eventually learning that sports has the power to overcome personal differences and unite a community. Plot: Act One: Anita McCambridge (mid-30s, ambitious, and career-oriented) works as a Wall Street executive in New York City. One day, she receives news of her estranged father's death and discovers he has left her his primary asset - the Syracuse Bulldogs, an ice hockey team located in Syracuse, New York. Reluctant and inexperienced in managing a sports team, she visits the town to assess the situation, making her intentions clear that she plans to sell the team and return to New York. Upon arriving, Anita meets the team's head coach, Jack Donovon, a seasoned former player who has dedicated his life to the sport and the community. Jack's charisma and connection with both the players and the fans intrigue Anita. At the same time, the passionate fans and players are highly suspicious of Anita and her motives, worried that the sale will cause the team to relocate or disband altogether. Act Two: Tensions rise as rumors about the team's potential dismantling spread throughout the town, only adding to the pressure on the Bulldogs' performance in the ongoing season. Jack pleads with Anita to give the team a chance to prove their worth, promising to deliver results by the end of the season. Unconvinced but curious about the local fervor and attachment to the team, Anita agrees to give the team a trial run, postponing any decisions until the end of the season. Jack introduces Anita to individual players, local supporters, and the behind-the-scenes staff, exposing her to the passion, dreams, and obstacles faced by those involved with the team. During this time, Anita discovers her late father's passion for the team and his commitment to the community. She learns that he saw the Bulldogs as a beacon of hope and a symbol of strength for the town. Anita experiences transformative moments, as she realizes that her life in New York is devoid of the warmth and along the way, she starts to develop a strong bond with Jack. Act Three: With Jack and Anita’s joint efforts, the team starts to show signs of improvement, both in their gameplay and player unity. However, halfway into the season, an investor approaches Anita with a lucrative offer to sell the team, intending to relocate it to a larger market, leaving Anita with a difficult decision to make. As the Syracuse Bulldogs reach the finals in a nail-biting match, the entire town, including friends and families of the players, comes together to support the team. At the last moment, Anita has a change of heart and refuses the offer from the investor, choosing instead to uphold her father's legacy and the dreams of the community. Jack and the Bulldogs emerge victorious, and the players, fans, and town celebrate their win together. Epilogue: Inspired by her father's passion and commitment to the team, Anita takes a leave of absence from Wall Street to focus on the Syracuse Bulldogs full-time, utilizing her business acumen to ensure their success off the ice. She and Jack start working together to better understand and expand the team's potential, forming a strong partnership and further developing their romantic relationship. Anita's experiences in Syracuse reveal the profound impact sports can have on individuals and communities, bridging personal and cultural differences. \\"The Rise of the Bulldogs\\" is a story about the transformative power of sportsmanship, self-discovery, passion, and the importance of standing together in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[1]. yes; [2]. it is not possible to tell; [3]. no;","output":"Based on the given premise, we can infer that the hypothesis \\"The CEO and chairman of the board positions can be separated to eliminate conflicts in function\\" is likely to be true. Thus, the answer is [1]. Yes. The premise states that some participants believe that separating the roles of CEO and chairman of the board can help in recognizing their distinct functions and roles, as well as eliminating conflicts that may arise from overlapping responsibilities. It also acknowledges the differences between the two positions and takes these differences into account. Consequently, these participants essentially argue that by clearly delineating the responsibilities of each role, this separation would improve the overall functioning of the company. In general, the chairman of the board is known for overseeing the board's activities and focuses on corporate governance, while the CEO is responsible for managing the company's operations and implementing strategies. By separating these two roles, the chairman can focus on ensuring that the board is effectively carrying out its duties, which include monitoring the CEO's performance. Meanwhile, the CEO can prioritize aspects of the company's operations and strategy implementation without added pressures stemming from the need to deal with corporate governance and board-related concerns. Furthermore, separating the roles creates a system of checks and balances, ensuring that no single individual has too much power within an organization. This system is designed to help prevent disputes between executive management and the board, improving overall management and decision-making within the company. In conclusion, if the premise is assumed to be true and separation of the CEO and chairman of the board positions indeed recognizes the differences in their roles and eliminates conflicts in functions, we can support the hypothesis that the CEO and chairman of the board positions can be separated to eliminate conflicts in function. This separation could potentially result in better governance, more transparent decision-making processes, and improved overall functioning within a corporate setting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun in the winter of 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas \\"in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.\\" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that \\"perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer.\\" This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces,...

Visibly in pain, he begins dictating a confession into a Dictaphone for his friend and colleague, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), a brilliant claims adjuster. The story, told primarily in flashback, ensues. Neff first meets the alluring Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) during a routine house call to remind her husband (Tom Powers) that his automobile insurance policy is up for renewal. They flirt, until Phyllis asks how she could take out an accident policy on her husband's life without his knowledge. Neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and makes it clear he wants no part of it. However, he cannot get her out of his mind, and when Phyllis shows up at his own home, he cannot resist her any longer. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and devises a plan to make the murder of her husband appear to be an accidental fall from a train that will trigger the \\"double indemnity\\" clause and pay out twice the policy's face value.

A complication ensues when he meets a passenger named Jackson (Porter Hall) there, but he manages to get the man to leave. Neff then throws the crutches on the railway tracks, jumps off at a prearranged meeting spot with Phyllis, and drags Dietrichson's body onto the tracks by his crutches.

Judith Butler FBA (born February 24, 1956) is an American philosopher and gender theorist whose work has influenced political philosophy, ethics and the fields of third-wave feminist, queer and literary theory. Since 1993, she has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is now Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory. She is also the Hannah Arendt Chair at the European Graduate School. Butler is best known for her books Gender Trouble: Judith Butler was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a family of Hungarian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent. Most of her maternal grandmother's family perished in the Holocaust. As a child and teenager, she attended both Hebrew school and special classes on Jewish ethics, where she received her \\"first training in philosophy\\". Butler stated in a 2010 interview with Haaretz that she began the ethics classes at the age of 14 and that they were created as a form of punishment by her Hebrew school's Rabbi because she was \\"too talkative in class\\". Butler also stated that she was \\"thrilled\\" by the idea of these tutorials, and when asked what she wanted to study in these special sessions, she responded with three questions preoccupying her at the time: \\"Why was Spinoza excommunicated from the synagogue? Could German Idealism be held accountable for Nazism? And how was one to understand existential theology, including the work of Martin Buber?\\"  Butler attended Bennington College and then Yale University where she studied philosophy, receiving her B.A. in 1978 and her Ph.D. in 1984. She spent one academic year at Heidelberg University as a Fulbright-Scholar. She taught at Wesleyan University, George Washington University, and Johns Hopkins University before joining University of California, Berkeley, in 1993. In 2002 she held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam.

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the agreement in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, saying negotiators \\"fought for and achieved drastic reductions to the Trump/GOP plan,\\" including much less funding for the wall than Trump requested and a limit on the number of immigrants that can be...

Let's move all the terms containing 't' to the left-hand side of the equation. To do that, add 108 * t to both sides: -108 * t + 108 * t + 191 = 160 * t - 345 + 108 * t  This simplifies to: 191 = 268 * t - 345 Step 3: Move the constant term (i.e., the term without 't') to the right-hand side of the equation. Add 345 to both sides: 191 + 345 = 268 * t - 345 + 345 On simplifying, we get: 536 = 268 * t Step 4: Isolate the variable 't' by dividing both sides by 268: 536 / 268 = 268 * t / 268 On simplification, we get: 2 = t So, the value of 't' that satisfies the given equation is t = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In-line skating is a fun sport that everyone can enjoy. Follow these safety tips to keep skating safe and fun. Step 1: Gear up! Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \\"No skating\\" signs to make sure you can skate there. Question: In the step right after \\"Buckle up!\\" you should practice how to   _  .

Process:  - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the carbon dioxide is already cleaned happens, how will it affect lung is cleaned of all the carbon dioxide.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis poses an interesting question regarding the effects of a lung that has already been cleaned of carbon dioxide. To understand the possible consequences of this situation, it is essential to examine the respiratory process more closely and consider the role of carbon dioxide in maintaining a balanced internal environment for the body. The primary goal of the respiratory system is to facilitate the exchange of gases between the external environment and the internal body, specifically, to provide oxygen for cellular metabolism and eliminate carbon dioxide produced as a waste product. The process of respiration mainly occurs as follows: 1. Air, containing oxygen, enters the body through the mouth and nostrils and passes through the respiratory tract, including the pharynx, larynx, and trachea. 2. The inhaled air arrives at the lungs, where it further divides into bronchi, bronchioles, and finally, into tiny sacs called alveoli. These alveoli, which have a vast surface area, are responsible for facilitating gas exchange between the air and the bloodstream. 3. Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. At the same time, carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration diffuses from the blood into the alveoli, a process driven by the concentration gradient of both gases. 4. The now oxygen-rich blood is transported back to the heart and subsequently pumped throughout the body, providing oxygen to all cells to support metabolism and vital functions. 5. The air remaining in the lungs, which now has a higher concentration of carbon dioxide, is forced out during exhalation. This process removes carbon dioxide from the body and brings in fresh, oxygen-rich air during the next inhalation. If the lungs are already cleaned of all carbon dioxide, as in the perturbation hypothesis, a few potential direct and indirect effects could be observed: 1. Direct Effects: - Altered Regulation of Breathing: Normally, carbon dioxide levels in the blood strongly affect the respiratory centers in the brainstem, which regulate breathing rate and depth. An absence of carbon dioxide in the lungs could lead to irregular or shallow breathing, since the body relies on carbon dioxide buildup as a stimulus to breathe.    2. Indirect Effects: - Acid-Base Imbalance: Carbon dioxide is an essential metabolic waste product that helps regulate the body's acid-base balance. When carbon dioxide is removed from the body, it also reduces the levels of carbonic acid, which could lead to a potential imbalance in the body's pH, termed respiratory alkalosis.  - Oxygen Transport Disruption: Hemoglobin's ability to bind and release oxygen is influenced by the presence of carbon dioxide (known as the Bohr effect). Without carbon dioxide, oxygen transport could be affected, and cells might not receive the appropriate amount of oxygen they need to maintain normal metabolic functions. This condition could lead to decreased cellular energy production and impaired physiological processes. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis concerning the absence of carbon dioxide from the lungs would have both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process and overall homeostasis of the body. Understanding the interconnectedness of all physiological systems is critical when evaluating such hypothetical scenarios, as the effects could cascade throughout the body and result in a range of potential consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane.

Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air.

Write some highlights for the following article: Demonstrators clapped along to Soviet-era songs as dancers from Russia's Black Sea fleet entertained the masses at the center of Crimea's administrative capital Sunday. But it was more than just nostalgia for the old Soviet Union. With a controversial referendum over whether Crimea will remain part of Ukraine just a week away, it was a rallying cry for ethnic Russians gathered in Simferopol's Lenin Square. The large demonstration was the latest flashpoint as tensions simmer on the Crimean peninsula, which has become the epicenter of a battle for influence among Moscow, Kiev and the West since Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster last month. Pro-Russian forces have pushed into the Black Sea peninsula in a bloodless siege, prompting criticism from Western nations and Ukraine's interim government. At Sunday's rally, throngs of people waved Crimean and Russian flags. And they said they want one thing: a union with Russia. Because of language and history, one man at the rally told CNN, Russia and Crimea are already \\"brothers.\\" But not all Crimeans are convinced. Across town, beneath a statue of Ukraine's most celebrated poet, the crowd was much smaller, the mood much more somber. Asked what he thought about the possibility of Crimea becoming part of Russia, one demonstrator shook his head. \\"It will be very complicated because of economics, and a lot of different nations live here, not only Russians. ... Not all of the people want to be part of Russia,\\" he said. \\"It's kind of show. Putin's show.\\" The rally was peaceful. But elsewhere, in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, another Ukrainian rally came under attack by pro-Russian gangs who whipped and beat demonstrators. In Kiev, thousands of people gathered at a rally for peace at the central Independence Square, the cradle of the protests that ousted Yanukovych. The crowd shouted slogans such as \\"Glory for Ukraine\\" and \\"Putin go away\\" as representatives of different religions prayed for a solution to the crisis. Putin speaks with Merkel, Cameron. While the autonomous Ukrainian region was the scene of emotional demonstrations by both sides, Russian President Vladimir Putin defended the breakaway moves by the pro-Russian leaders of Crimea in conversations with two world leaders on Sunday,. In separate phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron, Putin underlined \\"steps being taken by Crimea's legitimate authorities ... being based on international law on behalf of the interests of the population there,\\" according to a Kremlin statement. Putin also said new Ukrainian authorities were doing nothing \\"to curb ultra-nationalist and radical forces committing outrages\\" in Kiev and other regions. The three leaders spoke amid tensions on the Black Sea peninsula that have escalated since the Moscow-backed regional parliament voted to leave Ukraine for Russia and announced a March 16 referendum to give Crimeans an opportunity to vote on the idea. Despite the differences of opinion over what is happening on the ground, the Kremlin statement said there was consensus on the need to de-escalate tensions and normalize the situation. It's unclear what could happen next in the tense standoff, but Sunday's phone conversations between Putin, Cameron and Merkel send one clear message, CNN analyst and Russian journalist Vladimir Pozner said. \\"I think it shows that President Putin is very worried by the situation. I think speculation that he's trying to rebuild the Soviet empire are way off base,\\" Pozner said. \\"I think he knows all too well the necessity of Russia having an international relationship with the West. ... My hope is, with all the escalations going on, that there's a real chance of finding some way out of this very dangerous situation.\\" Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, putting the two countries on a collision course over control of Crimea, which has longstanding ties to Russia and has thousands of Russian troops stationed there. Putin has said Russia has the right to protect Russians living in the former Soviet republic. Pro-Russian forces are now in de facto control of the region ahead of the referendum, which Kiev says is illegal. Washington has warned Moscow that any moves to annex Crimea would close the door to diplomacy. On Saturday, U.S. President Barack Obama rounded up world leaders to demand Russia \\"de-escalate the situation.\\" Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will fly to the United States this week to discuss the crisis in Crimea, as hostilities in the eastern European country's southern region intensify. Yatsenyuk is expected to arrive in the United States on Wednesday, a spokeswoman from his press office told CNN. The White House confirmed the visit and said the two will talk about the Russian military incursion and economic support for Ukraine. Referendum becomes focus. Putin last week secured permission from his parliament to use military force to protect Russian citizens in Ukraine. The move came within days after Yanukovych's flight from the country. Yanukovych was ousted after three months of protests against a decision to spurn a free trade deal with the European Union and turn toward closer ties with Moscow. A convoy of military vehicles, believed to be carrying Russian soldiers, traveled through Simferopol on Saturday, heading toward the border post at Armyansk, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense told CNN. Armyansk is one of the main access points into Crimea from the rest of Ukraine. Dozens of military observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe have tried to cross into Crimea for three days but have been refused entry by armed men. They did not attempt a crossing on Sunday. The referendum on whether the Crimean Peninsula should join Russia has become the focus of the Ukraine crisis. Yatsenyuk has called it \\"an illegitimate decision.\\" \\"If there is an annexation of Crimea, if there is a referendum that moves Crimea from Ukraine to Russia, we won't recognize it, nor will most of the world,\\" U.S. deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said on CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" on Sunday. \\"So I think you'd see, if there are further steps in the direction of annexing Crimea, a very strong, coordinated international response.\\" CNN's Claudia Rebaza, Arkady Irshenko, Azadeh Ansari and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","output":"- Demonstrators in Simferopol's Lenin Square rallied for Crimea to become part of Russia amid tensions leading up to a controversial referendum. - Ethnic Russians in Crimea express desire for union with Russia, citing shared language and history. - Not all Crimeans support the idea of joining Russia, with economic complications and diverse nationalities as concerns. - Pro-Russian forces took control of the Crimean peninsula in a bloodless siege, drawing criticism from Western nations and Ukraine's interim government. - Russian President Vladimir Putin defended the pro-Russian leaders of Crimea in phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron, citing international law and the interests of the population. - Despite differences in opinions on the ground, there was consensus on the need to de-escalate tensions and normalize the situation. - Moscow has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, creating a collision course over control of Crimea. - The upcoming referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia has become the focus of the ongoing crisis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In hard pines, on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"If you prefer not to have a light color wood like pine, you should look for wood species that offer darker tones, richer hues, and a greater contrast between the earlywood and latewood portions of the growth rings. These wood types not only bring a different aesthetic, but often possess distinct characteristics that might better fit your needs and preferences. Several darker-toned wood options include: 1. Walnut: Known for its rich, dark brown color and beautiful grain patterns, walnut is a popular choice for furniture, cabinetry, and flooring. It is relatively hard and resistant to wear, while still being easy to work with. 2. Mahogany: With its deep reddish-brown hue, mahogany has long been prized for its luxurious appearance and durability. It is often used for fine furniture, musical instruments, and interior detailing, as it is resistant to decay and showcases excellent workability. 3. Cherry: Displaying a reddish-brown color that darkens with age, cherry wood offers an attractive grain pattern and a smooth finish. It is a popular choice for cabinetry, flooring, and furniture and is renowned for its strength and resistance to decay. 4. Oak: Oak wood comes in two primary types—red oak and white oak—each characterized by noticeable contrasting growth rings. Red oak is lighter in color, while white oak boasts a darker, more amber hue. Both types are exceptionally strong, durable, and suitable for various applications, such as furniture, flooring, and cabinetry. 5. Teak: Famous for its golden brown color, tight grain pattern, and natural oils that protect against decay and pests, teak is a sought-after option for outdoor furniture, boatbuilding, and other applications exposed to the elements. 6. Rosewood: With a rich, dark red-brown shade and attractive grain patterns, rosewood is an exotic option often utilized for musical instruments, decorative veneers, and high-end furniture. Its highly-prized aesthetic is matched by its density and exceptional durability. 7. Wenge: This dark, chocolate-brown wood with contrasting grain is native to Africa. Wenge's unique appearance makes it popular for flooring, furniture, and paneling. However, it is relatively difficult to work with due to its hardness and brittleness. When choosing a darker wood, consider the specific application, desired aesthetics, and wood characteristics like hardness, density, workability, and resistance to decay or pests.

Read this: General Aguirre moved to the deserts of the southeastern portion of the state and defeated the French forces in Parral, led by Colonel Cottret. By the middle of 1866, the state of Chihuahua was declared free of enemy control; Parral was the last French stronghold within the state. On June 17, 1866, President Juárez arrived in Chihuahua City and remained in the capital until December 10, 1866. During his two years in the state of Chihuahua, President Juárez passed ordinances regarding the rights of adjudication of property and nationalized the property of the clergy. The distance of the French forces and their allies allowed the Ministry of War, led by General Negrete, to reorganize the state's national guard into the Patriotic Battalion of Chihuahua, which was deployed to fight in the battle of Matamoros, Tamaulipas against the French. After a series of major defeats and an escalating threat from Prussia, France began pulling troops out of Mexico in late 1866. Disillusioned with the liberal political views of Maximilian, the Mexican conservatives abandoned him, and in 1867 the last of the Emperor's forces were defeated. Maximilian was sentenced to death by a military court; despite national and international pleas for amnesty, Juárez refused to commute the sentence.

Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \\"corvée\\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \\"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolmaš writes that while the Ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage provided them with wealth and power. Laird writes that Tibetans eagerly sought Ming court invitations since the gifts the Tibetans received for bringing tribute were much greater in value than the latter. As for the Yongle Emperor's gifts to his Tibetan and Nepalese vassals such as silver wares, Buddha relics, utensils for Buddhist temples and religious ceremonies, and gowns and robes for monks, Tsai writes \\"in his effort to draw neighboring states to the Ming orbit so that he could bask in glory, the Yongle Emperor was quite willing to pay a small price\\". The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC lists the Tibetan tribute items as oxen, horses, camels, sheep, fur products, medical herbs, Tibetan incenses, thangkas (painted scrolls), and handicrafts; while the Ming awarded Tibetan tribute-bearers an equal value of gold, silver, satin and brocade, bolts of cloth, grains, and tea leaves.

Movie title: The Thing Movie plot: In the Antarctic, a Norwegian helicopter pursues an Alaskan Malamute to an American research station. Upon landing, the passenger accidentally drops a thermite charge, which destroys the helicopter and kills the pilot when he tries to retrieve it. The passenger pursues the dog, firing a rifle, until he is shot dead by Garry, the station commander. The Americans send a helicopter pilot, MacReady, and Dr. Copper to the Norwegian camp for answers, but they find only a charred ruin. Inside, they find a corpse with its throat and wrists slashed in the radio room. Outside, they discover the burned remains of a humanoid corpse with two faces, which they bring back along with some video tapes. Their biologist, Blair, performs an autopsy on the corpse, finding a normal set of human internal organs. Clark kennels the Malamute with the station's sled dogs; it soon metamorphoses and attacks them. When he hears the commotion, MacReady pulls the fire alarm, and Childs incinerates the creature. Blair performs another autopsy which leads him to believe the creature perfectly imitates other organisms. The Norwegians' records lead the Americans to a buried flying saucer that the station's geologist, Norris, hypothesizes is likely over 100,000 years old. Blair becomes increasingly paranoid and withdraws, calculating that if the alien escapes to a civilized area, all life on Earth will be assimilated within a few years. Fuchs tells MacReady that he is worried about Blair, and according to Blair's journal, the creature's \\"dead\\" remains are still active on a cellular level. The camp enacts safety measures designed to reduce risk of assimilation. The creature assimilates Bennings, but Windows catches him outside before his metamorphosis is complete and MacReady burns the creature before it can escape.

Question: What is the name of the doctor that Oliver persuades his wife to see? Title: Cat People Movie plot: Jane Randolph in the trailer for Cat People At the Central Park Zoo in New York City, Serbian-born fashion designer Irena Dubrovna makes sketches of a black panther. She catches the attention of marine engineer Oliver Reed, who strikes up a conversation. Irena invites him to her apartment for tea. As they walk away, one of Irena's discarded sketches is revealed as a panther impaled by a sword. At her apartment, Oliver is intrigued by a statue of a medieval warrior on horseback impaling a large cat with his sword. Irena informs Oliver that the figure is King John of Serbia and that the cat represents evil. According to legend, long ago the Christian residents of her home village gradually turned to witchcraft and devil worship after being enslaved by the Mameluks. When King John drove the Mameluks out and saw what the villagers had become, he had them killed. However, \\"the wisest and the most wicked\\" escaped into the mountains. Oliver buys her a kitten, but upon meeting her it hisses. Irena explains that \\"cats just don't like me\\" and suggests they go to the pet shop to exchange it, but when they enter the shop the animals go wild in her presence. The shopkeeper says that animals can sense things about people. It gradually becomes clear that Irena believes she is descended from the cat people of her village, and that she fears that she will transform into a panther if aroused to passion.

At the time of her birth, her parents had been living in Utah with her elder brother, Shane; her father was attending Brigham Young University. She is a first cousin once removed of actress Q'orianka Kilcher. Her father, originally from Alaska, was a Mormon, though the family stopped attending The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after her parents' divorce when she was eight years old. For a time, Kilcher lived in her car while traveling around the country doing street performances and small gigs, mainly in Southern California. She gained recognition by singing at The Inner Change Cafe and Java Joe's in San Diego; she would later make her debut record at Java Joe's when it was in Poway, where she had worked as a barista. Her friend Steve Poltz's band, The Rugburns, played the same venues. She later collaborated with Poltz on some of her songs, including \\"You Were Meant for Me\\". (He also appeared in the song's second, better-known video.) The Rugburns opened for Jewel on her Tiny Lights tour in 1997. Poltz appeared in Jewel's band on the Spirit World Tour 1999 playing guitar.  Kilcher was discovered by Inga Vainshtein in August 1993 when John Hogan, lead singer from the local San Diego band Rust, whom Vainshtein was managing, called to tell her about a girl surfer who sang at a local coffee shop on Thursdays. Vainshtein drove to The Inner Change with a representative from Atlantic Records, and after the show they called Danny Goldberg, the head of Atlantic Record's West Coast operations, and asked him to pay for her demo, since at the time she was living in a van and lacked the means to record any of her own music. Vainshtein, who at the time was working as a film executive at Paramount, eventually became her manager and was instrumental in creating a major bidding war that led to her deal with Atlantic Records. She continued to manage Jewel until the end of the first album cycle. Her debut album Pieces of You was released the eponym of Jewel, in 1995 when she was 21 years old. Recorded in a studio on singer Neil Young's ranch, it included Young's backing band, The Stray Gators, who played on his Harvest and Harvest Moon albums. Part of the album was recorded live at The Inner Change Cafe in San Diego, where she had risen to local fame. The album stayed on the Billboard 200 for two years, reaching number four at its peak. The album spawned the Top 10 hits \\"You Were Meant for Me\\", \\"Who Will Save Your Soul\\", and \\"Foolish Games\\". The album eventually sold over 12 million copies in the United States alone.  In the late 1990s, Mike Connell created an electronic mailing list for fans, known as \\"Everyday Angels\\". Although Jewel herself does not subscribe to this mailing list, she maintained communication with her EA fans. On July 18 and 19, 1996, she gave a two-day concert known as \\"JewelStock\\" at the Bearsville Theatre. Jewel allowed the concert to be taped, and fans circulated the concert without profit.

They even had to report the condition of the restroom to the health department, which is not a good thing. Also, they suggested people should go to a different restaurant nearby instead. That's why it's a negative review. The other option, 2). positive, is not correct because the review does not say anything good about the Denny's restaurant.

Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery.  Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it.  Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis.  The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic.  Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis.  In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back.  Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter.  All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis.  Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods.  Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

He may be a well-known music-lover having hosted high-profile shows on MTV, XFM and NME Radio. But Alex Zane reveals he more than happy to shun the masses of Ibiza's hard-partying tourists, booming beats and sprawling nightclubs to take a trip to the north of the island, which is littered with breath-taking beaches. The 35-year-old presenter says the Spanish island has 'two characters' explaining the tranquil villages and peaceful orange groves are just a bike-ride away and offer the opportunity to 'live like a local'. Read our Q and A with Alex to find out how he spends his time on the island. Many people are cautious of visiting Ibiza as they think it's all about clubbing and rowdy youngsters. But what else has the island got to offer? 'Ibiza is an island of two characters; the south which is devoted to the mega clubs and party-goers and the other, lesser known Northern side of the island, which is peaceful, tranquil and full of unspoilt beauty. Of course, the boundaries aren't as clear cut as this, but for every all-night DJ session there is an early morning sunrise at one of the many breath-taking little coves that litter the Island. The nightlife may have gained a reputation for the island amongst tourists, but it's this other side to Ibiza that the locals rave about. If you are one of the 50 per cent of Brits who, according to research by American Express, are after the authentic experience of 'living like a local', then the best way to explore this quieter side of the island is to hop on a bike and get off the beaten track to explore the many villages, peaceful orange groves and quaint little restaurants that tourists don't usually get to experience. I guarantee you won't hear a baseline the whole time you are there.' Alex Zane recommends escaping Ibiza's crowded clubbing areas and visiting the island's northern coast. Beaches such as Cala de Sant Vicent (pictured) can be found on the North East of Ibiza. Best restaurant? 'My favourite restaurant on the island is a little family owned place called Sabores Naturales in the centre of the small town of San Juan. It's got a quiet courtyard outside where you can just sit, relax, eat, drink and let time pass you by without a care. All the food is vegetarian and organic with fresh fruit juices and, in my opinion, the best homemade pizza on the island.' Best beach? 'Picking my favourite beach in Ibiza is a bit of a tricky one. If I did have to choose though, it would probably be Cala Xuclar. It felt like I was on a tropical beach without the long-haul flying. With great views and white sand, combined with a few fisherman's huts and a tiny kiosk serving food, it was the perfect place to escape from it all.' Great outdoors: Alex Zane loves the party side of Ibiza but also enjoys going out exploring. Best place to stay? 'If you are going in search of sunset bike rides and early morning strolls around the old towns, then I'd advise staying in any one of the boutique hotels in the north of the island, like the Hotel Hacienda Na Xamena, with its series of spa pools and waterfalls built into the cliff face. We stayed in Can Curreu and it's safe to say that that the view from the breakfast table made the early starts much better.' Your favourite thing about Ibiza and why? 'My favourite thing about Ibiza is discovering the hidden gems of the island. When you say to people you are heading on holiday to Ibiza, they immediately imagine rows of sun beds on the beaches and overcrowded bars blasting out music. Yet you only need to venture a little off the tourist trails and, even in peak season, you can find stunning, empty beaches and relaxing places to sit for a drink. Perhaps the island's reputation has meant less people visit Ibiza in search of a rejuvenating holiday. For whatever the reason, they're missing out.' The ultimate island guide: Alex produced his quick guide to what is great about Ibiza. What are your packing essentials? 'Packing light is the key if, like me, you enjoy moving around a lot. There's nothing worse than heaving a giant case jammed full of clothes to lug on and off various forms of transport. As long as you've got one smart outfit in there and the facilities to clean it you'll be fine. And if you don't have the facilities to clean it, you're probably not in a place you're going to need it in the first place.' Which destination is top of your wishlist? 'I'd like to explore more of South America. I've seen a lot of Brazil: Rio, Sao Paulo and up to Manaus and then deep into the Rain forest, but that's it. I'd really like to go further south to Argentina.' What is your earliest travel memory? 'Scotland. I remember being in Scotland so much as a kid. My mum often took myself and my brother to stay on the West Coast. We spent time on Skye, around Oban and Arisaig and then on the banks of Loch Awe. It is still one of my favourite places in the world to spend time… stunning scenery, wild weather and fascinating history.'

Gerald Howarth said Enoch Powell had been right to warn that mass movement of ‘non Christian’ migrants to Britain would cause problems. A veteran Tory MP has claimed controversial ‘rivers of blood’ MP Enoch Powell was right to warn against immigration. Gerald Howarth said the notorious Conservative MP had been correct to warn that mass movement of ‘non Christian’ migrants to Britain would cause problems. His comments were made in an email to a constituent about the Islamist 'Trojan Horse' plot in Birmingham to radicalise school children by taking over governing boards. In the leaked letter the former defence minister wrote: ‘Clearly, the arrival of so many people of non-Christian faith has presented a challenge, as so many of us, including the late Enoch Powell, warned decades ago. ‘Recent events have illustrated that some of these new arrivals have a very different ethos from traditional Christian schools and we are right to intervene to prevent them from teaching divisive ideology to children born here.’ Mr Howarth tonight confirmed that the leaked letter was 'entirely accurate' and reflected his views about the dangers of immigration. He told MailOnline: 'I feel very strongly about this and what's happening in Rotherham is devastating. It is decades of political correctness and it's allowed this disgusting abuse of children to take place. 'It's the Labour party who are responsible. The Labour party and the left.' He said England was now 'fighting back' against political correctness. He added: 'This is the United Kingdom for goodness sake - if you don't like it go and live somewhere else.' Sir Gerald said the problem with immigration was about 'numbers', which he said 'Enoch always said'. Enoch Powell’s notorious ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech was delivered in Birmingham in April 1968, sparking widespread condemnation. In the speech Mr Powell called for the ‘repatriation’ of non-white immigrants, claiming the racial mix in Britain would lead to city riots. Sir Gerald did not advocate repatriation in the leaked email to his constituent. Mr Powell was immediately sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet by the party’s then leader Edward Heath. Enoch Powell, the late Tory MP, sparked widespread anger after attacking migration in a 1968 speech on race relations. In 2007, the Tory candidate in the West Midlands seat of Halesowen, Nigel Hastilow, resigned after writing a newspaper article in which he said that Mr Powell was right. Mr Howarth is the MP for Aldershot and was a defence minister between 2010 and 2012. He was knighted in 2012. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Factors Unrelated to Driving Can Affect Car Insurance ARE you married or single? Have you been widowed or divorced? Is your credit history less than stellar? Your answers to those questions can affect the rates you pay for car insurance. Your driving record and habits factor into your premiums, of course. But many insurers also use a variety of other data, like your marital status and a version of your credit score, to set your rate. An analysis by the Consumer Federation of America found that online quotes from most companies were almost always higher for single, separated and divorced drivers than for married drivers. Notably, the study found that quotes for annual premiums for a young woman were an average of 14 percent higher if she was a widow, rather than married. Stephen Brobeck, the federation’s executive director, and another researcher examined quotes from six major insurers in 10 American cities based on a hypothetical 30-year-old single woman. (Differences in marital status probably hold for single men as well, Mr. Brobeck said.) For the analysis, the researchers obtained premium quotes from the auto insurers’ websites for the minimum liability coverage required by states. (All states but New Hampshire require liability coverage.) In seeking quotes, the study varied the driver’s marital status while keeping other characteristics constant. The test driver had no accidents or moving violations, held a high school diploma, worked as a bank teller and rented in a ZIP code with median household income of 30,000. Average quotes for a widowed driver obtained from five insurers — Geico, Farmers, Progressive, Nationwide and Liberty Mutual — were higher than for a married driver, ranging from 3 percent more (Nationwide) to 29 percent more (Geico). State Farm was the only insurer that did not quote higher premiums for a widow in any of the markets. The company’s quotes in a given city were the same, regardless of the driver’s marital status. Eric Hardgrove, a spokesman for Nationwide, said in an email statement that a number of factors affected a customer’s price. “Nationwide doesn’t have different prices based solely on whether a driver is widowed or married,” he said. He said that significant life events like a marriage or a death in the family “warrant a conversation with an insurance professional who can determine an individual’s specific insurance needs and advise on the appropriate coverage at the right price.” Geico did not immediately return emails and a phone message seeking comment. David Snyder, a spokesman for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, said that rather than showing a penalty applied to widows or other unmarried people, the analysis reflected that many insurers gave a discounted premium to married couples, because they tended to be more responsible and had a lower rate of filing claims. So if drivers are not married, they will not receive a quote with that discount. Also, Mr. Snyder said, punching information into a website to get a quote doesn’t reflect what occurs with actual customers. If a customer becomes widowed and later receives a premium increase, she can call her agent and explain that her spouse has died. “I don’t think there’s an agent out there that wouldn’t adjust the rate,” he said. Consumer Reports recently published an analysis that examined two billion insurance price quotes from 700 insurers and concluded that factors that don’t have to do with driving — like your credit history and whether you use store or bank credit cards — are increasingly used as criteria in setting rates. A single New Yorker, for instance, with merely “good” credit would pay an average of 255 more in annual premiums than someone with “excellent” credit, the analysis found. Mr. Snyder again said that insurers were basing their premium decisions on data that indicated higher risk: “It’s not people being judged,” he said. Rather, he said, “certain factors correlate to increased risk.” Mr. Brobeck argues that because auto insurance is state-mandated, insurance companies should be more transparent about how they set rates and should stick primarily to driving-related factors to set premiums. He cited as an example California, which has mandated that driving-related factors must be the primary criteria used to set premiums. (Three states, California, Hawaii and Massachusetts, prohibit insurers from using credit scores to set insurance rates.) Here are some questions to consider asking about auto insurance rates: ■ How can I increase my chances of getting a good auto rate? Because information in your credit report can affect your premium, you should check your report for possible errors and seek to have them corrected, said Margot Gilman, money editor at Consumer Reports. Using national bank credit cards rather than store-specific cards may help, she said, because insurers rank bank cards more highly. And, she said, if you receive notice of a rate increase, push back by contacting your insurer and asking for a lower premium. ■ Do I have recourse if my credit score harmed my premium? Many states allow consumers to ask their insurer for an “extraordinary life circumstances” exception, which would eliminate the use of their credit score as a factor in setting their premium if they are affected by a job loss, illness or other serious life event. Consumer Reports suggests seeking an exception, although it’s unclear how often such requests are granted. ■ Does it still make sense to shop around for insurance rates? Yes, said Ms. Gilman. But checking one or two different insurers isn’t enough. Most consumers check three insurers at the most, she said, “and falsely convince themselves that they’ve shopped around.” To get the best premium, she said, you should check rates “broadly and frequently” — and that means up to a dozen quotes. “It’s a pain in the neck,” she said. “But it’s worth it.” Make the most of your money.

Things like your marital status and credit history can change the rates you pay for car insurance. Some companies might charge more for single, separated, or divorced drivers. They use this extra information to help set your rates. For example, married couples might get a discount because they are seen as more responsible and have a lower chance of filing claims. Factors like your credit history can affect your rates too. So, it's important to make sure your credit report is accurate and to shop around for the best insurance rates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Oklahoma! is the first musical written by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and librettist Oscar Hammerstein II. The musical is based on Lynn Riggs' 1931 play, Green Grow the Lilacs. Set in Oklahoma Territory outside the town of Claremore in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry. A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fiancee, Ado Annie. The original production of Oklahoma! was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the New York Journal American pronounced the musical \\"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\\". In the New York Herald Tribune, Howard Barnes wrote, \\"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended.... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\\" Louis Kronenberger of PM opined that \\"Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in Oklahoma! call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\\"  In the New York Daily News, Burns Mantle declared that \\"Oklahoma! really is different - beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, Oklahoma! seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber's Show Boat\\". New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \\"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \\"Out of My Dreams\\" and \\"All Er Nuthin'\\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights.... They are spinetingling, out of this world.\\" In The New York Sun, Ward Morehouse commented that \\"Oklahoma! is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \\"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\\" Lorenz Hart himself \\"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in Sardi's restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\\"  The only negative review of the musical appeared in the New York Post: The critic wrote that \\"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\\", stating that the score consisted of \\"a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\\" She concluded that the show was \\"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What else is significant about the reception?","output":"The significant aspect of the reception of Oklahoma! can be found in the praise for its groundbreaking choreography from New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe, who stated that \\"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had.

Here's a detailed explanation of the translation: Ja - This is the direct translation of \\"Yes\\" in German. It has the same meaning in English. wir - It is the German word for \\"we.\\" In sentences, it is usually used before the verb. müssen - It is the German word for \\"have to.\\" In this context, it is used to express obligation or necessity. die Verantwortung - This term translates to \\"the responsibility\\" in English. In German, nouns are usually preceded by an article (der, die, das). Here, the gender of \\"Verantwortung\\" is feminine which is why we use \\"die.\\" für - It is the translation of \\"for.\\" unsere - This is the plural possessive pronoun used to denote \\"our.\\" In German, possessive pronouns change depending on the gender and number of the noun they're associated with. As \\"Misserfolge\\" is plural, we use \\"unsere\\". vielen Misserfolge - This translates to \\"many failures\\". Here, \\"vielen\\" is the adjective modifying the noun \\"Misserfolge\\" to illustrate multiple instances of failure.  übernehmen - It means \\"assume or take.\\" It's the verb used here to express the action of taking responsibility. aber - It is the exact translation of \\"but\\" in German, a coordinating conjunction used to connect two clauses or ideas. wir haben - It translates directly to \\"we have.\\" Just like in English, it's a verb phrase present in the sentence. nicht - It means \\"not.\\" It's used here to negate the verb, expressing the idea of not acting. alleine - It translates to \\"alone.\\" It is used here to denote action that was not done singularly or independently. gehandelt - It is the past participle form of the verb \\"handeln,\\" which means \\"to act.\\" In German, the past participle is often used at the end of a sentence to express past actions. So, piecing it all together, the sentence \\"Ja, wir müssen die Verantwortung für unsere vielen Misserfolge übernehmen, aber wir haben nicht alleine gehandelt.\\" translates in English as \\"Yes, we have to take responsibility for our many failures, but we did not act alone.\\" It carries the same context and sentiment from English to German."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're shown a three-part story, with a beginning, middle, and ending.

He hears story pitches from screenwriters and decides which have the potential to be made into films, green-lighting only 12 out of 50,000 submissions every year. His job is endangered when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death-threatening postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected.Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill lurks around Kahane's home and is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi), whom he watches while talking to her on the phone, that Kahane is at a showing of 'The Bicycle Thief'. Mill goes to the theater, pretending to recognize Kahane in the lobby after the film, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar and have some drinks. Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mills offer; he calls Mill a liar, pointing out that he knows Mill didn't really go to the theater to see 'The Bicycle Thief' because Kahane saw Mill wander in late and only catch the last five minutes of it, and denies responsibility for sending Mill the postcards. Kahane continues goading Mill about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot the two men fight. Mill loses his balance and falls, and feeling threatened, kills Kahane, then makes the death look like a robbery gone wrong.The next day, Mill receives another postcard. Mill attends Kahanes funeral and gets along with June; she knows none of the other mourners.

I lost the grip of the fencing wire and the pliers smacked me in the mouth. This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.

The band, led by Anthony Green, consists of former members from Saosin, This Day Forward, and Taken. Circa Survive quickly made a name for themselves in the indie music scene in little over two years with their 2005 debut album, Juturna, and second album, On Letting Go, released in 2007. Both albums were released on Equal Vision Records. Juturna, Circa Survive's first album, was released on April 19, 2005, in the United States and on January 31, 2006, in Japan on Equal Vision Records. It had been initially announced via the band's MySpace page in November 2004. Details as to its sound remained vague, although the band stated they would keep their fans posted via their website, MySpace page, PureVolume page, and YouTube page. Shortly before its official release, the album was posted on their MySpace page in its entirety. Juturna peaked at #183 on the Billboard 200. The album was produced by Brian McTernan at Salad Days Studios in Baltimore.  The band drew inspiration for the album from House of Leaves and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. During an online Q&A session on April 20, 2010, Brendan dismissed the claim that Juturna was a concept album based on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but did say that there is an underlying concept. That concept is speculated by fans to be vaguely about human memories. \\"Oh, Hello\\" exemplifies this with its lyrics. The decision to call the album's bonus track that appears after \\"Meet Me In Montauk\\" and the silence that follows it at 8:56, \\"House of Leaves\\" was more or less a joint one by the band and their fans. Various members of the band have stated that they have read at least some portion of the book over the years since its 2000 release.  The album's sound is characterized by its prominent utilization of effects-laden, dual guitar melodies over polyrythmic percussion. The guitarists' approach to songwriting takes on characteristics of jazz and shoegaze music. The album has since gone on to be considered massively influential to the post-hardcore community. Members of the band have recently recognized King Crimson, Bjork, Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor as influences on album's sound. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: was that album successful","output":"While I cannot directly quote an article, I can provide you with information based on the context provided. Juturna, Circa Survive's debut album, found success in the indie music scene. It peaked at #183 on the Billboard 200 and has been considered influential in the post-hardcore community. The band also gained recognition and built a fanbase through their online presence via MySpace, PureVolume, and YouTube. So, while it may not have reached mainstream commercial success, it was certainly successful within its genre and in creating a strong foundation for Circa Survive's career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

News article: GOING OUT GUIDE - NYTimes.com The new year is under way, the tinsel has come down and New Yorkers have returned to the long winter period of nonfestivity that is January. Instead of the time when every family was its own going-out center for the holidays, entertainment has reverted to the zones where it is a year-round staple. One of the biggest of these Manhattan playgrounds is Greenwich Village, where the small nightclub, the checker-and-chess emporium, the coffeehouse, the art gallery flour ish in season and out. Monday is not Greenwich Village's liveliest night, particularly after the New Year weekend, but it is never a dark night; one can always find the spark of life, the joyous note, the bubbling spirit in the Village. Tonight, for instance, there is life at the Horn of Plenty, 91 Charles Street, at Bleecker. This is a restaurant with one of those deceptive exteriors that mask a lavish interior, several rooms whose main decor consists of plants and other greenery. There is a winding staircase down to the main restaurant, while a back room has the feel of a greenhouse. Off to one side is a handsome bar and next to that is the spacious music room. In the music room, the spark that ignites tonight and every night through Saturday from 6:30 to 8 P.M. is Blossom Dearie. Miss Dearie is pianist and singer and has made her mark over the last 30 years, having her performing roots in the late 1940's, days when she played piano and moved with the crowd at Gil Evans's basement apartment, along with Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, John Lewis, Lee Konitz and Gerry Mulligan. Miss Dearie, who has described her performances as ranging from ''the meticulous to the sublime,'' sings songs written by herself and by others, new numbers like ''I Have a Feeling I've Been Here Before'' by Roger Kellaway and Marilyn and Alan Bergman and three new ones she has written with Jack Segal. Not to mention her performing staples such as ''Peel Me a Grape,'' ''Sophisticated Lady'' and ''I'm Hip.'' There is a 5 cover, plus a two-drink minimum. The restaurant works from 5 P.M., the bar from 4 to 11 P.M. Reservations: 242-0636. NEARBY Continue your wanderings in the Village, in the general latitudes of Bleecker Street and you will come to the Duplex, 55 Grove Street, off Seventh Avenue South (255-5438). The Duplex is another Village cornerstone, a place where, at least figuratively, you can take your shoes off. It is homey and chatty and, downstairs, Villagers sit and perhaps even intrude on each other's conversation, but amiably. Upstairs is the showroom, where the schedule is in effect just about every night. Tonight at 8 P.M., you can hear a singer, Deborah Unger. At 10 P.M., a more ambitious production: Lynda Rodolitz, who gives out with songs and humor. She will be abetted by Sande Campbell and Andy Gale. There is a 4 cover in this drinks-only emporium. Drinks, from 2 up. LUNCH BREAK The Quaigh Theater, one flight up in the Hotel Diplomat, 108 West 43d Street (221-9088), offers, in addition to its normal nighttime theater presentations, the only persisting noon-hour theater in the city. The Quaigh has a far-flung relationship with Lafayette University in Louisiana. Each year, eight or so plays by the university's playwriting group are selected and given one performance each by Quaigh. This year, Quaigh so liked one of the offerings that it is running it for two weeks, Monday through Friday this week and next at 12:15 P.M. The play is ''Snuff Flick,'' by John Fiero, professor of English at the university. It is farce about a young woman getting a test on a movie set only to find that the lead actor has just died; the farce is about how the deceased is made to give a smashing performance. Admission by donation; 2 is suggested; over-65's, students and members of Actors' Equity free.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: Blessed with children as well as a career outside the home, working mums may seem to have it all. But actually they suffer a double guilt burden – that they are bad mothers because they work and bad employees because they have a family, a study shows. Researchers found that working mothers agonised more about their job outside the office than fathers and had more negative thoughts about their family while at work. Guilt: Mother-of-four Victoria Beckham (with husband David and sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn) admitted to Vogue last year that she feels 'guilty' every time she goes out to work. Both parents think about their. families, but only for mothers is this type of thought associated with. increased stress and negative emotions. Shira. Offer, an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology and. Anthropology at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, studied mental labour in. working parents in pressurised jobs. She. defines the term as thoughts and concerns that can impair performance,. make it difficult to focus on tasks, and even hurt our sleep. The. study, presented to the American Sociological Association, relies on data. from the 500 Family Study, which investigates how. middle-class families balance family and work experiences. The. study looked at 402 American mothers and 291 fathers in dual-earner. families who completed a survey and a time and emotions diary. Asst. Professor Offer found that working mothers engaged in mental labour in about. one fourth of their waking time. Working fathers spent one fifth of their working time engaged in it. This amounts to approximately 29 and 24 hours per week of mental labour for mothers and fathers, respectively. Working guilt: Sarah Jessica Parker starred in the film 'I Don't Know How She Does It', playing ever-juggling working mother Kate Reddy. However,. mothers and fathers both spent about 30 percent of the time they were. engaged in mental labour thinking about family matters. Last year, Victoria Beckham spoke of her guilt of going out to work. Mrs Beckham - mother to Brooklyn, 14, Romeo, 11, Cruz, eight, and Harper, two, - admitted balancing her parenting duties with managing her clothing empire leaves her feeling 'constantly guilty'. Speaking at London's Vogue Festival, the 39-year-old, said: 'I think you feel so torn, don't you? But I've got great people who handle my schedule and everything does revolve around the children.' Commenting on her research, Asst. Professor Offer said: 'What my research actually shows is that gender differences in. mental labour are more a matter of quality than quantity. 'I assume that because mothers. bear the major responsibility for childcare and family life, when they. think about family matters, they tend to think about the less pleasant. aspects of it and are more likely to be worried.' Asst. Prof Offer added: 'We know that mothers are the ones who usually adjust. their work schedule to meet family demands, such as staying home with a. sick child. 'Desperate to be with her': Daybreak presenter Lorraine Kelly said last year that she 'suffered terribly from working mother guilt' 'Therefore,. mothers may feel that they do not devote enough time to their job and. have to ‘catch up,’ and, as a result, they are easily preoccupied with. job-related matters outside the workplace. 'This illustrates the double burden, the pressure to be \\"good\\" mothers and \\"good\\" workers, that working mums experience. 'I thought that highly educated fathers holding professional and managerial positions would often be preoccupied with job matters when doing things such as housework or during their free time. 'It appears, however, that fathers are quite adept at leaving their work concerns behind and are better able to draw boundaries between work and home. 'I believe that fathers can afford to do that because someone else, namely their spouse, assumes the major responsibility for the household and childcare.' She added: 'It is true that fathers today are more involved in childrearing and do more housework than in previous generations, but the major responsibility for the domestic realm continues to disproportionately fall on mothers’ shoulders and this has to change.' Highlights:","output":"1. Working moms have a double guilt burden - they feel like bad moms when they work, and bad employees when they have a family. 2. Researchers found that working moms worry more about their jobs outside the office than dads and have more negative thoughts about their family while at work. 3. Moms and dads spend about the same amount of time thinking about family, but for moms, it causes more stress and negative emotions. 4. Moms are usually the ones who adjust their work schedules to meet family needs and may feel that they don't give enough time to their jobs. 5. The responsibility for the family and household still falls mainly on moms' shoulders, and this needs to change for things to be more balanced between parents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Once you've taught your fish how to swim through hoops, they should be able to swim through and around anything with some guidance. Be patient when teaching your fish how to swim through an obstacle course, as it may take some time. Your fish will most likely follow your finger around once it has mastered that trick, so lead your fish through its obstacle course. Start with simple obstacle courses, and make them harder once your fish starts to master the obstacles. Use a treat on a string or a hood to lead your fish around instead of your finger. If you want your fish to follow you all around the tank, it may be hard for you to use your finger. Stick a treat on a hook, stick, or string and move it around the course so that the fish follows it. Make sure the fish doesn't get the treat until it's finished the course. Just like all the other tricks, positive reinforcement will help train your fish quickly. Give them a treat every time they complete the obstacle course. If you've had the treat on a hook, make sure to remove it from the hook before feeding it to the fish.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  News of Knut and his life at the zoo was still being reported internationally in late 2007. Knut's restricted diet, intended to curtail the natural weight gain necessary to survive harsh winters, made headlines outside of Germany.  His daily meals were reduced in number from four to three, and treats, such as croissants, which were favored by the young polar bear, were restricted.  After he hurt his foot while slipping on a wet rock in his enclosure a month later in September, there was an outpouring of concern and support from fans worldwide.In November 2007 and weighing over 90 kg (198 lb), Knut was deemed too dangerous for close handling and his interaction with human handlers was further diminished. The celebration of the cub's first birthday, which was attended by hundreds of children, was broadcast live on German television. The national mint also issued 25,000 special commemorative silver coins to mark his birthday.  Knut's role at the Berlin Zoo was to have included his becoming an \\"attractive stud\\" for other zoos in order to help preserve his species.

Here is an article: Updated MAY 04, 2014 3:12a ET After waiting 20 years to meet in the playoffs, the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks provided an overtime thriller in the opening tussle for Southern California supremacy. Marian Gaborik scored with seven seconds left in regulation to force overtime, and then scored 12:07 into the extra period to lift the Kings to a 3-2 victory Saturday night. Wresting home-ice advantage from the Ducks comes after the Kings staged a memorable comeback against San Jose, becoming the fourth NHL team to win a best-of-seven series after losing the first three games. \\"It was awesome. Really, it was what you expect,\\" Kings coach Darryl Sutter said. \\"It was a physical game. I think the crowd really responded to that.\\" Gaborik redirected Anze Kopitar's shot past Jonas Hiller for the winner before being mobbed in the corner by his teammates. \\"We did a good job on the forecheck,\\" Gaborik said. \\"The puck got to Kopi, he saw me driving to the net, and made a nice play. I just tried to tip it in.\\" Gaborik \\"is a big reason that we won the first round, and if he hadn't finished some of those opportunities it would have only gone six,\\" Sutter said. \\"If you look at both those goals, those are classic goals. You got to go to the net to score in the playoffs. \\"Doesn't matter if we pull the goalie, still got to go to the net. Not many guys can score those goals, but you still got to go to the net.\\" Hiller said the Kings \\"suddenly had a 2-on-1 out of nowhere. It was a shot-pass that went off the post and off my back and in. It's too bad. We had a couple chances in OT to finish it, but at the end it's still a 1-0 series. We need to focus on the next game and learn from this. We have room for improvement.\\" The Ducks and their fans -- who got to chant \\"Beat LA!\\" for the first time in the postseason -- appeared poised for a win after 43-year-old Teemu Selanne beat Jonathan Quick between the pads for a go-ahead goal with 11:52 to play in regulation. It was the first goal and fourth point of the playoffs for the Finnish Flash, who plans to retire at season's end. But the Kings pulled Quick for a sixth attacker with 1:22 left. In the closing seconds, Mike Richards took a shot from along the left boards, and Gaborik wristed the rebound past Hiller, who slumped in the net after giving up the tying goal. \\"They just threw it at the net,\\" Hiller said. \\"I thought I got a piece of it, but it got up in the air and he batted it out of the air back door. We weren't strong enough. We were too passive there.\\" Gaborik also had an assist on L.A.'s first goal of the night. Quick, who led the Kings to their only Stanley Cup championship two years ago, came up big several times in overtime. Even when he didn't, the Kings held off the Ducks. Quick got out of position during one wild scramble and defenseman Alec Martinez jumped into the net until Quick recovered. \\"Unbelievable. It was a little chaotic. Probably owe him dinner there,\\" Quick said. Their rinks just 30 miles apart, the Kings and Ducks have played each other 117 times in the regular season since Anaheim entered the NHL as a Disney-backed expansion franchise in 1993. They even met at Dodger Stadium in January, with the Ducks winning 3-0. But never in the playoffs, until Saturday night in Orange County. Game 2 is Monday night at Anaheim. The Ducks advanced after beating Dallas in overtime in Game 6 of their opening series. Martinez scored his first goal of the playoffs on a power play 9:04 into the game, beating Hiller on the glove side with a backhander after taking a pass from Gaborik from behind the net. Nick Bonino was in the penalty box for hooking. Anaheim's Matt Belesky tied it less than three minutes later after a beauty of an assist by Ryan Getzlaf. Getzlaf skated into the Kings zone and behind the net, drawing Quick out of the crease. He passed to Belesky in the slot, who put home a wrister before Quick could get back into position. It was Belesky's second goal of the playoffs. Getzlaf, who also assisted on Selanne's goal, has nine points in the playoffs. Hiller, a veteran who came in and saved Game 6 against Dallas -- and beat the Kings at Dodger Stadium -- got the start over 24-year-old Frederik Andersen.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What did Reznor think he should have just written himself?  A remix album, titled Year Zero Remixed, was released in November 2007. Due to the expiration of his contract with Interscope Records, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website.  Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is \\"still churning along\\", and that he had begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic. When asked about the miniseries during an \\"Ask Me Anything\\" session on Reddit on November 13, 2012, Reznor said it was \\"currently in a holding state\\" and explained, \\"We [Reznor and Sheridan] didn't find the right match with a writer, and really have been avoiding doing what we should have done from the beginning: write it ourselves.

However, they do ultimately convey the same meaning, just expressed differently. Both sentences provide information about the location of Suq Al Lail, that it is a neighborhood in Mecca, which is situated in western Saudi Arabia within the Makkah Province.  The first sentence:  \\"Suq Al Lail is a neighborhood of Mecca in Makkah Province, in western Saudi Arabia.\\" In this sentence, the information is presented by first stating that Suq Al Lail is a neighborhood of Mecca, followed by its placement within Makkah Province. Lastly, it informs us that the province is located in western Saudi Arabia. The structure of the sentence is more linear, moving from the specific neighborhood through the geographical context (province) to the wider location (Saudi Arabia). The second sentence:  \\"Suq Al Lail is a neighborhood of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, in the western province of Makkah.\\" This sentence conveys the same meaning but structures the information differently. It first states that Suq Al Lail is a neighborhood in Mecca and immediately places it within the context of Saudi Arabia. Then, it specifies that the province of Makkah is the western province in which Mecca is located. This sentence has a slightly different flow, presenting a broader context first (Saudi Arabia) before specifying the province (Makkah).

Paragraph: (CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

The output should be a list of integers with the same length as the number of lists in the input list. If there are no even numbers in an inner list you should output 0 for that list. Problem:[[-6, 34], [-5, 2, -32], [-49, -30, -44, 41, 5], [-48, -16], [39, -39], [-10, 18, -7, -31], [-27, 10, -24], [30, -12, 11, 41], [12, -37], [45, -28, 29, 46, 29]] Solution:","output":"Part #1: Given a list, of lists, of integers. Usage: [[-6, 34], [-5, 2, -32], [-49, -30, -44, 41, 5]]. Each element of this list is another list, which contains integers. Part #2: For every inner list contained in the input list. Usage: For the input list above, there are 3 inner lists: [-6, 34], [-5, 2, -32], and [-49, -30, -44, 41, 5]. You will perform some operation on each inner list. Part #3: Multiply every even number in that list. Usage: In the first inner list [-6, 34], the even numbers are -6 and 34. Multiplying these two numbers gives -204. Part #4: The output should be a list of integers. Usage: After processing every inner list, the result should be combined into a single list that contains integers. For example, [-204, 64, -1320]. Part #5: Same length as the number of lists in the input list. Usage: If the input list has 3 inner lists, the output list should also have 3 integers. Example: [-204, 64, -1320]. Part #6: If there are no even numbers in an inner list, output 0 for that list. Usage: In the input list [[3, 5, 7], [-6, 34]], the first inner list [3, 5, 7] does not have any even numbers, so the output for that list is 0. The result would be [0, -204]."},{"instruction":"Here's a question: After the sun has risen what happens at the end of the day?

Dhanusha, Nepal (CNN)At Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport, hundreds of migrant workers line up daily at the immigration counters, clutching newly printed passports and boarding passes. Many of them, though, are clueless as to where they're headed.  As a frequent traveler to the country, I've been approached many times by these men, asking me to help fill out their departure forms.  Usually, when I ask what country they're traveling to, I get the same answer: \\"I'm not sure.\\"  They seem weary and lost but still hopeful that they can make their lives better.  This time, however, I'm at the airport to follow up on the repatriation of the most unfortunate of these migrant workers -- far too many of them make the return journey in caskets.  Almost every day, the remains of three or four workers arrive back in Nepal from the Middle East, according to Bhola Prasad Siwakoti, the secretary of the Nepalese Ministry of Labor and Manpower. Every other day, at least one dead body arrives from Qatar, he said.  \\"Nepali migrant workers have the lowest per capita income in Qatar,\\" says Suryanath Mishra, who served as ambassador to Qatar from 2007 to 2012. \\"They get exploited the most out of all the migrant workers.\\"  He cites lack of education and technical skills as the main causes.  We are waiting for the body of Kishun Das, who left Nepal for Qatar only eight months ago. The 38-year old was his family's breadwinner and the father of five children.  His younger brother, Bishun, is at the airport to receive the body. He also works in Qatar and is in Nepal on leave. I ask him why he's alone.  1. How many migrant workers line up at the counters? 2.

More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no.

Sentence from a movie review: infrequently breathtaking  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the given sentence from a movie review, which says \\"infrequently breathtaking,\\" it is difficult to conclude whether the movie was viewed positively or negatively without more context. The term \\"breathtaking\\" implies that there were impressive or stunning aspects of the movie, such as its visuals, cinematography, acting, or other elements. However, the use of \\"infrequently\\" suggests that these moments of breathtaking wonder were not consistently present throughout the film. In some cases, the reviewer might have appreciated those sporadic extraordinary moments, seeing them as interesting highlights that stood out amid an otherwise mediocre or dull film. In such a scenario, the movie could be seen as somewhat positively by the reviewer because of its moments of greatness. This might encourage the audience to watch the movie for these specific thrilling segments, even if they have to tolerate other less engaging parts. On the other hand, the reviewer might have felt disappointed that these occasional breathtaking points weren't enough to elevate the overall quality of the movie. They may have expected more consistent brilliance and found it lacking, which would lead them to view the film negatively. For example, the movie may have failed to meet the expectations set by its promotional materials, talent involved, or source material. In this case, the infrequency of such breathtaking moments may not be sufficient to compensate for the underwhelming aspects of the film. Ultimately, it is not possible to determine whether this movie was considered positively or negatively based solely on the sentence provided. Additional context, such as more information from the review or an understanding of the reviewer's preferences, would be necessary to make a more accurate judgment about their perception of the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Good app\\" Answer:","output":"Based on the brevity of the review, it is challenging to assign an accurate star rating. However, we can analyze the given information and deduce a general rating. Considering the use of the word \\"good,\\" which conveys a positive sentiment, we can establish that the review is favorable. Consequently, we can assert that the rating should be at least average or higher. This would translate to a rating of three stars (★★★) or more. To arrive at a better understanding, a detailed analysis could be done by comparing the given review to other reviews that have similar wording and their respective star ratings. For instance, if a majority of reviews containing the word \\"good\\" have a 4-star rating, then this review would likely fall into that range. Nonetheless, one must proceed with caution in drawing a definitive conclusion from this single-word review. A more accurate rating determination would necessitate additional context and information about the user's experience with the app. Taking these factors into account, it can be estimated that the star rating for this review likely falls between ★★★ (average) and ★★★★ (above average).

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - A pub, or public house, is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, which traditionally include beer, ale and other brewed alcoholic drinks. It is a relaxed, social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British culture, Irish culture, New Zealand culture and Australian culture. In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community. In his 17th century diary Samuel Pepys described the pub as \\"the heart of England.\\"  - Samuel Pepys (; 23 February 1633  26 May 1703) was an administrator of the navy of England and Member of Parliament who is most famous for the diary that he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy.  - Introduction. An award is something given to a person, a group of people, or an organization to recognize their excellence in a certain field; a certificate of excellence. Awards are often signified by trophies, titles, certificates, commemorative plaques, medals, badges, pins, or ribbons. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient; for example, the Nobel Prize for contributions to society or the Pulitzer Prize for literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize of excellence.  - A resource is a source or supply from which benefit is produced. Resources are two types based upon their availability they are renewable and non renewable resource s.Typically resources are materials, energy, services, staff, knowledge, or other assets that are transformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made unavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being. From a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. From a broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource).  - Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to \\"lead\\" or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. The literature debates various viewpoints: contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) US vs. European approaches. US academic environments define leadership as \\"a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task\\". Leadership seen from a European and non-academic perspective encompasses a view of a leader who can be moved not only by communitarian goals but also by the search for personal power.  - In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal utility).   - A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \\"dive bars\\", to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a \\"pub\\", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin \\"taberna\\" and the Greek \\"\\"/taverna.  - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).  - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism.  - The National Pub of the Year is an annual competition held by CAMRA in February that finds the best pub in the UK . Established in 1988 , the competition helps to highlight quality pubs around the UK that are worth seeking out and visiting . Each year , each local CAMRA branch nominates one pub in their area to be entered . These 200 pubs then go through to the regional competition , which then whittles down to 4 pubs to go to the national final . The pubs in the national final are evaluated on : Quality of the Real Ales served Value for money Atmosphere Interior decoration Customer service and welcome  - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.  - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.  - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game).

General Dix Hauser Answer:","output":"Title: \\"Dix Hauser: A Brawl to Remember\\" Plot Summary: In a small, quiet Midwestern town, General Dix Hauser, a battle-hardened military veteran now leading a reclusive life, finds himself drawn to a local dive bar, \\"Benny's,\\" as his sanctuary where he tries to escape from the ghosts of his past. Little does he know that his presence at Benny's will spark a chain of events that will change the whole town's demeanor and earn him both allies and enemies that he never could have expected. Act 1: The movie begins by introducing General Dix Hauser as an enigmatic and silent regular patron at Benny's bar. The bar is seen as a melting pot, inhabited by people from various walks of life, each escaping their troubles with a drink. Hauser himself is a solitary figure who has shut himself off from the world, haunted by memories of his past military missions and personal losses. There he finds solace in the company of Jenny, the warmhearted bartender who seems to be the only person in town who understands him. One fateful evening, a group of rowdy out-of-town bikers arrives at Benny's, led by a cunning and ruthless man named Cash. As the night progresses, Cash and his gang become increasingly aggressive and confrontational, harassing the bar's regular customers, including Hauser. Unable to bear the sight of innocent people struggling, Hauser decides to intervene, sparking a huge bar fight. Act 2: The brawl results in serious damage to the bar and several injuries, leaving Benny's as the talk of the town. Cash swears revenge on Hauser for humiliating him in front of his gang and framing him for the brawl. Simultaneously, he plots to take over the town's criminal underbelly, setting up illegal operations ranging from drug trafficking to illegal betting rings. Slowly, tension builds up in the town among its citizens as their once peaceful and friendly community descends into darkness. Meanwhile, Hauser's actions earn him the admiration of many townspeople, with some taking a stand with him against Cash's criminal activities. Among them is a group of former soldiers who served alongside Hauser, who are galvanized to take a stand with their former leader, seeing in him a chance to forge a better future for their town. Together, they form a ragtag militia with the aim of stopping Cash's evil plans. Act 3: The climax of the film sees Hauser and his loyal band confront Cash and his gang in a final battle to save the town and the people they care for. The action-packed showdown takes place in a cat-and-mouse game across several iconic locations of the town, ending back at Benny's, the place where it all began. In the end, it is a battle-hardened Hauser who manages to defeat Cash, finally coming to terms with his own demons long enough to put his past behind him and use his skills for the greater good. As Cash is arrested and his gang dismantled, Hauser's life begins to change as he realizes that he has found a new purpose and a sense of belonging within the community. The film concludes with a scene of Hauser, again seated at Benny's, no longer a lonely, tormented man, but surrounded by his newfound comrades. Together, they raise a toast to the brighter future they have fought for, as the camera pans out to reveal a bustling and rejuvenated town, the spirit of unity and resilience shining through."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is this text about?","output":"This text is about Intel's announcement of a delay in the production and release of its highly anticipated television chips, which are based on the Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCOS) technology. LCOS technology is a type of micro-display innovation with the potential to significantly lower the cost of large-screen TVs, making them more affordable for consumers. The decision to delay the release of these chips may have potential implications for the market and the adoption of LCOS technology in the television industry. LCOS technology functions by reflecting and modulating light through liquid crystals instead of directly transmitting light as traditional LCD displays do. This approach can lead to improvements in the quality of images, high-definition resolution, and overall visual performance, as well as offering cost benefits. Intel's announcement of delaying the highly anticipated television chips could be attributed to various reasons, including technical challenges, the need for further refinement, possible competition with related technologies, or strategic considerations. This likely affects not only Intel's own product development plans but also the broader television market, manufacturers, and consumers who might have been eagerly awaiting the introduction of large-screen TVs with LCOS technology at significantly reduced prices.

Safe to say Obama losing even if he may \\"win\\" short-term political blame game on budget. Washington's dysfunction appears to be only deepening. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: President Obama's Hollow Victory: A Dysfunctional Washington Deepens Introduction: In the wake of President Obama's re-election and his enthusiastic call for action, the actual results of his legislative agenda have seemed to be lackluster in 2013. Despite possibly winning the short-term political blame game concerning the budget, Obama finds himself in a losing position due to increased dysfunction in Washington.  Step 1: Discuss President Obama's re-election and initial call to action - Mention Obama's high hopes and renewed energy for his second term in office - Provide examples of his progressive goals and ambitious plans he laid out during his re-election campaign - Highlight the optimism among supporters and the expectation for significant progress on key issues Step 2: Analyze the legislative disappointments of 2013 - Detail the major setbacks and challenges Obama faced in pushing his agenda forward - Examine the reasons behind the failures, including opposition from Republicans and internal divisions among Democrats - Discuss the impact of these failures on the overall perception of the President and his administration Step 3: Delve into Obama's potential \\"win\\" in the political blame game on the budget - Explain the dynamics of the budget debate and how Obama may succeed in shifting the blame onto the Republicans - Discuss the implications of this \\"win\\" for the short-term political landscape in Washington - Argue that despite this perceived victory, Obama is ultimately losing in the broader sense due to the continued deterioration of the political climate in the capital Step 4: Examine the deepening dysfunction in Washington - Assess the impact of partisanship and gridlock on the legislative process - Analyze the role of President Obama in either contributing to, or trying to alleviate, the dysfunction - Debate whether this dysfunction will persist throughout the remainder of Obama's term, and what the potential consequences could be for his legacy and for the country Conclusion: In the face of President Obama's high hopes for his second term, the reality of the legislative landscape in 2013 has proven to be a significant disappointment. Despite the possibility of a short-term \\"win\\" in the budget blame game, President Obama is ultimately losing out due to the deepening dysfunction in Washington.

Given those answer options, answer the question: After their cat developed a cyst on its face, Cameron took it to the veterinarian.  Given the context: What will happen to the cat? A:","output":"After Cameron takes their cat to the veterinarian due to the development of a cyst on its face, the most likely scenario, considering the options provided, is that the cat will be prescribed strong antibiotics to treat the cyst. The veterinarian will first assess the cyst to determine its severity, underlying cause, and the best course of action. In many cases, cysts can result from an infection, such as bacterial or fungal, or they can also be the result of inflammation due to an allergy or some other irritant. The vet may take a sample of the cyst contents to examine it under a microscope, or possibly to conduct a biopsy if they are concerned about the potential of it being a cancerous growth. Once the veterinarian has ruled out more serious concerns and identified the underlying cause, they will likely prescribe strong antibiotics, which Cameron's cat will need to take according to the prescribed regimen. Antibiotics are a common treatment option for bacterial infections and will usually help reduce inflammation and heal the cyst. In some cases, the veterinarian may also drain the cyst to make the healing process faster and to prevent further complications. Throughout the healing process, Cameron needs to closely monitor their cat and ensure it is taking the antibiotics as prescribed. They should also keep an eye on the cyst to ensure it doesn't worsen or start to affect the cat's overall health. Signs such as lack of appetite, lethargy, and increased pain could indicate that the treatment is not working and that Cameron should consult the veterinarian again. Considering the provided answer options, being put up for adoption is not a suitable option for the cat, since Cameron is its owner, and they have already taken the initiative to bring the cat to the vet for treatment. The cat is not a stray or abandoned, and thus, there is no reason for adoption to be a viable solution. In summary, the most probable outcome for Cameron's cat, given the context and answer options, is that it will be prescribed strong antibiotics by the veterinarian to counter the infection and to treat the cyst on its face. With proper care and medication, Cameron's cat should be on the road to recovery and will be able to return to its normal, healthy life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Line your eyelids strategically with eyeliner. Use lengthening mascara on the lashes of your smaller eye. Put eyelid tape on your eyelids to lift the skin.\\"","output":"Title: Enhancing Eye Symmetry: A Comprehensive Guide to Makeup Techniques Introduction: Eyes are often considered the windows to the soul, and their symmetry plays a crucial role in making our faces appear more even and attractive. However, no one's face is entirely symmetrical; it's perfectly natural to have slight variations in eye shape, size, and even position. The great news is that makeup provides a powerful tool to enhance the beauty of your eyes and create a more balanced appearance. In this article, we'll explore the top techniques to make your eyes appear more symmetrical using eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, and eyelid tape. 1. Eyeshadow Application to Create Symmetry Applying eyeshadow strategically can greatly enhance the symmetry of your eyes. Here are some key steps to achieving a balanced look: A. Choose Complementary Colors: Select eyeshadow shades that complement your eye color, skin tone, and your overall makeup look. For daily wear, opt for neutral shades, while for special occasions or nights out, feel free to experiment with more vibrant colors. B. Prime Your Eyelids: Apply an eyeshadow primer to your eyelids before applying the eyeshadow. This step creates a smooth canvas for the eyeshadow and ensures it lasts throughout the day without creasing or fading. C. Apply Base Shadow: Apply a light-colored eyeshadow all over your eyelid as a base. This will set the tone for your look and provide a foundation to build other colors upon. D. Contour and Highlight: Use a slightly darker shade to contour the crease of each eye. This will create depth and dimension. If one eye appears smaller, contour this eye slightly higher and blend well to make both eyes look even. Apply a highlight shade under the brow bone and the inner corner of each eye to lift and illuminate those areas. 2. Strategic Eyeliner Application Eyeliner can either accentuate eye asymmetry or work wonders to balance it out. Here's how you can strategically apply eyeliner to create symmetry: A. Choose the Right Eyeliner: Select an eyeliner that glides smoothly and blends easily for a seamless look. You can choose from a variety of formulas, such as pencil, gel, or liquid. B. Start by Mapping Out Your Line: Before applying the eyeliner, visualize how the liner should follow the natural shape of your eyes. Map it out in your mind, focusing on the areas that need more emphasis for an even appearance. C. Apply Eyeliner on both Eyes: Start by drawing a thin line following your upper lash line. For the smaller eye, you may want to make the line slightly thicker towards the outer corner to create an illusion of a larger and balanced eye. For the other eye, use a thinner line. Take time to analyze and compare both eyes to ensure that the eyeliner is applied evenly and symmetrically. 3. Lengthening Mascara for Smaller Eye Mascara can work wonders in opening up and balancing your eyes. For the smaller eye, focus on applying lengthening mascara on the lashes, concentrating on the outer corner of the eye. This will help create an illusion of larger and more symmetrical eyes. For the other eye, apply mascara evenly, focusing on separating the lashes to avoid clumps. 4. Eyelid Tape for Instant Lift Eyelid tape is an excellent tool in lifting and balancing the skin on the eyelids. This semi-permanent solution works by applying a small piece of adhesive tape on the eyelid crease, instantly providing your eyes with a more even and symmetrical appearance. Follow these steps to apply eyelid tape: A. Clean the Eyelid: Ensure your eyelid is clean and free of any makeup or oils, as this will help the tape adhere well. B. Cut the Tape: Cut a small piece of tape based on the size of your eyelid. Depending on your eye shape and desired symmetry, you may want to cut it into a crescent shape or keep it as a straight strip. C. Apply the Tape: Using a tweezer, place the tape on the upper eyelid skin. Press gently and adjust as needed to create a natural-looking crease that balances both eyes. D. Blend with Makeup: After applying the eyelid tape, use eyeshadow, and eyeliner to blend the tape seamlessly with your overall makeup look. Conclusion: With these strategic makeup techniques, you can enhance your eye symmetry and achieve a more well-balanced appearance. Remember that practice makes perfect, and as you refine your makeup skills, the more naturally symmetrical your eyes will appear. Embrace the unique beauty of your eyes and remember to let your confidence shine through."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

OPT:  A). vegetables were just easier for him..  B). fruits were just easier for him..","output":"Growing vegetables was a success for the man, but he could never grow fruits, as vegetables were just easier for him to cultivate and maintain in comparison to the fruit varieties. Various factors contributed to his thriving vegetable garden and his inability to grow fruits successfully. The man had a natural affinity and understanding for nurturing vegetables, as he was familiar with their growth patterns, nutritional needs, and seasonal demands. He had acquired substantial knowledge about vegetables over the years through research, trial and error, and his observations of other successful gardens. This expertise allowed him to create a nurturing environment for vegetable growth that matched the specific needs of each plant – whether it be the soil type, watering schedule, or the amount of sunlight and shade each plant required. Furthermore, his location and local climate played a significant role in the success of his vegetable garden. The region in which he lived might have been more favorable for vegetable cultivation, providing the right combination of temperature, humidity, and seasonal changes to help vegetables thrive. This factor could also contribute to his inability to grow fruits, as certain fruit varieties require specific climate conditions that might not have existed in his area. In addition to climate constraints, the man's lack of knowledge about fruit cultivation could have played a role in his failure to yield a successful fruit garden. Growing fruits can be more challenging than vegetables, as they often require additional care, such as pruning, disease prevention, and proper pollination techniques. Moreover, certain fruit varieties can be more susceptible to pests, which may have caused a significant setback in his attempt to grow them. Finally, the space available in his garden might have limited the man's capacity to grow fruits, as many fruit trees need ample room for root growth and may require more space to mature compared to vegetables. The available soil quality may not have been favorable for fruit trees, as they typically demand specific nutrient compositions and pH levels to grow and produce fruit. In conclusion, the success of the man's vegetable garden was primarily driven by his extensive knowledge, favorable climate, and suitable space for growing vegetables. However, his inability to grow fruits could be attributed to the lack of proper information about fruit cultivation, unsuitable climate conditions for specific fruit varieties, increased susceptibility to pests and diseases, and available garden space. With the right information, resources, and adjustments in his gardening practices, the man might be able to overcome these challenges and achieve success in growing fruits as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It along with its b-side \\"He Knows I'd Love to See Him\\" appears on the compilation album \\"Bona Drag\\". Context_4 : The ouija ( or ), also known as a spirit board or talking board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words \\"yes\\", \\"no\\", \\"hello\\" (occasionally), and \\"goodbye\\", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic called a planchette. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. \\"Ouija\\" is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc., but is often used generically to refer to any talking board. Context_5 : William Fuld (July 24, 1870–February 24, 1927) was an American businessman, inventor, and entrepreneur from Baltimore, Maryland who is best known for his marketing and manufacture of Ouija boards from the 1890s through the 1920s. Fuld is seen as the father of the Ouija board. Though Fuld never claimed to have invented the Ouija board, intense media coverage in the 1920s credited him with it. The misinformation was sustained by his own marketing, and his practice of stamping \\"Original Ouija Board\\" and \\"Inventor\\" on the back of his boards. By the end of his life he would have over 33 patents, trademarks, and copyrights credited to him. Context_6 : Ouija Board (foaled 3 March 2001) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse (named after the ouija board spiritualism device) owned by Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby and trained by Ed Dunlop. In a career spanning four seasons, she won 10 of her 22 races, 7 of them Group 1s, including the Epsom Oaks in 2004 and the Hong Kong Vase in 2005. In 2004, she won the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf and came 2nd to Intercontinental the following year in the same race. In 2006, the Dunlop team took her back to the USA, where she regained her crown in the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. Ouija Board has amassed over £3 million in prize money. Also, she is only the second horse ever to win Breeders' Cup races in non-consecutive years, along with Da Hoss, who won the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1996 and 1998. Context_7 : Ouija is a 2007 Filipino horror-thriller film from director Topel Lee, his paranormal first feature length, from the screenplay by Aloy Adlawan. The film stars Jolina Magdangal, Iza Calzado, Rhian Ramos and Judy Ann Santos haunted by a spirit they accidentally unleashed while playing an Ouija board. Context_8 : Jap Herron: A Novel Written From The Ouija Board was a novel first published in 1917 claimed to be authored by Mark Twain 7 years after his death. The book was transcribed by Emily Grant Hutchings who claimed to have had the novel dictated to her from beyond the grave by the deceased Mark Twain through use of a Ouija board. Context_9 : Ouija is a 2014 American supernatural horror film directed by Stiles White in his directorial debut, produced by Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Bradley Fuller, and Bennett Schneir and written by Juliet Snowden and White, who previously together wrote \\"The Possession\\". It stars Olivia Cooke, Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Douglas Smith, and Bianca A. Santos as teenagers who have unleashed spirits from a Ouija board. Context_10 : \\"Ouija Board, Ouija Board\\" was a single released by Morrissey in November 1989. The single was poorly received by the music press and the public: its highest chart position was No. 18, making it the first Morrissey single not to reach the British top 10. It appeared along with its B-side \\"Yes, I Am Blind\\" on the compilation album \\"Bona Drag\\". A shorter edit, omitting a verse, appeared on the 2010 reissue of \\"Bona Drag\\". fact_1 : Landslide is the name of two board games about the U.S. presidential elections, where players compete to become the president of the United States. fact_2 : The ouija ( or ), also known as a spirit board or talking board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words \\"yes\\", \\"no\\", \\"hello\\" (occasionally), and \\"goodbye\\", along with various symbols and graphics. Question: Are both Landslide an Ouija board games? A:","output":"The task is asking you to answer the given question based on the context paragraphs and supporting facts provided. Guidelines provided: 1. Context paragraphs and facts offer information on Ouija boards and the game Landslide. 2. Use this information to determine if both Landslide and Ouija are board games. Steps to find the answer: 1. From Context_2 and fact_1, we learn that Landslide is a board game about U.S. presidential elections where players compete to become president. 2. From Context_4 and fact_2, we understand that the Ouija board is a flat board used for communicating with spirits, marked with letters, numbers, and words. Using the provided guidelines and information from the context paragraphs and facts, we can conclude that while both Landslide and Ouija boards are types of board, only Landslide is a board game, and the Ouija board is a tool for communicating with spirits and not a game."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

According to the Secret History, Temüjin again offered his friendship to Jamukha, asking him to return to his side. Temüjin had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer of friendship and reunion, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom is to die without spilling blood, which is granted by breaking the back. Jamukha requested this form of death, despite the fact that in the past Jamukha had been known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as \\"a pretty positive one\\" and \\"very intense and spiritual.\\" Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, \\"There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed.\\" Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles \\"I Am Mine\\" and \\"Save You\\". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as \\"Love Boat Captain\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said \\"Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy—a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours.\\" The track entitled \\"Arc\\" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act's \\"Buhleaguer\\", a commentary on President George W. Bush, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had \\"impaled\\" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's Denver, Colorado show.In June 2003,...

Question: How would Bailey feel afterwards?  Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: kind  B: generous  C: rude The answer is:","output":"B: generous In the given context, Bailey made a scarf for their friend and gave it to them on their birthday. This action of creating a handmade gift and giving it to someone on a special occasion is an expression of thoughtfulness, effort, and selflessness. Bailey has put time and energy into creating something unique and meaningful for their friend, and this behavior aligns closely with the concept of generosity. Generosity encompasses not only the act of giving gifts but also the intention behind the action. It involves putting others' needs and feelings into consideration and heartily giving without expecting anything in return. Bailey's actions in this context clearly demonstrate this quality, as they chose to create a personalized gift and present it to their friend to celebrate their birthday. While kindness (option A) could also be a potential characteristic of Bailey's actions, it is not as specific as the term generous in describing the situation. Kindness is a broader term that involves being considerate, friendly, and helpful to others, and though making a scarf for their friend could be seen as kind, the added context of giving it as a birthday gift leans more towards being generous. As for option C, \\"rude,\\" it is not applicable to the context at all. Rude behavior refers to being impolite, disrespectful, or insensitive towards others, and Bailey's actions in this scenario are quite the opposite. Therefore, out of the three options provided - kind (A), generous (B), and rude (C) - the answer B: generous best describes how Bailey would feel according to the given context. Bailey demonstrated a remarkable level of generosity by creating a heartfelt gift for their friend and presenting it to them on their special day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) are a married lesbian couple living in the Los Angeles area. Nic is an obstetrician, and Jules is a housewife who is starting up a landscape design business. Each has given birth to a child using the same sperm donor. The younger child Laser (Josh Hutcherson) wants to find his sperm donor father but has to be 18 to do so. He implores his 18-year-old sister, Joni (Mia Wasikowska), to contact the sperm bank which identifies Paul (Mark Ruffalo) as the donor. The three meet. Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle, and Paul becomes enthusiastic about being in their lives. Joni swears her brother to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea. While working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career. Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, and they end up in bed together, beginning an affair. Jules and the kids start spending more time with Paul. Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycleâwhich Nic has forbiddenâand by suggesting she give Joni more freedom.

Morbid Angel is an American death metal band based in Tampa, Florida formed in 1983 by guitarist and sole remaining original member Trey Azagthoth, vocalist and bassist Dallas Ward, and drummer Mike Browning. Widely considered as one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its thrash metal roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo blast beats, multiple tempo changes and dark atmosphere. They have been described as one of \\"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\\", alongside Obituary and Cannibal Corpse, and have been cited as an influence by many later bands. They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to Giant Records in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \\"God of Emptiness\\" shown on an episode of Beavis and Butt-head. Morbid Angel was formed in 1983 in Tampa, Florida by guitarist Trey Azagthoth and drummer/vocalist Mike Browning. The band made their debut in 1987 on the New Renaissance Records record label. They recorded their debut album, Abominations of Desolation, in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991, printing 10,000 copies. In the early stages of their career the band developed a reputation for \\"gruesome stage antics.\\"  In 1986, David Vincent joined the band, replacing Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough as vocalist and bassist respectively. Fellow Terrorizer drummer Pete Sandoval soon followed. Their first studio album, Altars of Madness, was released in 1989, and is regarded by many as one of the most important death metal albums of all time. It is also considered the first true death metal album. Music journalist Jason Birchmeier writes that:  Few albums struck a chord within the ears and minds of the late-'80s underground metal scene like Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness did at the end of the decade, setting a new precedent for metal bands to reach. With the arguable exception of Chuck Schuldiner's Death, never before had a heavy metal band carried their lightning-fast guitar riffs and equally spellbinding guitar solos into such horrific territory. Venom and Slayer redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children's music compared to the Florida-based group's assaulting death metal sounds and their blasphemous lyrics.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Morbid Angel is a special band from Florida that started in 1983. They play a type of music called death metal, which can be fast, loud, and scary for some people. This band helped make this kind of music very popular, and many other bands try to sound like them now. They were even on a funny TV show called Beavis and Butt-head! The people who started Morbid Angel are named Trey, Dallas, and Mike. As they made more music, new friends like David and Pete joined them. They made their first big music album in 1989 and it is called Altars of Madness. A lot of people think this album is very important for death metal music because it was the first of its kind. One interesting thing about Morbid Angel is that they sometimes did some weird and scary things on stage during their shows, but they became even more famous because their music was very special and different from other metal bands. They helped make death metal music what it is today and are considered a big influence for many musicians!"},{"instruction":"Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory. The first task he was given is to look at two atoms and to jot down as much information about the two as he can. First, he needs to come up with an identification for these atoms. Since he is new, he decides to keep it professional and simply call the larger of the two atoms \\"atom L\\" and the smaller one \\"atom S\\". Now that he's taken care of that he can get down to work.  Which atom's removed valence electron is closer to its own nucleus?  Hint: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons.

As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification. For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - Angels Fall First is the debut studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish . The original 500 - copies limited edition features seven tracks , two of which are not on the regular edition . This edition is highly sought after by collectors and in 2012 a copy was sold for  1137.23 on eBay . The album was released in the US by Century Media in March 2001 .  - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.  - eBay Inc. (;) is an American multinational corporation and e-commerce company, providing consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales services via the Internet. It is headquartered in San Jose, California. eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995, and became a notable success story of the dot-com bubble. Today it is a multibillion-dollar business with operations localized in over 30 countries.  - Delain is a Dutch symphonic metal band formed in 2002 by former Within Temptation keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, and Charlotte Wessels. The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\".  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Erno \\"Emppu\\" Matti Juhani Vuorinen (born 24 June 1978) is a Finnish guitarist, most famous for being a founding member and occasional songwriter of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is the oldest of five children, having a twin brother and three younger sisters. He started to play guitar as a private study at the age of 12 and since then has played in various bands including Nightwish, Brother Firetribe, Barilari, Almah, and Altaria.  - Jukka Antero \\"Julius\\" Nevalainen (born 21 April 1978, Kitee, Finland) is the drummer in the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and the Finnish progressive metal band Sethian.   - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s.  - Tarja Soile Susanna Turunen-Cabuli (born August 17, 1977), known professionally as Tarja Turunen or simply Tarja, is a Finnish singer-songwriter.

In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.  - Marko Tapani \\"Marco\\" Hietala (born 14 January 1966) is a Finnish heavy metal vocalist, bass guitarist and songwriter. Internationally, he is most known as the current bass guitarist, male vocalist and secondary composer to Tuomas Holopainen, of the symphonic metal band Nightwish. He is also the vocalist and bassist as well as composer and lyricist for the heavy metal band Tarot.  - Tuomas Lauri Johannes Holopainen (born 25 December 1976) is a Finnish songwriter, multi-instrumentalist musician (but mainly keyboardist) and record producer, best known as the founder, leader, keyboardist and songwriter of symphonic metal band Nightwish. He has also studied jazz and classical styles, but prefers to be influenced by harmonic film music.  - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"In what year does the passage first mention Rahmon receiving scrutiny?\\" is in \\"The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.\\".

Read this article and answer this question Hoping to build on their home win over the Jets, the Browns flew to Qualcomm Stadium to take on the throwback-clad San Diego Chargers.  In the first quarter, things started off close with Chargers kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 29-yard field goal, while Browns kicker Phil Dawson nailed a 37-yarder.  In the second quarter, Dawson would get a 20-yard field goal for Cleveland.  However, San Diego got the first touchdown of the game, as LB Marques Harris recovered a fumble in the Browns endzone for a touchdown.  Dawson would supply the scoring for Cleveland for the rest of the half, as he nailed a 42-yarder and a 30-yarder.  In the third quarter, the Chargers gained some momentum, as RB LaDainian Tomlinson, after getting bottled up in the first half, broke out with a 41-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Dawson would get another field goal, which came from 36 yards out.  However, San Diego would respond with Tomlinson getting a 7-yard TD run.  Cleveland would have Dawson get a 35-yard field goal, yet Tomlinson would get an 8-yard TD run, which was followed by a successful two-point conversion from QB Philip Rivers to WR Vincent Jackson.  The Browns would finally get a touchdown, as QB Charlie Frye completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  Unfortunately, the damage was already done.

How to calculate btu per square foot<br>Measure your square footage. Measure the square footage of each room you plan to heat or cool and add them together. If you're installing a furnace or central air conditioning system, this typically includes every room. Can we draw the following conclusion? central air conditioning system has a x Options are:  + Yes;  + It's impossible to say;  + No;","output":"Before I answer the options provided, let me first explain how to calculate BTU per square foot for heating or cooling purposes. In calculating BTU per square foot, one must take into consideration not just the square footage of each room but also the specifics of each space in question. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you determine the BTUs needed for your air conditioning or heating system: 1. Measure the square footage of each room: Using a tape measure, measure the length and width of each room in your home. Multiply the length by the width to determine the square footage of each room.  2. Add up the total square footage: Add together the square footage of all the rooms you plan to heat or cool. This will give you the total square footage for your home. If you're installing a central air conditioning or heating system, typically every room will be included. 3. Determine the insulation level: Assess the insulation level in your home, considering factors like the building's age, construction material, and quality of insulation. Homes with better insulation will require fewer BTUs, while homes with poor insulation will require more. 4. Use a BTU calculator or chart: There are numerous BTU calculators available online or you can use a chart provided by the manufacturer of heating or cooling equipment to determine the approximate BTU per square foot. These calculators often require additional information such as the room's ceiling height, number of occupants, number of windows and doors, and insulation quality. 5. Make adjustments for specific factors: Some factors may require you to adjust the calculated BTU per square foot. For instance, rooms with high ceilings or excessive sunlight may need extra cooling, and you might need to add more BTUs per square foot in those cases. Similarly, for heating purposes, take into account factors such as building materials, climate, and other heat sources. Now, let's address the conclusion and options you provided. Central air conditioning system has a x It seems like there's missing information in this conclusion, possibly relating to the BTU per square foot variable (x). Assuming that \\"x\\" is the BTU per square foot required for the central air conditioning system, the proper conclusion should be: \\"Central air conditioning system has a certain BTU per square foot requirement, which is influenced by various factors such as room size, insulation levels, climate, building materials and other specific considerations.\\" Options are: + Yes: This answer is not a perfect fit since the original conclusion has missing information and needs to be rephrased to accurately depict BTU per square foot requirements. + It's impossible to say: This answer could be fitting only if there's not enough information provided to determine the BTU per square foot requirement for the central air conditioning system in question. + No: This answer can be the right choice if you determine that the conclusion does not accurately depict the necessary information required to calculate BTU per square foot. Based on the detailed explanation and assumption that \\"x\\" represents the BTU per square foot requirement, I would lean towards suggesting the third option, \\"No,\\" as the most suitable, given the provided context. However, with more information and clarity, the appropriate choice may change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Warning: This story contains graphic details      The intense manhunt for Luka Rocco Magnotta, wanted in the gruesome Montreal killing of a university student from China, has come to an end at an Internet café in Berlin.      Clean-shaven and wearing jeans, sunglasses and a black jacket with a hood, Mr. Magnotta, 29, walked into the Internet Spaetkauf Helin in a working-class neighbourhood of Berlin around 11:45 a.m. Monday and asked to use a computer.      He looked familiar to café owner Ulku Sungur and worker Kader Anlayisli. The Canadian murder suspect’s pictures had been plastered on newspapers, television screens and websites around the globe since body parts of Lin Jun, a 33-year-old Chinese national who was studying at Concordia University, were found in Montreal and mailed to political parties in Ottawa last week.      Staff at the café noticed Mr. Magnotta was looking at porn. He also appeared to be checking out articles about himself and the international manhunt underway to find him.      “We thought he looked familiar, but we couldn’t be sure,” Mr. Sungur said. “In person, he looked a little different.”      Mr. Sungur and his worker took to the Internet themselves to check. Once they were fairly certain of his identity, Mr. Anlayisli ran outside to flag down the police, which often patrol Berlin’s Neukoelln district, a neighbourhood with high unemployment and a lot of crime.      Around 1:30 p.m., with Mr. Magnotta still surfing online, seven police officers stormed into the café and quickly overpowered the slender Mr. Magnotta. He tried to give police a false name, but the officers weren’t buying it, Captain Guido Busch of the Berlin police said. (You can watch surveillance footage of the arrest here)      Mr. Magnotta then gave up the ruse: “You got me,” he said.      His arrest drew expressions of relief in Europe, China and here at home.      In Montreal, police Commander Ian Lafrenière said investigators “are extremely relieved and happy” about Mr. Magnotta’s arrest. He is expected to appear before a judge in Germany on Tuesday. It’s unclear how long extradition to Canada will take.      Mr. Magnotta is facing five charges in Montreal, including first-degree murder, causing an indignity to a body, corrupting morals, using the mail system to deliver “obscene, indecent, immoral or scurrilous” material, and harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper.      Mr. Harper commended police Monday for catching Mr. Magnotta.      “Well, I’m obviously pleased that the suspect has been arrested, and I just want to congratulate the police forces on their good work,” the Prime Minister said in London, where he is attending the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee      Mr. Lin, who was enrolled in computer science and worked part-time at a convenience store, had been in Canada for about a year. Police say his killing and dismemberment was filmed and posted on Internet gore sites. Web viewers mused for days about whether the film was real or not before Mr. Lin’s dismembered body was found and Montreal police began an investigation.      The scene of the crime, a second-floor studio apartment overlooking an expressway in Montreal, still contained the marks of violence days after the killing. A double mattress and a crumpled pink sheet were stained with dried blood. Splotches of blood also covered the floor of the fridge.      The rental apartment had been the home of Mr. Magnotta. He had moved in three to four months ago, the building’s superintendent said.      Mr. Magnotta and the victim knew each other, crossing paths at some point this spring. Acquaintances of Mr. Lin recalled he was looking for love. The last entry on his Facebook page was dated May 11. It included a photo of a park on which he wrote: \\"It's too, too, too, beautiful.\\"      The murder of Mr. Lin has provoked widespread shock and anger in China, where many believe the crime was racially motivated. The Chinese embassy in Ottawa has warned citizens living or travelling in Canada to \\"strengthen their personal security\\" in the wake of the deadly attack.      Mr. Lin’s death is the second killing of a Chinese student in Canada in just over a year, following last April's murder of York University student Liu Qian, part of which was watched on Skype by her boyfriend back in China.      Huang Kankan, Mr. Lin’s former boss at a convenience store in the working-class Montreal neighbourhood of Verdun, said he looks forward to Mr. Magnotta’s trial, and the possibility that justice will be served. Mr. Huang described Mr. Lin as a reliable worker who was usually in good humour. ||||| MANHUNT      Luka Rocco Magnotta, the Canadian porn star accused in a gruesome killing and dismemberment, knew how to live underground—so why was he found undisguised, reading stories about himself in a Berlin Internet café? Winston Ross reports.      Canada’s so-called Cannibal Killer could have remained on the lam for a long time.      Luka Rocco Magnotta successfully fled Montreal—by plane, no less—in advance of a nationwide arrest warrant issued after the one-time male model and low-budget gay porn star allegedly killed his lover, 33-year-old Chinese national Jun Lin. Magnotta made it to Paris, then slipped into Berlin, despite an international manhunt. As far as the authorities knew, he was lurking in the alleyways of France, not Germany.      He apparently knew how to cut ties with his family and friends, how to steal identities, how to disguise himself. And it seems that as a resident of the seedy underworld of male prostitution, he could easily finance his flight by selling himself in an industry that doesn’t require much in the way of passports.      But in the end, the 29-year-old who is accused of carrying out one of the most barbaric killings in Canada’s history was brought down by his own worst nemesis: Luka Rocco Magnotta.      Magnotta’s first problem was that he’d made himself famous long before allegedly dismembering Lin and mailing his body parts to Canada’s highest political offices. Magnotta plastered pictures of his own half-naked body all over the Internet. He may have spread rumors in an attempt to connect himself to child-killer Karla Homolka so that he could come out and publicly denounce them later. He reportedly posted videos of himself killing kittens on the Internet, then boasted to British newspapers that they hadn’t seen anything yet and that humans would be his next victims.      By the time Magnotta allegedly carried out that threat, he was already famous, already a household name in Canada. It’s not easy to hide when everyone knows what you look like.      “He was using the web to glorify himself,” Montreal Police Cmdr. Ian LaFreniere told The Daily Beast. “This is the same web that brought him down.”      The crime itself only magnified his notoriety. Montreal police say Magnotta filmed himself doing all kinds of dastardly things to his victim: slitting his throat, decapitating him, slicing off his arms and legs with a kitchen knife, feeding the flesh to a dog, having sex with the limbless corpse. That alone would warrant the kind of front-page media attention Magnotta seems to crave; allegations that he mailed the body parts to political offices garnered the suspect instant international notoriety.      Somehow, he made it to Berlin undetected. And that’s where Luka Rocco Magnotta all but strolled into Potsdamer Platz with the words “Arrest me: I’m an international fugitive” scrawled in blood on his bare chest.      When the cops found him, Magnotta was wearing no wig, no skirt—he’s been known to pose as a woman—no disguise of any kind. And if you thought that stupidity couldn’t be topped, consider where the police picked him up: in a bustling Internet cafe.      Reading articles about himself.      “You got me,” he reportedly told the cops who arrested him.      “His biggest problem is that he’s an attention whore,” Washington, D.C., criminal profiler Pat Brown told The Daily Beast. “He’s in these Internet cafes because he’s so excited about what he’s done.”      To Brown, that’s one of the more interesting facets of a guy who’s already proved himself to be plenty bizarre. Magnotta’s alleged past as an animal abuser fits the profile of a serial killer, a genre of psychopath that tends to derive the most satisfaction from the murders themselves, not the attention they get as a result. It’s the plotting, the choosing of victims, the technique of the murder that gets a typical serial killer off. And because they enjoy that so much, they take meticulous steps to avoid getting caught, so as to keep killing, to experience that thrill again and again. Montreal police are now reviewing cold cases to see if any could be linked to Magnotta, LaFreniere said.      A mass murderer, on the other hand, is all about the notoriety. He plans to make a huge splash with the killing, to take out as many people as possible, to go down in history and probably die in the process. Avoiding prosecution is an afterthought.

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason      It seems that Magnotta blends the two stereotypes, Brown said. The video, if it is really him, seems to make clear he thoroughly enjoyed himself and drew it out as long as possible. That’s serial-killer stuff. But the self-aggrandizing, the need to get online and read news stories about yourself—that fits the mass-murder profile better.      “It’s an odd crossover,” Brown said. “The serial killer enjoys the act of killing, one on one. He doesn’t care whether anybody else knows. He wants you to think he’s Clark Kent, but he’s really Superman.”      Another problem for Magnotta, said former FBI profiler Clint Van Zandt, is that the fantasy he appears to have built up about himself—glamorous porn star, gruesome killer, cunning fugitive—doesn’t exactly track with reality.      The killing part Magnotta accomplished well, according to police. But what he didn’t seem to account for, Van Zandt told The Daily Beast, is that the crime police say he committed would result in a real international manhunt.      “Real cops with real guns were going to find him, real quick,” Van Zandt said. “He had no experience in running or hiding. He finally got to the point where he could act out this fantasy, but with no game plan about how to escape.”      Magnotta’s short-lived career at a fugitive was so poorly executed it makes you wonder if he was trying to get caught. Van Zandt wouldn’t go that far, though. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The manhunt for Luka Rocco Magnotta ended at an internet café in Berlin.

Article: When we walked into Papillon Bleu, a Chinese restaurant around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal's Old Port, the sole waiter on duty looked surprised to see us. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, at the height of tourist season, just one young white family sat in the dining room. We walked past them to a table in the back, Chopin drifting quietly from the speakers into the certain shade of dim light that only Chinese restaurants seem to have. At our seats, bright yellow napkins, folded into fans, rested on a blue tablecloth next to cutlery . Sometime in the last 18 years of operation, Papillon Bleu stopped bothering with chopsticks. \\"How did you find out about us?\\"our waiter politely asked. I told him that my family used to own a Chinese restaurant that served peanut butter dumplings and I wanted to taste them again. Papillon Bleu came up when I googled\\"Best Peanut Butter Dumplings in Montreal\\". He shook his head and told us that while it might have been the case a few years ago, they had switched peanut butter brands to cut costs. But the significance for me wasn't which brand they used, it was that they served peanut butter dumplings. Commonly known as Hunan dumplings, this specialty exists neither in China, nor anywhere else in North America. Instead, Hunan dumplings are a unique Quebecois tradition, and a slowly dying one, found in the second-generation Chinese family restaurants. Peanut butter dumplings taste exactly how they sound, but also unlike anything else. It is a kind of dumpling that coats your mouth with a distinct store-brand quality, a little too sweet, but buttery, and luxuriously  warm, perfectly suited to resist the bone-chilling effects of the Montreal winter. Question: What can we infer about the restaurant? Options: A: It still uses chopsticks. B: It is well decorated. C: The business hour is long. D: The business is not promising.","output":"From the given article, we can infer that the restaurant - Papillon Bleu, is not doing promising business. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, during the peak tourist season, only one family was present in the dining room which indicates the business might not be thriving. This is further supported by the waiter's surprise on seeing the new customers. Moreover, the restaurant switched peanut butter brands to cut costs, which could be another indication of a struggling business. Thus, the best answer to the question is option D: The business is not promising."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. 1.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, although there are some minor differences in punctuation and wording. Both statements convey the same primary idea: In 1967, automatic transmission became the standard, while manual transmission, with or without overdrive, was available as an option. The differences in punctuation and phrasing do not significantly alter the message or meaning of the sentences.  In the first sentence, the use of semicolons helps separate the main clauses, which are “Automatic transmission became standard” and “manual, with or without overdrive, was an option in 1967.” The semicolon is used to indicate that these two clauses are related but can stand alone as separate sentences. On the other hand, the second sentence uses a comma instead of a semicolon to separate the clauses which is also acceptable but less formal. Regarding the phrasing, there aren't substantial changes but there are two slight differences: 1. The first sentence uses \\"manual\\" whereas the second sentence uses \\"manually.\\" In this context, the use of \\"manual\\" is more appropriate, as it refers to a type of transmission rather than an adverb (which is what \\"manually\\" is). Nonetheless, the intended meaning is still understandable in the second sentence. 2. The second sentence includes an additional comma before \\"with or without overdrive.\\" This aspect is a stylistic choice and does not change the meaning of the sentence. The presence or absence of the comma in this case does not alter the interpretation of the phrase. In summary, despite minor differences in punctuation and phrasing, these two sentences can be considered paraphrases, as both convey the same essential information about the availability of automatic and manual transmission options in 1967."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Now, I have a new situation: Jim and Greg are brothers who both run their own farms, but they rarely see each other due to them living in different states. Greg runs a farm in Texas where he rarely sees rain so he spends much of his day watering his crops. Jim lives in Illinois where it rains much more regularly so he has more time to spend dealing with his farm animals instead of watering his plants. Both men intentionally purchased their farms next to lakes since they have always loved fishing during their free time. The brothers are currently planning a fishing trip together, but they are just debating which lake to travel to.  Answer this question please: Will Greg's lake have more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's?","output":"In general, it is difficult to conclusively determine which lake will have more or less carbon dioxide without taking other factors into account. However, we can infer some possibilities based on the given information. Greg's farm in Texas experiences less rainfall, meaning that there will be less runoff carrying fertilizers from his farm into the adjacent lake. As a result, there is a lower likelihood of nutrient-rich water promoting excessive algae growth in the lake. In the absence of excessive algae, carbon dioxide levels in the water may be more stable, as there will not be an overwhelming amount of algae consuming the carbon dioxide. On the other hand, Jim's farm in Illinois experiences more rainfall, increasing the chances of runoff carrying fertilizers into his adjacent lake. This could potentially lead to excessive algae growth due to the increased nitrogen levels, causing the algae to consume more carbon dioxide from the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and consume oxygen, creating a dead zone with lower levels of oxygen and possibly higher levels of carbon dioxide. In summary, Greg's lake in Texas would likely have less carbon dioxide than Jim's lake in Illinois, due to lower rainfall causing less runoff carrying fertilizers into the water, leading to a lower likelihood of excessive algae growth and dead zones. However, several other factors, such as the size and depth of the lakes, wind patterns, and the types and amounts of fertilizers used, could also influence the carbon dioxide levels in the lakes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the teen began to walk away, Diaz told him, \\"Hey, wait a minute. You forgot something. If you're going to be robbing people for the rest of the night, you might as well take my coat to keep you warm.\\" The robber looked at him puzzled, saying, \\"Why are you doing this?\\" Diaz replied, \\"If you're willing to risk your freedom for a few dollars, then you must really need the money. I mean, all I wanted to do was get dinner and if you really want to join me.....\\" Diaz says he and the teen went into a diner and sat in a booth. \\"The manager comes by, the dishwashers come by, the waiters come by to say hi,\\" Diaz says. The kid said, \\"You know everybody here. Do you own this place?\\" \\"No, I just eat here a lot,\\" Dias said. \\"But you're even nice to the dishwasher,\\" he said. Diaz replied, \\"Well, haven't you been taught you should be nice to everybody?\\" \\"Yea, but I didn't think people actually behaved that way,\\" the teen said. When the bill arrived, Diaz said, \\"You're going to have to pay for this bill because you have my money and I can't pay for this. So if you give me my wallet back, I'll gladly treat you.\\" The teen returned it immediately. \\"I gave him 20.... I figure maybe it'll help him.\\" Diaz says he asked for something in return--- the teen's knife--- \\"and he gave it to me.\\" Afterwards, when Diaz told his mother what happened, she said, \\"You're the type of kid that if someone asked you for the time, you gave them your watch.\\" \\"I figure, you know, if you treat people right, you can only hope that they treat you right.

Premise: \\"uh-huh yeah but uh every once in a while i like to watch some of the old movies i watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Occasionally, I enjoy an old movie. \\"?","output":"If we take the given premise, \\"uh-huh yeah but uh every once in a while I like to watch some of the old movies I watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night,\\" we can analyze its relation to the hypothesis \\"Occasionally, I enjoy an old movie.\\" In order to do this, let us dissect the components of the premise. The premise has two main ideas: 1. The speaker confirms a habit of watching movies from time to time: \\"uh-huh yeah but uh every once in a while I like to watch some of the old movies.\\" 2. The speaker provides an example of a recent scenario where they watched an old movie with Clint Eastwood: \\"I watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night.\\" Now, let's consider the hypothesis, \\"Occasionally, I enjoy an old movie.\\" The hypothesis essentially suggests that the speaker derives pleasure or enjoyment from watching old movies on an intermittent basis. Upon comparison, we can identify clear similarities between the premise and the hypothesis. The first idea in the premise corresponds with the hypothesis as both convey that the speaker watches old movies periodically. While the premise does not explicitly mention the term 'occasionally', the phrase \\"every once in a while\\" conveys a similar message - that the action takes place sporadically rather than regularly. Furthermore, the second idea in the premise offers evidence for the speaker actually engaging in watching old movies, which strengthens the connection between the premise and the hypothesis. This recent experience of watching a Clint Eastwood movie demonstrates the speaker's appreciation for classic films. Although the speaker doesn't directly mention \\"enjoyment\\" in the premise, we can infer this through the context and tone. The voluntary nature of watching old movies, coupled with the speaker's habit of partaking in this activity from time to time, suggests that they derive pleasure or satisfaction from it. In conclusion, given the premise \\"uh-huh yeah but uh every once in a while I like to watch some of the old movies I watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night,\\" it can be reasonably inferred that it entails the hypothesis \\"Occasionally, I enjoy an old movie.\\" Both the premise and hypothesis highlight the speaker's intermittent engagement in watching old movies, with the premise providing a concrete example of this habit through the mention of a Clint Eastwood film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jonah or Jonas is the name given in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh/Old Testament) to a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel in about the 8th century BCE. He is the eponymous central figure of the Book of Jonah, in which he is called upon by God to travel to Nineveh and warn its residents to repent of their sins or face divine wrath. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to Tarshish. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. The Book of Jonah (Yonah yvnh) is one of the twelve minor prophets included in the Tanakh. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by Elijah the prophet in 1 Kings 17. Another tradition holds that he was the son of the woman of Shunem brought back to life by Elisha in 2 Kings 4 and that he is called the \\"son of Amittai\\" (Truth) due to his mother's recognition of Elisha's identity as a prophet in 2 Kings 17:24. The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on Yom Kippur - the Day of Atonement, as the Haftarah at the afternoon mincha prayer. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era and the inside of its mouth was like a synagogue; the fish's eyes were like windows and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination.  According to the Midrash, while Jonah was inside the fish, it told him that its life was nearly over because soon the Leviathan would eat them both. Jonah promised the fish that he would save them. Following Jonah's directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it. The Leviathan heard Jonah's threats, saw that he was circumcized, and realized that he was protected by the Lord, so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive.  Teshuva - the ability to repent and be forgiven by God - is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father \\"Amitai\\" in Hebrew means truth), refuses to ask the people of Nineveh to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear. The people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, \\"fasting, including the sheep,\\" and the Jewish scripts are critical of this. The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth. What religious needs?","output":"The religious needs mentioned in the context of the Book of Jonah are comfort and truth. These needs represent two fundamental aspects of religious life and belief. 1. Comfort: Religion often provides a sense of consolation, solace, and support to believers in times of hardship, doubt, or suffering. People may turn to religious beliefs and practices for reassurance and guidance, seeking answers to existential questions and a sense of purpose and meaning in their lives. In the Book of Jonah, the people of Nineveh find comfort in repentance, which helps them avoid divine punishment. 2. Truth: Religion also aims to convey a deeper understanding of reality, revealing divine or spiritual truths that go beyond ordinary human understanding. Religious teachings may offer ethical guidance, cosmological explanations, and insights into the nature of the divine, helping believers discern the ultimate meaning and structure of reality. In the case of Jonah, his status as a prophet and \\"son of truth\\" underscores the importance of conveying God's message to the people of Nineveh. The Book of Jonah showcases the tension between these two religious needs, as Jonah initially resists God's command to preach repentance to the people of Nineveh. The story illustrates the complexity of balancing the need for divine truths and seeking comfort in religious belief and practices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: People with prolonged, frequent, or close contact with people with TB are at particularly high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (\\"overt\\") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others. What is the answer to this question: About how long will a TB patient receiving effective treatment stay contagious?","output":"A TB patient receiving effective treatment will stay contagious for about two weeks.

Article: While Nick was on the bus, reading his newspaper, the man sitting next to him suddenly pushed a large envelope into his hands. \\"Here, take this!\\" the man said, stood up and got off the bus before Nick could say a word. Nick sat there, holding the envelope. It felt heavy. There were papers inside, or money perhaps. \\"I'd better hand it over to the police,\\" he thought. There was a police station close to his office. But, as he got off the bus, a man came to him. He seemed to be waiting for something. \\"He wants the envelope,\\" Nick thought. Nick began to walk quickly, and the man hurried after him. Nick started to run, and the man began to run, too. But then, just before he got to the police station, Nick managed to lose the man in the crowds. When he entered the police station, the man was no longer in sight. Inside the police station, Nick handed over the envelope to a policeman in charge. The man opened it.

(b) a thief - The man's behavior and the envelope containing false money suggest he could be a thief. (c) the bus driver - The bus driver is not involved in the story, so this option does not make sense. (d) a postman - The circumstances of this interaction do not resemble a typical postman delivery. Step 3: Analyzing the options The fact that the envelope contained false money suggests that the man who handed it over to Nick was involved in illegal activities. This points to the man being a thief rather than any of the other choices.

Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius prosecutor Gerrie Nel wants the South African track star sent for independent psychiatric evaluation, he said Monday, in a move that could delay the athlete's murder trial for a month or more.  A psychiatrist testified Monday that Pistorius has an anxiety disorder stemming from his double amputation as an infant and his unstable parents.  He's depressed now and feeling guilt from having killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, defense witness Dr. Meryl Vorster said on the stand.  Nel responded by comparing the athlete's mental state to post-traumatic stress disorder and saying the law required psychiatric observation.  The prosecutor's extremely unusual move is essentially an effort to maneuver the court into considering an insanity or \\"capacity\\" defense even though the athlete's legal team is not mounting one, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. Phelps, a criminologist and law lecturer at the University of Cape Town, said she had never seen this done before.  Pistorius' lead defense lawyer, Barry Roux, is fighting back, saying Nel is oversimplifying the law.  The question was left unresolved when court adjourned for the day. Nel is due to submit his application on Tuesday after both sides have finished questioning Vorster.  The psychiatrist took the stand Monday morning for the defense, going all the way back to when the disabled sprinter was 11 months old.

If you live near a water park, you might think about getting a season pass. This way you can go as often as you like. Check to see if there are any water parks around you. Many are indoor facilities. So even if it isn't warm enough where you live to swim outdoors, you can enjoy swimming in a temperature controlled area. The prices are usually good. For example, one ticket to Water World, a water park, is only 5. Some teens like to get a part time job over the summer to make some pocket money. Older teens shouldn't have much trouble finding jobs. An idea is to get some teens together to form your own summer job business. You can walk dogs, bring in the newspapers, feed the cats, collect rubbish, water flowers, etc. Being that it's summer, many people go on vacation and could use someone to look after their houses while they're away. You can also think about other jobs you can do for them. Teens love freedom. Sure you would like to get to such places as the small, movie theaters, the zoo, the beach, picnic, bowling and local amusement park instead of staying home all summer. Then a summer bus pass will be helpful. Check to see if your area has one for you teens. Such a pass costs only 10 for the whole summer.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Context: Galaxies are the biggest groups of stars and can contain anywhere from a few million stars to many billions of stars. Every star that is visible in the night sky is part of the Milky Way Galaxy. To the naked eye, the closest major galaxy the Andromeda Galaxy, shown in Figure 1.1 looks like only a dim, fuzzy spot. But that fuzzy spot contains one trillion 1,000,000,000,000 stars! Galaxies are divided into three types according to shape: spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and irregular galaxies. Spiral galaxies spin, so they appear as a rotating disk of stars and dust, with a bulge in the middle, like the Sombrero Galaxy shown in Figure 1.2. Several arms spiral outward in the Pinwheel Galaxy (seen in Figure 1.2) and are appropriately called spiral arms. Spiral galaxies have lots of gas and dust and lots of young stars. The Andromeda Galaxy is a large spiral galaxy similar to the Milky Way. (a) The Sombrero Galaxy is a spiral galaxy that we see from the side so the disk and central bulge are visible. (b) The Pinwheel Galaxy is a spiral galaxy that we see face-on so we can see the spiral arms. Because they contain lots of young stars, spiral arms tend to be blue. Figure 1.3 shows a typical egg-shaped elliptical galaxy. The smallest elliptical galaxies are as small as some globular clusters. Giant elliptical galaxies, on the other hand, can contain over a trillion stars. Elliptical galaxies are reddish to yellowish in color because they contain mostly old stars. Most elliptical galaxies contain very little gas and dust because the gas and dust have already formed into stars. However, some elliptical galaxies, such as the one shown in Figure 1.4, contain lots of dust. Why might some elliptical galaxies contain dust? Is the galaxy in Figure 1.5 a spiral galaxy or an elliptical galaxy? It is neither one! Galaxies that are not clearly elliptical galaxies or spiral galaxies are irregular galaxies. How might an irregular galaxy form? Most irregular galaxies were once spiral or elliptical galaxies that were then deformed either by gravitational attraction to a larger galaxy or by a collision with another galaxy. This galaxy, called NGC 1427A, has nei- ther a spiral nor an elliptical shape. Dwarf galaxies are small galaxies containing only a few million to a few billion stars. Dwarf galaxies are the most common type in the universe. However, because they are relatively small and dim, we dont see as many dwarf galaxies from Earth. Most dwarf galaxies are irregular in shape. However, there are also dwarf elliptical galaxies and dwarf spiral galaxies. Look back at the picture of the elliptical galaxy. In the figure, you can see two dwarf elliptical galaxies that are companions to the Andromeda Galaxy. One is a bright sphere to the left of center, and the other is a long ellipse below and to the right of center. Dwarf galaxies are often found near larger galaxies. They sometimes collide with and merge into their larger neighbors. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Click image to the left or use the URL below.

The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease. The University College London (UCL) team is \\"excited\\", but it urges caution as any long-term benefit is uncertain and the drug needs more testing. \\"There's absolutely no doubt the most important unmet need in Parkinson's is a drug to slow down disease progression, it's unarguable,\\" Prof Tom Foltynie, one of the researchers, told the BBC. In Parkinson's, the brain is progressively damaged and the cells that produce the hormone dopamine are lost. It leads to a tremor, difficulty moving and eventually memory problems. Therapies help manage symptoms by boosting dopamine levels, but the death of the brain continues and the disease gets worse. No drug stops that happening. In the trial, half of patients were given the diabetes drug exenatide and the rest were given a placebo (dummy treatment). All the patients stayed on their usual medication. As expected, those on just their usual medication declined over 48 weeks of treatment. But those given exenatide were stable. And three months after the experimental treatment stopped, those who had been taking exenatide were still better off. Prof Foltynie told the BBC News website: \\"This is the first clinical trial in actual patients with Parkinson's where there has been anything like this size of effect. \\"It gives us confidence exenatide is not just masking symptoms, it's doing something to the underlying disease. \\"We have to be excited and encouraged, but also cautious as we need to replicate these findings.\\" They also need to trial the drug for much longer periods of time. An effective drug would need to hold back the disease for years in order to make a significant difference to patients. Parkinson's progresses slowly and the difference in this 60-week trial was definitely there, but was \\"trivial\\" in terms of the impact on day-to-day life, say the researchers. The drug helps control blood sugar levels in diabetes by acting on a hormone sensor called GLP-1. Those sensors are found in brain cells too. It is thought the drug makes those cells work more efficiently or helps them to survive. It is why the drug is being tested in other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. David Dexter, the deputy director of research at Parkinson's UK, said: \\"The findings offer hope that drugs like exenatide can slow the course of Parkinson's - â€Šsomething no current treatment can do. \\"Because Parkinson's can progress quite gradually, this study was probably too small and short to tell us whether exenatide can halt the progression of the condition, but it's certainly encouraging and warrants further investigation.\\" Dr Brian Fiske, from the The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, said: \\"The results from the exenatide studies justify continued testing, but clinicians and patients are urged not to add exenatide to their regimens until more is known about their safety and impact on Parkinson's.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"Okay kiddo, so this is like one of those stories where the good guys find a secret weapon that might help them win. You know Parkinson's disease? It's like a mean monster that keeps hurting parts of the brain, making it hard for those people to move or remember things. The medicines we have so far only help with what the monster's already done, but can't really stop him doing more damage.  However, some scientific heroes in a place called the University College London have found a medicine that might just slow down the damage. This medicine called exenatide, actually used to help people who have too much sugar in their blood, seemed to keep the monster at bay while they tested it with some people.  While this is like a superhero finding a potential new weapon, they're not sure yet if the weapon is safe or how long it can protect for. So, they need to continue testing and experimenting before they can use it to fight the Parkinson's monster. We are still not sure, but there is hope in the air, just like when the sun rises after a dark night."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  In the opinion of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust and author of the Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became \\"the most important country house in Europe\\". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own \\"little Foreign Office ... the hub of resistance\\". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, \\"I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament\\". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confident of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, \\"there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late\\".Churchill also recorded visits to Chartwell by two more of his most important suppliers of confidential governmental information, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, information which he used to \\"form and fortify my opinion about the Hitler Movement\\". Chartwell was also the scene of more direct attempts to prepare Britain for the coming conflict; in October 1939, when reappointed First Lord of the Admiralty on the outbreak of war, Churchill suggested an improvement for anti-aircraft shells; \\"Such shells could be filled with zinc ethyl which catches fire spontaneously ...

The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University.

Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse. A:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. There are several reasons as to why this particular review would influence my decision negatively: 1. Deceptive practices: The reviewer claims that Cingular provided misleading information, stating that they could return the phone for a full refund if needed. This suggests that the company may be employing deceptive practices to make sales. 2. Poor coverage: The reviewer mentions that the phone did not work in their area, indicating that the coverage may be insufficient for at least some potential customers. 3. Activation fees: Even though the phone did not work in the reviewer's area, they were still charged an activation fee after canceling the service. This could be seen as unreasonable and disappointing from a customer's perspective. 4. Customer service issues: The reviewer's experience shows that Cingular was not helpful in resolving the issue, which could reflect overall poor customer service. 5. Amazon's lack of assistance: The reviewer also reports that Amazon was unwilling to provide any reimbursement, which may raise concerns about purchasing the product through this platform. Taking all these factors into account, the negative aspects of the reviewer's experience would discourage me from buying this product and, instead, urge me to look for alternative options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In den letzten Jahren hat die Volksrepublik China eine enorme Nachfrage nach deutschen Automobilen und Industriemaschinen entwickelt, was sich als Katalysator für das Wachstum der deutschen Wirtschaft erwiesen hat. Deutschland, das als Exportland bekannt ist, hat diese Gelegenheit genutzt, um seine Präsenz auf dem chinesischen Markt auszubauen und seine Handelsbeziehungen zu stärken.  Angesichts der wachsenden Mittelschicht in China können sich immer mehr Menschen hochwertige Produkte leisten, und deutsche Autos und Maschinen genießen aufgrund ihrer Technologie, Zuverlässigkeit und Qualität einen unvergleichlichen Ruf. Marken wie Volkswagen, BMW und Mercedes-Benz sind besonders in der Volksrepublik beliebt, sodass China einer der wichtigsten Absatzmärkte für deutsche Autohersteller geworden ist.  Gleichzeitig hat sich Deutschland aufgrund seiner hochmodernen und innovativen Industriemaschinen als wichtiger Lieferant für Chinas wachsende Industrie etabliert.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What type of music was \\"Big Fun\\"? ?  Detroit techno is an offshoot of Chicago house music which developed in the early and mid-1980s. One of the earliest hits was \\"Big Fun\\" by Inner City. Detroit techno developed as the DJ The Electrifying Mojo did his radio program, which fused eclectic sounds into the signature Detroit techno sound. This sound, also influenced by European electronica (Kraftwerk, Art of Noise), Japanese synthpop (Yellow Magic Orchestra), early B-boy (breakdancing) Hip-Hop (Man Parrish, Soul Sonic Force) and Italo disco (Doctor's Cat, Ris, Klein M.B.O.), was further pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three. Derrick May a.k.a. \\"MAYDAY\\" and Thomas Barnett released \\"Nude Photo\\" in 1987 on May's label \\"Transmat Records\\", which helped start the Detroit techno music scene. This record was played on Chicago's Hot Mix 5 Radio DJ mix show and in Chicago clubs. A year later, Transmat released \\"Strings of Life\\". Transmat Records also released such as 1988's \\"Wiggin\\". As well, Derrick May had releases on Kool Kat Records and many remixes for underground and mainstream recording artists. Kevin Saunderson's company KMS Records contributed many releases that were as much house music as they were techno. These tracks were well received in Chicago and played on Chicago radio and in clubs.Blake Baxter's 1986 recording, \\"When we Used to Play / Work your Body\\", 1987's \\"Bounce Your Body to the Box\\" and \\"Force Field\\", \\"The Sound / How to Play our Music\\" and \\"the Groove that Won't Stop\\" and a remix of \\"Grooving Without a Doubt\\". In 1988, as house music became more popular among general audiences, Kevin Saunderson's group Inner City with Paris Gray released the 1988 hits \\"Big Fun\\" and \\"Good Life\\", which eventually were picked up by Virgin Records. Each EP / 12 inch single sported remixes by Mike \\"Hitman\\" Wilson and Steve \\"Silk\\" Hurley of Chicago and Derrick \\"Mayday\\" May and Juan Atkins of Detroit.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A Swarm of Startups Are Filling the Uber Void in Austin Nature abhors a vacuum—and so does business. Just three weeks ago, Uber and Lyft ceased operations in Austin, Texas, following a public referendum that imposed what the transportation network companies considered onerous regulations. And now, in what is arguably America’s second-largest hub of tech startup culture, a half-dozen new or previously lesser-known competitors are angling for a taste of the leftovers. “They left a factory overnight with the machines running and the workers standing by,” Joe Liemandt told Austin Business Observer of the sudden opportunity. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Leimandt is part of a team of local tech leaders working to build RideAustin, a nonprofit ride-hailing service that will channel some revenue to charity. RideAustin is still gearing up, and hopes to launch in June. Other alternatives are moving in fast. Boston-based Fasten will launch Austin service on June 1st, backed by 9.1 million in capital. Fare, produced by Phoenix-based Ride Fare, is already operating in Austin, and says it has processed 700 drivers through the first stage of Austin’s required background check. Dallas-based Get Me is already operating in Austin, along with zTrip and Wingz. There’s also Arcade City, which skirts the new regulations (at least, for now) by allowing drivers to negotiate their own rates, and is planning an app based on the Ethereum blockchain. For more on the Austin ride-hailing saga, watch our video: The Austin government is actively helping these new entrants, including by hosting a job fair and running a hotline to connect former Uber and Lyft drivers with new operators. Though losing one city won’t seriously slow down either Uber or Lyft, the rush of alternatives suggests some shortsightedness in their decision to play chicken with city regulators. While a ride-sharing service isn’t necessarily the easiest thing in the world to build, it also clearly doesn’t have the kind of technological moat that makes it irreproducible. The fact that this is Austin, a major hub of the tech business, has further implications. A foothold in the city could give companies a serious platform for going national, particularly with the huge visibility provided by the annual South by Southwest festival. Of course, the next SXSW is still nine months away, and it’s entirely possible Uber and Lyft will cave in and return to Austin by then.","output":"A while ago, Uber and Lyft stopped working in Austin, Texas because of some new rules they didn't like.

CHAPTER XI  WITH DEJAH THORIS  As we reached the open the two female guards who had been detailed to watch over Dejah Thoris hurried up and made as though to assume custody of her once more. The poor child shrank against me and I felt her two little hands fold tightly over my arm. Waving the women away, I informed them that Sola would attend the captive hereafter, and I further warned Sarkoja that any more of her cruel attentions bestowed upon Dejah Thoris would result in Sarkoja's sudden and painful demise.  My threat was unfortunate and resulted in more harm than good to Dejah Thoris, for, as I learned later, men do not kill women upon Mars, nor women, men. So Sarkoja merely gave us an ugly look and departed to hatch up deviltries against us.  I soon found Sola and explained to her that I wished her to guard Dejah Thoris as she had guarded me; that I wished her to find other quarters where they would not be molested by Sarkoja, and I finally informed her that I myself would take up my quarters among the men.  Sola glanced at the accouterments which were carried in my hand and slung across my shoulder.  \\"You are a great chieftain now, John Carter,\\" she said, \\"and I must do your bidding, though indeed I am glad to do it under any circumstances.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Coal is burned in a boiler - Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins - Creates electricity.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more pressure happens, how will it affect more steam flows into the turbine.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this scenario suggests that an increase in pressure will lead to more steam flowing into the turbine. To thoroughly assess the effects of this supposed perturbation, both directly and indirectly, let's first revisit the details of each step in the process and then examine the consequences of increased pressure on the overall system. 1. Coal is burned in a boiler: The main purpose of the boiler is to produce steam by burning coal. When heat is applied to water, it increases the internal energy and the water molecules eventually turn into steam. 2. Steam is produced under pressure: The pressure inside the boiler ensures that the steam produced has sufficient force to travel across the system and reach the turbine at a necessary rate. Maintaining optimum pressure levels is crucial in the efficiency and effectiveness of steam generation. 3. Steam flows into a turbine: Once the steam is produced under pressure, it flows through pipes and enters the turbine chamber. The high-pressure steam transfers its kinetic energy to the turbine blades, causing them to spin. 4. The turbine spins: As the steam hits the turbine blades, it forces the turbine to rotate, converting the thermal energy from the coal-burning process into mechanical energy. 5. Creates electricity: The spinning turbine is connected to an electric generator, which converts the mechanical energy from the spinning turbine into electrical energy. This electricity is then transmitted to the power grid for distribution to consumers. Now, let's consider the potential consequences of increased pressure in the system, as suggested by the perturbation hypothesis. Direct Effect: The primary direct effect of increased pressure will most likely be an increase in the steam flow rate into the turbine. With more pressure, the steam will have greater force and higher velocity as it enters the turbine chamber. This may lead to the turbine spinning faster, thus generating more electricity. However, this increase might only reach a certain point, as other factors such as the turbine's design and material limitations could restrict the potential benefits of increased pressure. Indirect Effects: Although the increased pressure might seem beneficial from a production standpoint, there are several potential indirect effects that need to be considered. a) Structural integrity: Boilers and turbines are designed to operate within certain pressure limits. Exceeding those limits might cause damage to the equipment and potentially lead to system failure or even dangerous accidents. b) Efficiency: While more pressure initially may lead to an increased flow of steam into the turbine, it could also result in saturation of the steam at higher pressures. Saturated steam is less efficient in transferring energy to the turbine, resulting in reduced overall efficiency of the system. c) Fuel consumption: The burning of more coal to maintain higher pressure might lead to increased fuel consumption, which in turn raises operational costs and contributes to increased greenhouse gas emissions. d) Maintenance: Operating the boiler and turbine under higher pressures could result in increased wear and tear on the equipment, necessitating more frequent and costly maintenance. To summarize, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that increased pressure will result in more steam flowing into the turbine, which might seem beneficial for electricity generation. However, the potential direct and indirect effects of increased pressure should be carefully considered, as it may have negative consequences on system efficiency, equipment integrity, and environmental impact. As such, it is essential to maintain an optimal balance of pressure and steam flow and continuously monitor the system to ensure safe and efficient operation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: If a plant requires less water then that plant will survive in a drought, and some plants are extraordinarily tolerant of drought. Given these facts, some vegetation requires less water and can survive what among the following options: - massive damage  - enormous damage to homes  - Brutal temperatures  - Greenhouse gases  - If it's dry  - prolonged thirst  - reduced heat  - salinity The answer is:","output":"Based on the provided information, some vegetation requires less water and can survive prolonged thirst. In the context of the question, a plant requiring less water is indicative of its ability to survive and thrive even in conditions where water is scarce, such as during a drought. Drought-tolerant plants have adaptations that allow them to withstand low moisture levels and maintain their growth and development with minimal water intake. This capability is primarily attributed to the plant's inherent ability to conserve water and efficiently manage its internal resources. Given the list of options to choose from, the one that best corresponds to the survival capabilities of drought-tolerant plants is \\"prolonged thirst.\\" Prolonged thirst, in this case, describes conditions in which there is a lack or insufficiency of water in the environment that lasts for an extended period. This lack of water can create challenges for many plants, as water is a critical component of plant growth and development, and it is necessary for their health and survival. Drought-tolerant plants are equipped with various strategies to conserve water and withstand prolonged thirst. These adaptations may include: 1. Deep and extensive root systems: These roots help the plant access water from deeper underground sources or use moisture stored in the soil more efficiently. 2. Small or specialized leaves: Leaves with reduced surface areas minimize water loss through transpiration, the process by which plants release water into the atmosphere through their leaves. 3. CAM photosynthesis: Drought-tolerant plants, such as cacti and succulents, may use a specialized form of photosynthesis known as Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM), which enables them to open stomata (pores on their leaves) at night instead of during the day. This allows for a reduced rate of water loss and increased water-use efficiency. 4. Drought dormancy: Some plants can enter a state of drought dormancy, reducing their metabolic processes and conserving water until more favorable conditions return. Given these specialized adaptations and characteristics, we can conclude that some vegetation requires less water and can indeed survive the challenges of prolonged thirst. While the other options mentioned, such as massive damage, brutal temperatures, greenhouse gases, and salinity, are all factors that can affect plant life, they do not necessarily relate directly to the water consumption and drought tolerance capabilities of plants as discussed in the primary question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnnie had a set of small volumes of English verse, extensively annotated by his own hand, which Stoddard had brought to her early in their acquaintance, leaving it with her more as a gift than as a loan.  She kept these little books after all the others had gone back.  She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts.  It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it.  She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins.  She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back.  Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office.  Then the children came in; Deanie was half sick; and in the distress of getting the ailing child comfortably into her own bed, Johnnie forgot the books.

Here is an article: BEIJING (AP)  North Korean leader Friday after a secretive five-day visit that produced an affirmation of long-delayed nuclear disarmament talks but no firm dateline for rejoining that process. Kim's armored train crossed the border back into North Korea midmorning after leaving Beijing Thursday following talks with Chinese leaders that touched on the six-nation denuclearization talks stalled since December 2008. \\"Kim said that the DPRK will work with China to create favorable conditions for restarting the six-party talks,\\" the Xinhua News Agency said in a report on his meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. The visit began Monday and has been shrouded in secrecy in keeping with Kim's reclusive ways. In footage run by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, Kim, 68, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008, appeared thin but relatively vigorous in meetings with Chinese President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao, and other officials. Kim, wearing a pea green leisure suit, was shown shaking hands with Chinese leaders at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, in footage apparently shot on Wednesday night. He exchanged comments with Hu in a conference room, then stood and read from a piece of paper at a banquet table and exchanged toasts, wine glass in hand. Other footage showed him visiting a biotechnology firm accompanied by Hu, during an excursion to Beijing's Zhongguancun high-tech zone believed to have happened Thursday morning. The eccentric Kim is known to shun air travel and travels entirely by road and rail. The Korean Central News agency said in a dispatch from Pyongyang that Kim made the \\"unofficial\\" visit starting Monday and ending Friday. Kim was seen in China by journalists several times, although Chinese spokesmen repeatedly refused to confirm his presence in the country. KCNA did not mention a one-on-one meeting with Hu or even a visit to Beijing, where Kim's motorcade was seen Wednesday and Thursday. It's description of the visit as unofficial appeared to explain the lack of formal protocol such as an official welcoming ceremony or the flying of North Korean flags in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Kim has grown ever more dependent on Chinese aid and diplomatic support, while Beijing appears determined to provide whatever support necessary to prevent his impoverished regime's implosion and the potential political chaos that could bring severe unrest to its border. The KCNA report said Kim toured the northeastern cities of Dalian and Tianjin and met with vice premier Li Keqiang and other officials. \\"The leader of the DPRK received a sincere and warm welcome from Chinese people wherever he went in China,\\" KCNA said. \\"Kim Jong Il expressed satisfaction over the result of his visit.\\" This week's visit was Kim's fifth to China since succeeding his father as ruler in 1994, the last being in 2006. South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that Kim told Hu he is ready to return to denuclearization talks, under which North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear programs in return for food and fuel aid. Kim has similar things in past, but usually with attached conditions, such as a long-sought direct dialogue with the United States. Yonhap did not say what, if any, conditions he set this time. North Korea quit the talks, involving China, Russia, the two Koreas, Japan and the U.S., a year ago and then conducted a nuclear test that drew tightened U.N. sanctions. A return to the talks is likely to go hand-in-hand with new aid, including the implementation of economic agreements reached during a visit by Wen to North Korea last year. Xinhua said Wen told Kim the two enjoyed \\"big potential for developing economic and trade cooperation,\\" singling out the need to speed up development of infrastructure along their borders. China, which sent troops to back North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, already provides most of the aid needed to feed North Korea's malnourished population of 23 million and prop up an economy devastated by natural disasters and chaotic management most recently a currency revaluation that backfired disastrously. Beijing's support for Kim is driven overwhelmingly by its own security concerns, which override any unhappiness it might have over North Korea's nuclear program or rejection of economic reforms, Chinese scholars say. \\"No matter how different its opinions are from those of the North Koreans, and how much unhappiness it has toward them, the Chinese government will not leave North Korea to implode, and it will not let the strategic balance of the Korean peninsula be broken,\\" said Cai Jian, deputy director of the Center for Korean Studies in Shanghai's Fudan University. That, however, comes at the risk of upsetting South Korea, where suspicion is rising that a North Korean torpedo destroyed the naval ship Cheonan in March, killing 46 sailors. North Korea has denied involvement. The timing of Kim's China visit has aroused some complaints among South Korean politicians, who say it shows insensitivity toward the Cheonan victims. South Korean officials have asked that China play a \\"responsible role\\" in the aftermath of the sinking and keep them informed of Kim's activities in China.

Please answer the following question: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.  Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted.

This article offers a simple and effective step-by-step approach to ensure perfect results every time you color your chocolate treats. Step 1: Preparing the Coloring Oil The key to achieving a perfectly mixed colorful chocolate is to warm the coloring oil before adding it to the chocolate. This helps in ensuring that both materials are at a reasonable and consistent temperature, which, in turn, helps in creating a smooth and uniform blend. To start, place the tightly sealed coloring oil in a small zip lock bag. Ensure the bottle is securely sealed, as you don't want any water or air to infiltrate the bag and disturb the oil or cause contamination. Additionally, using a zip lock bag ensures that the label on the bottle stays intact and dry, making it easy to identify the color. Step 2: Warming the Coloring Oil To warm the coloring oil, prepare a bowl with warm water. The water should not be too hot or boiling, as it may damage the oil or cause it to overheat. Once you have the appropriate water temperature, place the plastic bag containing the sealed oil bottle in the bowl with warm water. Allow the oil to sit in the water for 10-15 minutes, which should be enough time to achieve the desired warmth. Step 3: Mixing the Coloring Oil with Chocolate After the oil has warmed up, remove the bottle from the plastic bag. Make sure to dry the exterior of the bottle to prevent any water from entering the chocolate. Before adding the oil to your chocolate, the chocolate should also be warmed or slightly melted to enhance its blendability. Once your chocolate is warmed and ready, slowly add a few drops of the coloring oil to the chocolate. Be careful not to introduce too much oil at once, as this may result in an overpowering color or alter the chocolate's consistency. It's essential to work on one color at a time to maintain control over the process and avoid any mistakes or color contamination. Gently stir the chocolate and oil mixture to ensure a consistent and even distribution of color throughout the chocolate. Conclusion: Following these easy steps will help you turn ordinary chocolate into a vibrant and eye-catching treat with the perfect blend of coloring and flavor. With practice, you can expand your color palette and elevate your chocolate-making skills. The next time you're preparing a batch of chocolate goodies, don't hesitate to add some color to make your creations truly stand out."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is especially true if you talk to people whose businesses you admire. You also may be able to find good recommendations by talking to people in your local chamber of commerce or any trade organizations of which you might be a member. The other answers are incorrect because: (I) This answer is slightly confusing, and it implies conducting an internet search in your contacts, which doesn't make much sense in the context of seeking recommendations for a lawyer. (II) The suggestion to call or email people and offer to compare your list isn't entirely clear and may not be the most effective way to find recommendations. Additionally, the mention of \\"regular business colleagues\\" is confusing in this context. (IV) This answer implies that the experiences and suggestions of the colleagues will make the ultimate decision for you, which may not always be the case. It's important to consider several factors when choosing a business lawyer, not just the advice of your colleagues.

Authorities including the SWAT team rushed to the scene and discovered two people dead from bullet wounds.      According to local CW affiliate KTLA, Moseley and Hayes were identified by Burrel Wilks, a close friend and self-described \\"life coach\\" of Hayes. According to Wilks, the two were married.

Along with starring as Arelly on the VH1 drama series, Moseley has appeared in movies like 2012's Mirror Mirror and 2011's The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1. She also had a small role as Porsche in the 2015 film The Best Thanksgiving Ever.      Moseley's true passion, however, was as a dancer.

Thirty years later, when the story begins, Skeeter is the hotel's handyman while management is held by Kendall (Guy Pearce). Barry's new hotel, the Sunny Vista Nottingham Hotel, is a hit, but he's got plans to build an even more elaborate hotel, one designed around a theme that he's keeping secret. Skeeter's sister and principal of Webster Elementary School, Wendy (Courteney Cox), asks Skeeter to watch her kids, Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) and Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit), while she goes out of town. Skeeter does not know his niece and nephew very well, but agrees. Helping him during the day is Wendy's friend, Jill Hastings (Keri Russell), a teacher who works at the same school as Wendy.

Această discrepanță poate duce la o serie de probleme. În primul rând, acest lucru ar putea avea un impact negativ asupra industriei europene, deoarece companiile europene ar putea fi dezavantajate competitiv în fața concurenței din afara Uniunii. Atunci când consumatorii aleg să cumpere produse importate mai ieftine, datorită faptului că acestea nu sunt fabricate în conformitate cu cele mai ridicate standarde, producătorii europeni pot fi afectați în mod direct. În al doilea rând, acest sistem poate încuraja externalizarea producției și slăbiciunea regulilor de mediu în alte părți ale lumii. Acest lucru ar putea avea un impact negativ asupra mediului și asupra dezvoltării durabile în alte regiuni. Producătorii din țări aflate în afara Uniunii Europene pot alege să profite de diferențele de reglementare și să producă bunuri cu impact ecologic mai mare, eventual poluante, la costuri mai mici datorită lipsa de reglementări similare pe piața lor locală. În al treilea rând, această situație creează un mediu în care consumatorii europeni pot fi induși în eroare. Produsele produse în Europa și cele importate nu sunt întotdeauna etichetate în mod corespunzător pentru a indica originea și nivelul de calitate și protecție a mediului, ceea ce înseamnă că consumatorii nu pot lua întotdeauna decizii informate în ceea ce privește produsele pe care le cumpără. Pentru a aborda aceste probleme, Uniunea Europeană ar trebui să continue să își dezvolte și să își consolideze reglementările în domeniul producției, calității și protecției mediului în ansamblul său, precum și să ia măsuri pentru a asigura transparența și comunicarea corectă a informațiilor către consumatori. Acest lucru ar putea implica implementarea unor standarde și cerințe comune pentru importurile de produse în Uniunea Europeană și adoptarea unui sistem unitar de etichetare și informare a consumatorilor. În concluzie, reglementările și restricțiile de producție în Europa sunt esențiale pentru asigurarea unei concurențe loiale și a unui mediu sustenabil.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents. Chihiro runs back to the river, which was nearly dry when they came over but is now full and large, and she doesn't even recognize the buildings on the far side. As a riverboat approaches, she notices that her body has become transparent.The riverboat lands a big crowd of people in costume -- or maybe they're not people; at first they're only visible as paper masks.

Given the question: Information:  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed...  - Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden. There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease. Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used. In some a joint replacement may be useful. Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected, while in the United States more than 20% of have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is from Greek \\"arthro-\\" meaning joint and \\"-itis\\" meaning inflammation.  - Palindromic rheumatism ( PR ) consists of sudden and rapidly developing attacks of arthritis . There is acute pain , redness , swelling , and disability of one ( usually ) or multiple joints . The interval between recurrent attacks is extremely variable and how long the attack lasts is also variable . There is no joint damage after attacks .  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear...  - Septic arthritis, also known as infectious arthritis or joint infection, is the purulent invasion of a joint by an infectious agent which produces arthritis. People with artificial joints are more at risk than the general population but have slightly different symptoms, are infected with different organisms and require different treatment. Septic arthritis is considered a medical emergency. If untreated, it may destroy the joint in a period of days. The infection may also spread to other parts of the body.  - Replacement arthroplasty (from Greek \\"arthron\\", joint, limb, articulate, + \\"plassein\\", to form, mould, forge, feign, make an image of), or joint replacement surgery, is a procedure of orthopedic surgery in which an arthritic or dysfunctional joint surface is replaced with an orthopedic prosthesis. Joint replacement is considered as a treatment when severe joint pain or dysfunction is not alleviated by less-invasive therapies. During the latter half of the 20th century, rheumasurgery developed as a subspecialty focused on these and a few other procedures in patients with rheumatic diseases.  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected. Causes include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red. Treatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting and the use of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is generally discouraged due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. If...

So it is only natural that most moms and dads will try just about anything, including spending a lot of money -to keep an attack at bay. Trouble is, more than half of parents are trying strategies that simply do not work and wasting hundreds of dollars in the process. According to Dr. Machael Cabana, a pediatrician at the prefix = st1 /UniversityofMichigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, who led the study, one of the most common mistakes was to buy mattress cover to protect against dust mites for a child whose asthma instead was made by plant pollen  . Many of those parents then neglected to do what would have helped a lot more; shut the windows to keep pollen out. Another was using a humidifier for a child who was allergic to dust mites; a humidifier tends to be a place where dust mites like to breed. With those allergies, a dehumidifier works better. Worst of all was the number of smokers with asthmatic children who didn't even try to quit or at least limit themselves to smoking outdoors rather than just moving to another room or the garage. Many smoking parents purchased expensive air filters that have what Cabana called \\" questionable utility. \\" Part of the problem, Dr. Caban and his colleagues believe, is that parents are bombarded by television ads that encourage them to buy products such as air and carpet fresheners, ionizers and other remedies that are often expensive but medically unnecessary. And doctors may not always take the time, or have the time, to explain to parents what will and won't work in their child's particular case. For example, allergies are usually a problem for older children with asthma, while kids 5 and younger more frequently have trouble with viral repiratory infections. So make sure you understand what the cause of your child's asthma really is. Which sentence best explains why TV ads products bombard parents? A) TV ads are obliged to make sure parents understand all terms of their introductory offers. B) TV ads want to be sure that parents understand the benefits of very effective medical aids.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  When Scranton agreed to take on Steamtown, U.S.A., it was estimated that the museum and excursion business would attract 200,000 to 400,000 visitors to the city every year.  In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent.  Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? How do Outback Steakhouses prepare and cook their steaks? How do Outback Steakhouses prepare their steaks?","output":"While both questions deal with the preparation of steaks at Outback Steakhouses, they do differ in the scope of the information being sought.  1. \\"How do Outback Steakhouses prepare and cook their steaks?\\" This question is asking for a detailed and comprehensive explanation of both the preparation process and the cooking methods used for steaks at Outback Steakhouses. This covers aspects such as seasoning, marinating, the choice of cuts, and cooking temperatures, as well as any other factors that contribute to the final product.  To answer this question, let's first look at the preparation process: Outback Steakhouse is known for its signature steaks, which typically come in various cuts including rib-eye, filet, New York strip, and sirloin. The preparation process starts with selecting high-quality cuts of meat, usually sourced from trusted suppliers to ensure the best possible taste and texture. The steaks are then aged to enhance their flavor and tenderness. During the preparation stage, the steaks are seasoned using the restaurant's proprietary blend of 17 spices, which is a closely-guarded secret. This spice blend provides the unique and distinctive flavor Outback Steakhouse is known for. The steaks can also be marinated, if necessary, in a special marinade tailored to each specific cut of meat. Now, let's discuss the cooking process: Outback Steakhouses use a combination of grilling and broiling to cook their steaks. This method sears in the flavors while ensuring that the steaks are cooked to the desired level of doneness. The restaurant uses concept flame grills, which are specifically designed for high-heat cooking. These grills can reach temperatures of up to 650°F (343°C), which allows for a perfect sear and crust on the outside of the steak while maintaining tenderness on the inside.  Customers can request their preferred level of doneness, ranging from rare to well-done, and the steaks are cooked accordingly. The cooking times and temperatures vary depending on factors like the thickness of the steak and the desired level of doneness, but they generally use consistent guidelines to achieve the expected results. 2. \\"How do Outback Steakhouses prepare their steaks?\\" This question is focused on the preparation process and does not explicitly inquire about the cooking methods. It seeks information on factors such as seasoning, the choice of cuts, and any other steps that take place before the actual cooking process begins. To answer this question, a detailed explanation would cover the selection of high-quality cuts of meat and the aging process that enhances the flavor and tenderness of the steaks. Additionally, the answer would mention Outback Steakhouse's proprietary blend of 17 spices used for seasoning and any marination process tailored to specific cuts of meat. In summary, while both questions revolve around the steaks served at Outback Steakhouses, the first question asks for a more comprehensive response that includes both preparation and cooking methods, whereas the second question explicitly focuses on the preparation stage only."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the last of the person who worked closely with a singer to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound? is inside the article: American singer Prudencesa Renfro, professionally known as Pru, was signed through Warner/Chappell Music Publishing by Capitol Records' executive Roy Lott, who said that he was \\"drawn to\\" her songwriting and voice. Jack Ponti, of Cazzy Dog Management, had helped Pru produce a demo tape to secure the record deal. Lott had noted Pru's potential as an artist through her lyrics. He worked closely with her to match her songwriting to the most appropriate sound, serving as the executive producer for her debut studio album Pru.Prior to securing a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in artists such as Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: \\"From a word, I can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis.\\" She considered her music as a form of poetry, citing the album track \\"Hazy Shades\\" as an example of a poem turned into a song.Pru stated that she wanted her songs to bring variety to contemporary R&B, and described the material as the opposite of the formulaic music typically found on radio. On her official website, the singer identified her style as connected with the soul. Though AllMusic gives the singer songwriting credit on twelve of the tracks, Pru is only credited for co-writing \\"Aaroma\\" on the album's liner notes.

After that, a cell reaches a state of \\"senescence\\" or \\"aging\\", where it no longer divides but can still perform its functions.

Truck visits his girlfriend, Annie, who is in jail and wants to leave LA when released. Truck and his partner Jerry Barnes go to collect their bounty from Nate Dinwiddie, a bail bondsman, who refers them to Fogarty, a bail bondsman after a pimp who skipped bail named Gator. The two visit Dorinda, who runs Gator's stable of prostitutes. Truck and Jerry wait for Gator to visit, and chase him, but Gator escapes.  A tip from Truck's friend Duke allows them to locate Gator again, and kill Gator when he attempts to shoot Truck. Dorinda threatens Gator's former whores to keep them in line. Dorinda offers Gator's competing pimps a deal: whoever kills Truck gets to replace Gator while she runs the stable. The only pimp interested in the violence is Harvard Blue. Truck survives several ambushes by Blue's goons.  When Blue points out that Dorinda will not be able to deal with Truck, they agree to share the cost of getting rid of Truck, and Blue will take over more control of Gator's stable.

We want to find out how many toys (d) we have. Now, we have this given information: We have -568 toys in one group and take away 1710 more toys, and that same amount is equal to -758 toys in another group. Let's solve this to find d (the number of toys we have) step-by-step: 1. First, let's add 758*d to both sides of the equation:    -568*d + 758*d - 1710 = -758*d + 758*d    This simplifies to:    190*d - 1710 = 0 2. Now, let's add 1710 to both sides of the equation:    190*d - 1710 + 1710 = 0 + 1710    This simplifies to:    190*d = 1710 3. Finally, let's divide both sides of the equation by 190:    190*d / 190 = 1710 / 190    This simplifies to:    d = 9 So, we found out that we have 9 toys (d=9).

Something that is rude in one country may be quite polite in another. For example, in Britain you mustn't lift your bowl to your mouth when you are having liquid food. That is considered bad manners in Britain. But in Japan you needn't worry about making a noise when you drink something. It shows that you are enjoying it. In Britain we try not to put our hands on the table at all during a meal. In Mexico, however, guests are expected to keep their hands on the table _ a meal. In Arabic countries we must be careful with our hands. You see, in Arabic countries you mustn't eat with your left hand. This is considered to be very impolite.

Please answer the following question: In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them. \\"I hear that you are unhappy,\\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more. Conflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote?

Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

Answer the following question: Around three forty-five on a rainy Saturday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my pager  beeping. As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest  . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, \\" I love you, my dear son.\\" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, \\"I love you.\\" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever.

Here is a news article: And as technology increasingly allows doctors to diagnose problems in a developing fetus, the study underscores remaining risks and hurdles, including developing less-invasive techniques to avoid creating other problems for babies or mothers.      The spina bifida procedure was considered beneficial enough that an independent safety monitoring board stopped the study early so babies scheduled to receive surgery after birth could have access to prenatal surgery.      But there were medical downsides for the women and infants: greater likelihood of being born several weeks earlier than the postnatal group, related breathing problems, and thinning or tearing at women’s surgical incisions, requiring Caesarean sections for later births.      Photo      “While this is a very promising and quite exciting result,” said a study author, Dr. Diana Farmer, surgeon in chief at the Benioff Children’s Hospital at the University of California, San Francisco, “not all the patients were helped here, and there are significant risks. This procedure is not for everyone.”      Conducting the study was itself challenging. Prenatal spina bifida surgery gained attention in the late 1990s when some medical centers, like Vanderbilt University, began performing it. A photograph in which a fetus’s hand appeared to be gripping the finger of a surgeon who had lifted the hand out of the womb was circulated by opponents of abortion rights, further raising the profile.      Leading experts suggested a clinical trial to determine if prenatal surgery was better than postnatal. They insisted on an unusual agreement: that all but three hospitals, in Philadelphia, San Francisco and Nashville, stop doing the procedure.      “There were lots of places that wanted to do it” amid pressure from eager patients, said Dr. Michael Harrison, who pioneered fetal surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, and was a principal investigator for the spina bifida trial before retiring. “But we wanted to make sure it wouldn’t become a freak show. And if you offer treatment outside the trial, you’ll never have a trial because no mother would agree to flip a coin.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Ultimately the other hospitals acceded.      One reason spina bifida researchers wanted a trial was the experience with prenatal surgery for a condition in which the diaphragm has life-threatening abnormalities.      After early efforts to repair the condition prenatally, “we thought we were heroes,” Dr. Harrison said, but realized it worked only for milder cases. Another prenatal approach, forcing the lungs to grow, worked, but caused significantly premature births, making it no better than postnatal treatment, he said. He added that prenatal techniques had improved, becoming less harmful.      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The spina bifida study involved the most severe form, myelomeningocele (MY-ell-oh-men-NING-guh-seal), in which the spine does not close properly and the spinal cord protrudes. Children may experience lower-body paralysis, fluid on the brain, bladder problems and learning disabilities. About one in 3,000 children have that form, said Dr. Alan Guttmacher, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which financed and helped conduct the study.      Many babies now receive surgery to close the spinal opening after birth, but nerve damage from the spinal cord exposure to amniotic fluid remains. Also, the brainstem may be pulled into the spinal column. Excess fluid in the brain may require draining with implanted shunts, which can lead to infection or need repeated surgical replacement.      In the study, about 80 babies were randomly selected for surgery after birth; another 80 had the spinal opening surgically closed in utero, between 19 and 26 weeks of pregnancy. Two in each group died.      Photo      Before surgery, babies in the prenatal group had more severe spinal lesions than the postnatal group, but more in the prenatal group had better results, said a co-author, Dr. Scott Adzick, chief of pediatric surgery at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.      Those who received prenatal surgery were half as likely to have a shunt, and eight times as likely to have a normally positioned brainstem. There was “much better motor function of the legs,” Dr. Adzick said, and at 30 months old, nearly twice as many walked without crutches or orthotics.      Although they were born at 34 weeks of pregnancy on average, compared with 37 weeks for the postnatal group, there was no difference in cognitive development, said Dr. Catherine Spong, chief of pregnancy and perinatology at the child health institute.      Dr. Adzick said prenatal surgery may “stop exposure of the developing spinal cord and perhaps avert further neurological damage” or stop the leak of spinal fluid that causes brainstem problems.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Results were dramatic for Tyson Thomas, of Stansbury Park, Utah, now 22 months old. His mother, Jessica Thomas, a study participant, said doctors had described his brain malformation as “the worst they had ever seen” and said “it would be likely that he wouldn’t be able to breathe on his own.”      Since birth at 35 weeks gestation, she said, Tyson breathes independently, shows no brainstem malformation and is starting to talk. Bladder nerve damage will require him to urinate through catheters all his life. He now uses a walker and a foot brace, but is “getting really close to walking” on his own, said Ms. Thomas, a nurse.      Researchers will follow the children from ages 6 to 9 to see if benefits continue.      Several experts said they would now mention prenatal surgery as one option for some women. But since many women were excluded from the study, including those who were severely obese or whose babies’ conditions did not fit certain specifications, many may be ineligible.      The study should not propel surgeons to “run around and start doing this” for other conditions, said Dr. Terry Buchmiller, a fetal medicine expert at Children’s Hospital Boston who was not involved in the research. “I can go in utero right now and fix a cleft lip, but I don’t think anybody is saying we ought to do that, because of the risk.”      But she called the study “a wonderful, almost several-decade journey of trying to improve the outcomes of a debilitating condition,” adding, “This looks to be potentially life-changing.” ||||| A Birth-Defect Breakthrough: Prenatal Spinal Surgery      It's a landmark in the controversial, 30-year-old field of fetal surgery: Surgeons are reporting success in treating a common, serious birth defect called spina bifida — before birth.      Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Tara and Jake Hallman Courtesy of Tara and Jake Hallman      Spina bifida is a hole in the spine that sometimes allows a loop of the naked spinal cord to protrude outside the body. Such neural-tube defects are down 30 percent because more expectant mothers are taking folic acid pills and dietary supplements. But about 1,500 babies are born with spina bifida every year, and many are destined to have severe lifelong disabilities.      A new study, published online in the New England Journal of Medicine, shows that repairing the most severe form of spina bifida during pregnancy can reduce the paralysis and brain damage that often result when the defect isn't corrected until after birth.      The surgery is delicate and risky for both mother and fetus. Doctors must make a three-inch incision in the mother's uterus to expose the fetus, which is typically about four inches long at this stage. They then put the exposed piece of spinal cord — between the size of a raisin and an almond — back where it belongs, and suture layers of tissue to keep it in place and prevent cerebrospinal fluid from leaking out.      The study of 183 pregnancies shows that children who had the spinal operation in utero were twice as likely to walk unaided later. At age 3, 42 percent of those who had the prenatal operation were walking by themselves versus 21 percent of those who had the surgery after birth.      This is the first time that fetal surgery has ever been attempted and validated for what we think of as a non-fatal birth defect.      Brett Hallman is in the lucky group. When he was a 25-week fetus, he was the 55th patient who had fetal surgery for severe spina bifida at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.      Brett's mother, Tara Hallman, says she and her husband Jake knew the operation was a success months later, when Brett smiled, sat up and crawled on schedule.      \\"When he walked at 17 months without any braces — without anything — it just took my breath away,\\" Brett's mom says.      A Landmark Study      But doctors who treat spina bifida say there's something even more important: Fetal surgery reduces a child's need for a lifelong shunt — a tube to carry cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to the abdomen. Without the shunt, fluid can build up, causing devastating brain damage or death.      More than 80 percent of the children who had the surgery after birth needed shunts, compared to 40 percent among those operated on prenatally.      Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Tara and Jake Hallman Courtesy of Tara and Jake Hallman      \\"From a medical point of view — even though walking is quite nice — for the long-term overall outlook for these children, being free of a shunt is probably the single most important aspect,\\" says Diana Farmer, a study coauthor and chief of pediatric surgery at the University of California at San Francisco.      Farmer says the new study is a landmark for the field.      \\"This is the first time that fetal surgery has ever been attempted and validated for what we think of as a non-fatal birth defect,\\" Farmer says.      Since surgeons at UCSF first did fetal surgery three decades ago, the field has been controversial. \\"People thought it was quite a heretical thing to do, and quite risky for women,\\" farmer says. \\"Prior to this, we only considered fetal surgery in a circumstance where either the fetus would not survive pregnancy or the baby would be likely to die soon after birth.\\"      But she thinks the tide is beginning to turn — partly because other procedures, such as donation of part of a liver from a living relative, \\"have demonstrated that it is ethically reasonable in certain circumstances for someone to undergo a medical procedure for altruism, essentially — to help someone else.\\"      'Not A Cure'      But Scott Adzick of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, lead author of the new study, stresses that fetal surgery for spina bifida \\"is not a cure. We think that we can help kids.\\"      There were some downsides: Nearly four out of five babies in the fetal surgery group were delivered prematurely, compared to 15 percent among those who got the operation after birth. So the fetal surgery group had more respiratory distress and other complications of prematurity. But there were no more deaths in one group versus the other.      One of the biggest risks is to the moms. Surgery weakens the uterus, which could cause a disastrous uterine rupture if the woman goes into labor, though this didn't happen during the study. The uterine incision also means that all subsequent babies will have to be born by caesarean section.      And as Tara Hallman testifies, even the most successful outcomes of fetal surgery aren't perfect. Although Brett is now an active 7-year-old who swims and plays other sports, he has to work to keep up physically.      And he has some bladder and bowel problems — but nothing, his mother says, that can't be managed. For instance, Brett can't urinate normally, so he's learned to insert a catheter every few hours.      Tara Hallman says he hasn't let his condition get him down. \\"Everybody has their challenges in life, and everybody has their battle scars, as we call them,\\" she says. \\"This is his. And it's something that he's actually very proud of. He loves to show people his scar. It's actually part of his identity.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that repairing the most severe form of spina bifida during pregnancy can reduce paralysis and brain damage that often result when the defect isn't corrected until after birth.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"Political science is a late arrival in terms of social sciences[citation needed].\\" answer the question \\"Where did the ideas of political science begin?\\"","output":"No, the sentence \\"Political science is a late arrival in terms of social sciences[citation needed].\\" does not answer the question \\"Where did the ideas of political science begin?\\" The sentence only provides information about the relative development of political science compared to other social sciences but does not offer any details regarding its origins. To answer the question, a more thorough explanation of the historical development and the roots of political ideas is needed. The origin of political science can be traced back to ancient civilizations, particularly to the works of Greek philosophers such as Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle. These early philosophers have contributed much to the development of political thought and theories. Throughout history, there have been numerous political thinkers who have developed and expanded on these early ideas, leading to the multifaceted subject we know as political science today. Ancient and classical political thought Political science began in ancient Greece around the 5th century BCE with the development of political philosophy. Socrates, considered by many as the father of political philosophy, engaged in dialogues questioning the nature of society, law, and politics. Plato, Socrates' student, wrote dialogues like \\"The Republic,\\" in which he introduced the concept of a philosopher-king and expounded on the nature of justice, political systems, and ideal states. Aristotle, a student of Plato, wrote \\"Politics,\\" a treatise where he examined the concept of state, emphasizing natural law, the ideals of democracy and oligarchy, and the importance of the middle class in maintaining balance within a political system. Medieval political thought During the medieval period, political thought was largely influenced by Christianity and its teachings. Key figures like St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas have incorporated Christian perspectives into their political philosophies. St. Augustine's \\"City of God\\" discussed the duality of the earthly city (the temporal realm) and the heavenly city (eternal divine realm) and further explored the role of government in maintaining the earthly city. St. Thomas Aquinas, another prominent medieval political philosopher, drew upon the works of Aristotle and integrated natural law into Christian thought in his \\"Summa Theologiae.\\" Renaissance political thought During the Renaissance in Europe, a renewed interest in the ancient Greek and Roman writings led to new interpretations of political ideas. Niccolo Machiavelli, an Italian diplomat and political theorist, challenged conventional political thought with \\"The Prince,\\" which advocated for the pragmatic and ruthless pursuit of power by political leaders. Additionally, Thomas More's \\"Utopia\\" explored the concept of an ideal society, examining the relationship between social equality, property, and political power. Enlightenment political thought The Enlightenment was an intellectual movement in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries that emphasized the power of reason and empirical evidence in understanding the world. Political thinkers from this period, often known as the \\"philosophes\\", advocated for separation of powers, constitutionalism, and the rule of law, laying the foundation for modern democracies. Notable figures include John Locke, who defended the concept of a social contract between the government and the governed in his \\"Two Treatises of Government;\\" Montesquieu, who highlighted the importance of separation of powers in \\"The Spirit of the Laws;\\" and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who explored the relationship between individual liberty and political authority in \\"The Social Contract.\\" Contemporary political science Modern political science has evolved from these earlier political thoughts, incorporating empirical and theoretical analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of political systems, political behavior, political theories, and international relations. It draws upon multiple approaches, including historical analysis, comparative politics, quantitative and qualitative methodologies, to investigate and explain political phenomena. Major contributions have come from philosophers and theorists like John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Thomas Hobbes, Max Weber, John Maynard Keynes, and Hannah Arendt, among others. In conclusion, the ideas of political science originated in ancient Greece and were expanded upon by political thinkers throughout history, spanning various cultures and time periods. The development of political thought and the origins of political science encompass a diverse and rich tapestry of intellectual contributions from the ancient world to the present-day global context."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Today, we are going to learn about something important happening at a hospital called Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. This hospital is in a city called Aberdeen, which is in a country called Scotland.  Hospitals are places where we go when we're feeling sick or when we need a doctor to help us feel better. We trust hospitals to take good care of us when we need them. That's why it is important for the people in charge of hospitals to make sure they are doing the best job possible. At the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, there is going to be a special check-up. No, it's not like the ones we get when we visit the doctor. It's a check-up on the hospital's own care for their patients. This check-up is called an \\"independent review.\\" This means that a group of people from outside the hospital will visit and see how well the hospital is taking care of people who are not feeling well. These special visitors will look at lots of different parts of the hospital. They'll talk to the doctors and nurses and other people who work there. They might even talk to some of the patients, who are people staying in the hospital because they're sick. The visitors will ask questions and learn about how the hospital is working to help the patients feel better. After the special visitors have finished looking at everything, they will give some helpful advice. They might say, \\"Great job!\\" Lots of things are going really well, and the hospital should keep doing them. They might also say, \\"Here are some things you can improve.\\" This means they noticed some things that the hospital could be doing even better to help take care of patients. This independent review is a good thing because it helps make sure that the hospital is doing the best it can to take care of people who feel sick.

Berg village dealt with many traffic casualties because of narrower streets and lanes, While Hill village had wide streets, more traffic signals and a greater number of cyclists.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which village is managing traffic more efficiently?  Hint: Turner et al (2006) derived crash prediction models for this report’s predecessor and found a pronounced ‘safety in numbers’ effect in the models. Using the crash prediction model for mid-block locations, generic motorist and cyclist volumes can be used to demonstrate the impacts on the expected crash rate of varying motor vehicle and cycle volumes. As shown in figure 2.20, an increase in the proportion of cyclists to the overall traffic volume causes an increase in expected crashes at mid-block locations, but the crash rate increases at a decreasing rate. That is to say, the crash rate per cyclist goes down as the cycle volume increases. A:","output":"According to the given information, Hill Village manages traffic more efficiently. This conclusion is based on the following factors: 1. Wider Streets - Hill Village has wider streets compared to Berry Village. Wider streets allow for better traffic flow and reduce congestion. This factor contributes positively to traffic management, as it facilitates smoother movement and reduces the chances of collisions between vehicles, including bicycles. 2. More Traffic Signals - Hill Village has a greater number of traffic signals than Berg Village, which means that the flow of traffic is better regulated. Traffic signals help in the orderly movement of vehicles and ensure the proper allocation of right of way. This reduces the chances of accidents and contributes to the efficiency of traffic management. 3. Safety in Numbers Effect - According to Turner et al. (2006), there's a 'safety in numbers' effect in crash prediction models. This means that the crash rate per cyclist decreases when the number of cyclists increases. Hill Village has a greater number of cyclists compared to Berg Village, which suggests that the crash rate per cyclist is lower in Hill Village. 4. Crash Rate Increases at a Decreasing Rate - The crash prediction model for mid-block locations, as mentioned in the hint, shows that an increase in the proportion of cyclists to the overall traffic volume causes an increase in expected crashes, but the crash rate increases at a decreasing rate. This means that as the number of cyclists increases, the risk of each cyclist being involved in an accident decreases. Considering these factors, we can conclude that Hill Village is managing traffic more efficiently than Berg Village.
