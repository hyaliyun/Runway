Stephen Gough lost an appeal against a conviction for the breach of an Asbo. He appeared from Winchester Prison where he is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for breaching the order banning him from being naked in public. His counsel Matthew Scott argued Gough should have been allowed to appear naked at the original trial. Lady Justice Rafferty refused Gough's appeal. Clive Coleman, the BBC's legal affairs correspondent, said Gough, 56, almost certainly made legal history by appearing in his natural state. Gough was found guilty by a jury at Winchester Crown Court of breaching the Asbo in October 2014 and sentenced to 30 months imprisonment. He had refused to put on clothes as he left Winchester Prison after being imprisoned for a previous breach. At his trial, the judge refused his requests to appear naked and he was tried in his absence. Mr Scott argued at the Court of Appeal the judge should have made arrangements to allow the trial to take place with the defendant present, but naked. On the video link, he appeared seated and naked at the prison, with his lower half obscured by a table.

Given the question: Process:  - Skin is cut or damaged - Bacteria enters through the wound - The bacteria reproduces and spreads - Causes symptoms - The bacteria is either fought off or becomes a disease.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose wound is disinfected happens, how will it affect more bacteria reproduces.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of disinfecting a wound can have a direct effect on the process of bacteria reproducing and spreading, which may lead to a decrease in the likelihood of infection and disease. When a wound is disinfected, an antiseptic solution is applied to the area, which helps to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms present in the wound. This can be achieved through various mechanisms, such as the disruption of bacterial cell walls or by targeting proteins essential for their replication. By disinfecting a wound, the following effects can be observed on the process: 1. Reduction of bacteria: Disinfecting the wound with an antiseptic solution can significantly reduce the number of bacteria present in the wound, potentially preventing them from reproducing and spreading to a level that causes problems. 2. Inhibition of bacterial growth: The disinfecting agent may not only kill bacteria but also inhibit their growth, making it more difficult for the remaining bacteria to reproduce and spread. Consequently, this increases the chance that the body's immune system can effectively deal with the bacteria before it becomes a problem. 3. Reduced symptoms and faster healing: With fewer bacteria present to cause infection and inflammation, the associated symptoms such as redness, swelling, and pain may be less severe. As a result, the wound may heal more quickly, reducing the likelihood of complications. 4. Prevention of disease: By reducing the overall bacterial load in the wound and inhibiting the growth of remaining bacteria, proper disinfection can play a crucial role in ensuring that a wound does not lead to a more severe infection or disease. In conclusion, the perturbation of wound disinfection has a direct effect on the process of bacterial reproduction and spread, reducing the overall bacterial load, inhibiting bacterial growth, and ultimately assisting in the prevention of infections and diseases. This is why it is essential to thoroughly clean and disinfect wounds, especially in cases of open injuries or potential exposure to harmful bacteria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After receiving an unexpected phone call that she has won a spot to participate on a television game show, she becomes obsessed with regaining the youthful appearance she possesses in an old photograph. To reach her goal, she goes to a doctor to discuss weight loss. The doctor gives her a prescription for weight-loss amphetamine pills throughout the day and a sedative at night. As the months go by, Sara's tolerance for the pills adjusts and as a result she is no longer able to feel the same high the pills once gave her. When her invitation does not arrive, she increases her dosage from double to triple and, as a result, begins to suffer from amphetamine psychosis.

William Ben Hogan (August 13, 1912 - July 25, 1997) was an American professional golfer who is generally considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game. He was born within six months of Sam Snead and Byron Nelson, who were two other acknowledged golf greats of the 20th century. Hogan is notable for his profound influence on golf swing theory and his legendary ball-striking ability. His nine career professional major championships tie him with Gary Player for fourth all-time, trailing only Jack Nicklaus (18), Tiger Woods (14) and Walter Hagen (11). Hogan was born in Stephenville, Texas, the third and youngest child of Chester and Clara (Williams) Hogan. His father was a blacksmith and the family lived ten miles southwest in Dublin until 1921, when they moved 70 miles (112 km) northeast to Fort Worth. When Hogan was nine years old in 1922, his father Chester committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot at the family home. By some accounts, Chester committed suicide in front of him, which some (including Hogan biographer James Dodson) have cited as the cause of his introverted personality in later years.  The family incurred financial difficulties after his father's suicide, and the children took jobs to help their seamstress mother make ends meet. Older brother Royal quit school at age 14 to deliver office supplies by bicycle, and nine-year-old Ben sold newspapers after school at the nearby train station. A tip from a friend led him to caddying at the age of 11 at Glen Garden Country Club, a nine-hole course seven miles (11 km) to the south. One of his fellow caddies at Glen Garden was Byron Nelson, later a tour rival. The two would tie for the lead at the annual Christmas caddie tournament in December 1927, when both were 15. Nelson sank a 30-foot putt to tie on the ninth and final hole. Instead of sudden death, they played another nine holes; Nelson sank another substantial putt on the final green to win by a stroke.  The following spring, Nelson was granted the only junior membership offered by the members of Glen Garden. Club rules did not allow caddies age 16 and older, so after August 1928, Hogan took his game to three scrubby daily-fee courses: Katy Lake, Worth Hills, and Z-Boaz. Where did he grow up?","output":"William Ben Hogan grew up in Texas. He was born in Stephenville, and his family later moved to Dublin and then to Fort Worth.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the premise \\"I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Secrecy is not required at any time. \\" is true?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that the statement \\"Secrecy is not required at any time\\" is true based on the premise \\"I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being.\\" The premise, \\"I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being,\\" indicates that the person speaking or writing believes that secrecy is important in the current context or at this specific time. The phrase \\"for the time being\\" has temporal connotations and refers to a temporary state of affairs or a situation that is currently in place but may change in the future. This suggests that the person believes that secrecy is required under certain circumstances or during a specific period of time. On the other hand, the statement \\"Secrecy is not required at any time\\" is an absolute proposition. It implies that there is never a need or requirement for secrecy, and this is a universal condition that applies regardless of the situation or circumstances. These two statements, therefore, convey differing viewpoints on the need for secrecy. The original premise argues for the need for secrecy in certain instances or under certain conditions, while the subsequent hypothesis denies any need for secrecy at any time. So, these two statements are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the original premise is true, then the subsequent hypothesis cannot be true, and vice versa. As a result, if we accept the original premise that \\"I should have to request absolute secrecy for the time being,\\" we cannot also accept the hypothesis that \\"Secrecy is not required at any time.\\" In this respect, it's critical to recognize that the concept of \\"secrecy\\" is not always absolute but can be situational and context-specific. The need for secrecy can change based on a variety of factors such as what is at stake, who is involved, the implications of disclosure, and so forth.  A more plausible scenario might be to revise the hypothesis to reflect that there may be times when secrecy is not required or relevant, but there could also be circumstances where it is needed, conforming to the premise more accurately. Instead of an unqualified \\"Secrecy is not required at any time\\", the hypothesis could say, \\"Secrecy may not be required at all times\\" which doesn't directly counter the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: You are given a new situation: Rob is experimenting with how air pressure works. To that end, he has designed two tests. In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations.  and a hint : Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track.  Please answer this question : Would case A have higher or lower air pressure above it than case B? The answer is:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the given information. - In case A (airplane wing) air flows more quickly above the wing, resulting in lower air pressure above the wing. - In case B (race car spoiler) air flows more slowly above the spoiler, resulting in higher air pressure above it. Step 2: Compare air pressure above in both cases. - Air pressure above case A (airplane wing) is lower. - Air pressure above case B (race car spoiler) is higher. Step 3: Conclude the answer based on comparison. The answer is: Case A has lower air pressure above it than Case B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","output":"To answer this elaborate question, we must first discuss the origins and background of both Trent Reznor and Shout Out Louds. By analyzing their respective countries of origin, we can then determine if the two are from the same country. Trent Reznor, whose full name is Michael Trent Reznor, is a prominent American musician, composer, singer, songwriter, and producer. He was born on May 17, 1965, in New Castle, Pennsylvania, United States. Reznor is best known as the founder, lead vocalist, and principal songwriter of Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band that has gained significant fame and acclaim since its inception in 1988. Aside from his work in Nine Inch Nails, Reznor has also collaborated with numerous other artists and bands and has ventured into the world of film scoring with his work on successful films such as \\"The Social Network\\" (2010), \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" (2011), and \\"Gone Girl\\" (2014), among others. This showcases that Trent Reznor's origin is the United States. Shout Out Louds, on the other hand, is an indie-pop band hailing from Stockholm, Sweden. The band was formed in 2001 and consists of Adam Olenius (vocals, guitar), Ted Malmros (bass), Carl von Arbin (guitar), Eric Edman (drums), and Bebban Stenborg (keyboards, accordion, glockenspiel, moog, vocals). Shout Out Louds gained international recognition with their debut album, \\"Howl Howl Gaff Gaff\\" (2003), which featured a unique blend of catchy melodies and thought-provoking lyrics. The band's music is often characterized by its playful, upbeat sound with strong influences from 80's and 90's indie rock groups. Shout Out Louds have continued to be active in the music scene, and released their latest album, \\"Ease My Mind\\" (2017), showcasing their consistent growth and musical evolution. As mentioned previously, the Shout Out Louds band is from Sweden. Now, considering the information presented above, we can conclude that Trent Reznor and Shout Out Louds are not from the same country. Reznor is an American musician originating from the United States, while Shout Out Louds is a Swedish band with roots firmly placed in Stockholm, Sweden. Although both artists belong to the broader spectrum of alternative rock, their backgrounds showcase the diverse range of geographical influences within the genre.

Summarize this article: Figures obtained by BBC Wales show South Wales Fire and Rescue Service recorded the highest number of delays - 460 - since January 2013. Reasons included access problems and being sent in the wrong direction. Firefighter David Bound told the BBC delays were \\"a daily occurrence, sometimes several times a day\\". Mid and west Wales firefighters were delayed just 11 times in three years and the north Wales service 57 times. Crews across Wales have tackled more than 9,000 fires since January 2013. The main reason for delays was access problems, with firefighters held up 364 times, and there were 114 delays due to crews not being able to find the blaze. Firefighters were sent in the wrong direction 47 times and on three occasions \\"civil disturbances\\" held up crews in south Wales. Mr Bound, watch manager at Tonypandy in Rhondda Cynon Taff, said access problems happened daily. \\"Engines are quite long and wide and some streets are so narrow, with cars parked. Once we arrive we have got to get the equipment and get out of the fire engine ourselves. \\"We understand it's difficult for people to park by their own houses but [it would help] if more people did think to acknowledge tight corners in their locality. \\"Delays because of access are a daily occurrence, sometimes several times a day.\\" Mr Bound said poor or a lack of directions can also cause problems. \\"We had a call recently for Penrhys and the only information we had was 'Penrhys estate' so the vehicle had to search through the estate for the fire. \\"We will always attend as quickly as we can, and force entry quite quickly. \\"But if there is a delay for whatever reason it delays us in our duties which could have an impact on people's lives.\\" The number of delays fell over the three years in south and north Wales, but rose in mid and west Wales. Firefighters in south Wales were delayed 187 times in 2013, 138 times in 2014 and the most recent figure for 2015 was 135. In north Wales there were 26 delays in 2013, which dropped to 14 by 2015. Mid and west Wales fighters were delayed just once in 2013 and five times in 2014 and 2015. Some parts of Wales - including Carmarthenshire - did not record any delays in three years while Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire only recorded one each. Summary:","output":"Figures from BBC Wales reveal that the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service recorded the highest number of delays, 460, since January 2013. The main reason for the delays was access problems, with firefighters being held up 364 times.

Article: New archaeological discovers suggest that trade between Europe and Asia along the Silk Road probably began in some form many countries earlier than once thought. The findings, _ with a widening range of scientific and historical research, could add a fascinating new page to the epic of the Silk Road. The latest and most surprising discovery is pieces of silk found in the hair of an Egyptian mummy from about 1000 BC, long before regular traffic on the Silk Road and at least one thousand years before silk was previously thought to be used in Egypt. Other research may extend human activity along this route back even further, perhaps a million years to the migration of human ancestors into eastern Asia. The official origin of East-West commerce along the road is usually placed in the late 2nd century BC when an agent of the Chinese Emperor Wu-di returned from a dangerous secret mission across the desert into the remote high country of Central Asia. The agent, Zhang Qian, travelled as far as Afghanistan and brought back knowledge of even more distant lands such as Persia, Syria and a place known as Lijien, perhaps Rome. Historians have called this one of the most important journeys in ancient times. His journey opened the way for what have been thought to be the first indirect contacts between the ancient world's two superpowers, China and Rome. Chinese silk, first traded to central Asian tribes for war horses and to the Parthians of old Persia in exchange for acrobats and ostrich eggs, was soon finding its way through a network of merchants to the luxury markets of Rome. But the new discoveries show that Chinese silk was apparently present in the West long before the Han emperor started organized trade over the Silk Road. The research could change thinking about the early history of world trade and provide insights into the mystery of just how and when Europe and the Mediterranean lands first became aware of the glorious culture at the other end of Eurasia. Question: The silk thread found in the hair of an Egyptian mummy suggests that   _  .

Sentence 1: you've never seen the great American desert Sentence 2: I saw the photos you took of the great American desert. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Step 1: Understand the two sentences. Sentence 1 states that \\"you\\" have never seen the great American desert. Sentence 2 states that \\"I\\" (the speaker) saw the photos \\"you\\" took of the great American desert. Step 2: Analyze if the second sentence logically follows from the first sentence. The first sentence implies that the person being addressed has not personally seen the great American desert. However, this does not prevent the possibility that this person took photos of the desert without directly seeing it (perhaps using a camera mounted on a drone or relying on someone else to take the photos). The second sentence implies that the person being addressed did indeed take photos of the desert, which could be true even if they have not personally seen the desert. Conclusion: The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as the information provided by the sentences is not contradictory, but also does not necessarily imply the second sentence based on the first. The two sentences can coexist, but one does not logically result from the other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ned Ravine, who is both a police officer and lawyer (who often defends the people he arrests), believes that he knows everything about women, and says that he will throw away his badge if anyone ever proves him wrong. While on a stakeout, he encounters a seductive woman named Lola Cain; the next day, Lola shows up at his law office, saying that she needs him to look over some papers she has come across. Meanwhile, Max Shady, who was just released from prison after seven years, starts stalking Ned, planning to kill him for failing to successfully defend Max in court. Ned's wife Lana and her car mechanic Frank, with whom she is having an affair, start plotting to kill Ned in order to collect on his accident insurance, which has a triple indemnity rider; if Ned is shot, falls from a northbound train, and drowns in a freshwater stream, Lana will collect nine million dollars. Lola gets Ned to come to her house to examine the \\"papers\\", which are actually a laundry receipt and an expired lottery ticket, and the two of them end up having sex in various wild ways. The next morning, Ned says that they can never do that again because he loves his wife; this drives Lola to start stalking Ned. A few days later, Ned takes the train to go to a legal symposium; Lana and Frank are also on the train, and so is Max.

Sentence 1 conveys affirmation (\\"yeah\\") and states that something exists or occurs (\\"there are\\").

Alvin takes the lead, and then begins to show off, and Dave (Jason Lee) calls him over and tells him to stop it. He reminds him that this is a charity event, and not all about Alvin, and to stop it, but Alvin refuses. He slings the cord to his electric guitar over a high beam, and swings over the crowd while playing his guitar. Inadvertently, Alvin's cord knocks a huge Alvin-cutout loose, and it hits Dave. Dave is taken to the hospital, and is covered in gauze, a neck brace, and traction and casts on every limb.Before going under sedation, Dave tells the chipmunks that Aunt Jackie (the one Theodore calls Popcorn Jackie since she sends them popcorn) will take care of them, and that he has arranged for them to go to school.

They convey different information about the relationship between the river Geamărtălui and the Strâmba River in Romania. 1. In the first sentence: \\"The river Geamărtălui is a tributary of the Strâmba River in Romania.\\" This sentence suggests that the river Geamărtălui is a smaller river that flows into the larger Strâmba River. In geographical terms, a tributary refers to a river or stream that flows into a larger river, adding to its volume. In this case, the Geamărtălui River is the tributary, and the Strâmba River is the main river.  2. In the second sentence: \\"The Strâmba River is a tributary of the River Geamărtălui in Romania.\\" This sentence reverses the roles of the two rivers, stating that the Strâmba River is the tributary that flows into the Geamărtălui River. This means that the Strâmba River is the smaller river in this case and the Geamărtălui River is the main river. Therefore, these two sentences do not convey the same information. They establish different relationships between the rivers Geamărtălui and Strâmba, with one sentence indicating that Geamărtălui is a tributary of Strâmba, and the other sentence stating the opposite. It's essential to verify the correct relationship between these two rivers to determine the accurate description of their connection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Malice Movie plot: Andy (Bill Pullman) and Tracy Safian (Nicole Kidman) are a newlywed couple living in a Victorian house that they are restoring in Western Massachusetts. He is an Associate Dean at a local college, while his wife teaches art to children. When a student is attacked and seriously wounded by a serial rapist, Dr. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), a brilliant surgeon who has recently joined the staff of the area hospital, operates and saves her life. Money is tight, so Andy invites him to rent the third floor of their home, in order to finance the new plumbing. With his propensity to bring home sexual partners and to party late into the night, Jed quickly proves himself to be a less-than-ideal tenant. When Paula Bell (Gwyneth Paltrow), one of Andy's students, is attacked and killed by the serial rapist, Andy is the one to find her body, prompting police Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) to view him as a possible suspect. Harris asks Andy to come to the police station and submit a semen sample to clear his name. While at the police station, Andy learns that Tracy has been hospitalized and is being operated on by Jed. In removing one of Tracy's ovaries, which has ruptured due to a cyst, Jed discovers Tracy is pregnant, but the stress of the procedure causes the fetus to abort. Another doctor notices that Tracy's other ovary is torsed and appears necrotic. Jed consults with Andy and advises him to agree to the removal of Tracy's second ovary, rather than risk her life. Andy painfully agrees, since this will mean that Tracy can never have children. Jed overrules the protests of other doctors that the ovary might still be healthy and he removes it. After the removal, it is confirmed that the ovary was, in fact, healthy. With this knowledge, Tracy and Andy decide to sue Jed and the hospital.

Write some highlights for the following article: Scientist David O'Reilly, who works for the tobacco industry, said nicotine makes your brain work better. A scientist employed by one of the biggest cigarette manufacturers today said nicotine is good for your health. Group scientific director for British American Tobacco, which makes Benson & Hedges, Dunhill and Lucky Strikes, David O'Reilly has been branded 'irresponsible' and accused of telling just part of the story. He told the Sunday Times Magazine smoking helps a person's brain work more effectively, adding: 'It helps with cognition, stimulation and relaxes.' His controversial claim came just a week after New York University researchers warned smokers of ecigarettes could inhale more nicotine than those who smoke regular cigarettes. Mr O'Reilly said likened taking a puff from an ecigarette to drinking a cup of coffee, as he claimed the practise was safe. But the senior molecular biologist has come under fire from health experts, who have accused him of trying to help 'sell as many cigarettes as possible'. Professor John Britton, chairman of the Royal College of Physicians tobacco advisory group and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham, said one hit of nicotine can have positive effects on the brain. But he warned the drug is highly addictive, leaving smokers needing to get their hit to enable their brains to function normally. 'It is true that in a single use,. nicotine probably does improve concentration and hand-eye co-ordination,. on a par with what you get from caffeine,' he said. Health expert Professor John Britton claimed Mr O'Reilly's claim was 'irresponsible' accusing him of trying to 'sell more cigarettes' 'But it is also a powerfully addictive drug, and there comes a time when you need nicotine just for your brain to function normally.' A spokesman for BAT, said the company 'absolutely' stood by Mr O'Reilly's statement. He said Mr O'Reilly had not advised the drug was good for you in the sense of keeping well hydrated. A spokeswoman for Cancer Research added: ' We don't fully understand the long-term effects of nicotine use.'

Mike Glover, who has managed the bridge project for the decade since it was first approved, told the BBC its design would make it easy to maintain. The new 1.7 miles (2.7km) crossing over the river Forth will open to traffic for the first time on Wednesday. It will take most of the vehicles that currently travel over the 53-year-old Forth Road Bridge. The existing suspension bridge will be adapted to be used by lighter traffic such as cycles, pedestrians and public transport. Mr Glover told the BBC Radio Four documentary Gordon Goes Forth that despite the Forth Road Bridge being replaced because of issues about its safety and reliability, it could last another 50 years if it was properly maintained. Wednesday 30 August At about 01:00, the Queensferry Crossing will fully open to traffic in both directions. Police will put in a place a rolling roadblock to stop traffic driving across the Forth Road Bridge and will redirect them across the Queensferry Crossing. The northbound carriageway will be opened first. The southbound carriageway will be opened about 45 minutes later. The bridge will be fully open to traffic for the rest of the day and the following day. Friday 1 September At about 01:00 the Queensferry Crossing will close to all traffic. Police will redirect all vehicles back across the Forth Road Bridge. It will remain closed until the early hours of Wednesday morning Saturday 2 and Sunday 3 September About 50,000 members of the public, who were given tickets after a ballot, will get a \\"once in a lifetime\\" chance to walk over the new bridge on Saturday and Sunday. The Queen will officially open the Queensferry Crossing. She will be joined by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will bless the bridge, and the Queen will cut a ribbon on the south side. Tuesday 5 September A chance for a further 10,000 local people and school children to walk the bridge. Wednesday 6 September The bridge will re-open to traffic, with no pedestrian access. The initial speed limit will be 40mph but after work has been completed to adapt the Forth Road Bridge public transport will be switched back to the old bridge and the Queensferry Crossing will become a 70 mph motorway. The current Forth Road Bridge opened in 1964 but a serious problem was found with corrosion of the wires inside its cables not long after its 40th birthday. The corrosion meant that the bridge's cables had already lost about 10% of their strength and it was forecast that it might not be able to take the heavy loads for much more than a decade. The decision to replace it was taken in 2007, with construction of the new crossing beginning in September 2011. Mr Glover, who has been the technical director of the Queensferry Crossing since 2007, calls it a \\"world class bridge\\" which will be around well into the 22nd Century. He said: \\"The length of time this bridge will be in position will be well in excess of 120 years - 150 years.\\" The civil engineer said there were two main reasons for predicting such longevity. \\"The first is that the exterior of the bridge is a continuous structure - it is a box - which means the level of maintenance that is required is very minimal, unlike the trusses on the current suspension bridge,\\" Mr Glover said. \\"The second is because the individual cables that make up the cable-stay bridge each one can be replaced without the stability of the bridge being in doubt. \\"Whereas with the suspension bridge any problem with that suspension cable means that the bridge would have to be closed.\\" Despite the problems with the existing Forth Road Bridge, Mr Glover predicted it could survive for another 50 years now that it would be carrying lighter loads. He says: \\"It does require the maintenance regime to be maintained but with modern instrumentation we will know where to look for issues.\\" The documentary Gordon goes Forth, presented by Gordon Brown, will be on BBC Radio Four at 20:00 on Monday 28 August. This article was about:","output":"This article discusses the new 1.7-mile crossing over the River Forth, managed by Mike Glover.

It could last another 50 years with proper maintenance. The Queensferry Crossing will fully open to traffic, starting with the northbound carriageway, on August 30. However, the bridge will close from September 1 until the early hours of September 6 for various events including a public walkover, an official opening by Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh, and further walks by local people and school children. The initial speed limit on the Queensferry Crossing will be 40mph, increasing to 70mph after adjustments have been made to the Forth Road Bridge to accommodate public transport. Mike Glover, technical director of the Queensferry Crossing, believes the new bridge will remain in place for at least 120-150 years due to its structural stability and the ease of replacing individual cables of the cable-stay bridge.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"? ?  Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although   on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the  music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

Review: so overwrought you 'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive? Choose from: [1]. negative [2]. positive The answer is:","output":"[1]. negative This movie review sentence can be considered negative for a few reasons. The reviewer seems to provide a rather unfavorable commentary on the film based on the words and tone used. Let's break down the sentence to analyze its negativity more thoroughly. 1. \\"Overwrought\\" suggests that the movie is excessively dramatic, complicated, or emotional, to the point that it is overwhelming or exhausting. This term typically has a negative connotation, implying that the movie might not be enjoyable for viewers due to its intensity or unnecessary complexity. 2. \\"You'd swear\\" implies that the viewer would be convinced of a certain aspect of the film, which, in this case, is its exaggerated nature. This phrase suggests that the reviewer believes the film's overwrought characteristics are quite apparent, reinforcing the negative opinion expressed in the review. 3. \\"Just stepped out of a Buñuel retrospective\\" is a reference to the famous Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel, known for his surrealism and avant-garde works. While some cinema enthusiasts admire Buñuel and his unique style, the sentence implies that the specific film being reviewed is overly concerned with imitating Buñuel's approach. Instead of being an original, engaging work, this part of the sentence suggests that the film lacks creativity and authenticity, borrowing heavily from another filmmaker's style. Overall, the movie review sentence has a negative tone and highlights unfavorable aspects of the film, such as its overwrought nature and dependence on the influence of another director's style."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process:  - Ocean waves hit land - Ocean water pulls sand off of beaches - Ocean water breaks rocks off of cliffs - Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean - Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more global warming occurs happens, how will it affect LESS erosion by the ocean.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"In the case of more global warming, it would generally lead to increased erosion by the ocean due to several factors. However, to explore how it might theoretically affect LESS erosion, let's analyze the following possibilities: 1. Sea level rise: Global warming results in melting ice caps and glaciers, causing sea levels to rise. This may lead to a reduction in the energy of waves in some coastal areas due to the greater distance they need to travel to reach land, potentially reducing erosion to a small extent. However, in many cases, higher sea levels would also lead to greater inundation of coastal areas, ultimately increasing erosion. 2. Changes in ocean circulation: Global warming can cause changes in ocean currents and circulation patterns, which could alter the distribution of sand and sediment along coastlines. Depending on specific regional conditions, these changes might result in reduced coastal erosion in some locations by depositing more sand and sediment on the shores, thereby \\"protecting\\" them from erosion. This would be an indirect effect. 3. Reduced storm frequency or intensity: Global warming is generally expected to increase the frequency and intensity of storms, leading to more coastal erosion. However, if global warming resulted in fewer or less intense storms in specific regions, this could result in less erosion in those areas. Overall, global warming is likely to increase ocean erosion in most cases, but there might exist specific circumstances or locations where it could contribute to reduced erosion. The perturbation hypothesis proposed (global warming leading to less erosion) therefore has a limited direct effect on the process, and any reduction in erosion would be primarily attributed to indirect effects."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: The police arrested two homeless people. James was 35 and had been HIV positive for 20 years, and Bill, who was 54 and was not HIV positive. They booked them and let them go.  and a hint : HIV , or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. AIDS stands for \\"acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\\" It is a condition that causes death and does not have a known cure. AIDS usually develops 10 to 15 years after a person is first infected with HIV. The development of AIDS can be delayed with proper medicines. The delay can be well over 20 years with the right medicines. Today, individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age can expect to reach an average human life span.  Please answer this question : Which person had an incurable disease? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, James, the 35-year-old homeless person, has an incurable disease. He has been HIV positive for 20 years, and HIV is the virus that causes AIDS — an acquired immune deficiency syndrome that does not have a known cure. While the development of AIDS can be delayed with proper medicines, and the delay can be well over 20 years with the right medicines, James is still living with an incurable disease. It is important to note that although there is currently no known cure for AIDS, advancements in medical treatment have made it possible for people living with HIV to manage their condition and live relatively healthy lives. The availability and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which is used to treat HIV infections, can help to suppress the viral load in an individual's body, significantly reducing the risk of transmission and delaying the progression to AIDS. Furthermore, today's medical advancements have allowed individuals who acquire HIV after 50 years of age to expect to reach an average human lifespan, which is an optimistic outlook for those who have access to and can afford proper healthcare. In comparison, Bill, the 54-year-old homeless person, is not HIV positive and thus does not have an incurable disease in the context of the information given. However, it is essential to clarify that the absence of an HIV infection does not guarantee a complete absence of any other potential health issues or incurable diseases. Homeless individuals face numerous challenges, including limited access to healthcare resources, exposure to harsh living conditions, and higher vulnerability to various communicable and non-communicable diseases. As such, it remains crucial to ensure that both James and Bill receive appropriate care, treatment, and support to improve their overall health and wellbeing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, start by adding 129 to both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the other side and isolate the term with the variable g. 2*g - 129 + 129 = -135 + 129 This simplifies to: 2*g = -6 Step 2: Solve for the variable g. Now, you need to get g by itself. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 2.

Maybe some visitors would be surprised when they first come to India. When they talk to an Indian, they would find he would often shake his head. The visitors might think that the Indian doesn't like what they say. But in fact, they would be completely wrong. Indians always shake their heads when they talk to others. It doesn't mean \\"No\\".

Born Florence Annie Bridgwood in Hamilton, Ontario, she was youngest of three children of George Bridgwood, an English-born carriage builder and Charlotte \\"Lotta\\" Bridgwood (nee Dunn), a vaudeville actress. Charlotte Bridgwood had emigrated to Canada from Ireland after the Great Famine with her family as a child. She was known professionally as Lotta Lawrence and was the leading lady and director of the Lawrence Dramatic Company. At the age of three, Lawrence made her debut onstage with her mother in a song and dance routine. Finding themselves \\"at liberty,\\" Lawrence and Solter in 1909 were able to join the Independent Moving Pictures Company of America (IMP). The company, founded by Carl Laemmle, the owner of a film exchange (who later absorbed IMP into Universal Pictures, which he also founded and also the president), was looking for experienced filmmakers and actors. Needing a star, he lured Lawrence away from Biograph by promising to give her a marquee. First, Laemmle organized a publicity stunt by starting a rumor that Lawrence had been killed by a street car in New York City. Then, after gaining much media attention, he placed ads in the newspapers that announced, \\"We nail a lie\\", and included a photo of Lawrence. The ad declared she is alive and well and making The Broken Oath, a new movie for his IMP Film Company to be directed by Solter.  Laemmle had Lawrence make a personal appearance in St. Louis, Missouri in March 1910 with her leading man to show her fans that she was very much alive, making her one of the first performers not already famous in another medium to be identified by name by her studio.  Laemmle generated attention by falsely claiming that Lawrence's St. Louis fans were so excited to learn that she had not died that they rushed her in a frenzy and tore her clothes off. Partially due to Laemmle's ingenuity, the \\"star system\\" was born and before long, Florence Lawrence became a household name. However, her fame also proved that the studio executives who had concerns over wage demands soon had their fears proved correct. Laemmle managed to lure William Ranous, one of Vitagraph's best directors, over to IMP. Ranous introduced Laemmle to Lawrence and Solter, and they began to work together. Lawrence and Solter worked for IMP for eleven months, making fifty films. After this, they went on vacation in Europe.  When they returned to the United States, they joined a film company headed by Siegmund Lubin, described as the \\"wisest and most democratic film producer in history\\". She once again teamed with Arthur Johnson, and the pair made 48 films together under Lubin's direction. At the time, the film industry was controlled by the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), a trust formed by the major film companies. IMP was not a member of the MPPC, and hence operated outside its distribution system. Theaters found showing IMP films lost the right to screen MPPC films. IMP, therefore, had powerful enemies in the film industry. It managed to survive largely due to Lawrence's popularity.

Le secteur de la pêche doit avant tout faire face au problème de l'inefficacité de la surveillance et de la répression de la pêche illégale, faute de patrouilles adéquates. Translate to English.","output":"The fishing sector must first and foremost address the problem of the inefficiency of monitoring and cracking down on illegal fishing, due to a lack of adequate patrols. The fishing industry is a vital source of food and economic activity for many countries around the world. However, one of the primary challenges this sector faces is the issue of ineffective monitoring and enforcement against illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. In particular, insufficient patrol efforts have made it difficult for authorities to prevent or combat these unlawful practices. IUU fishing has wide-ranging consequences for the marine environment, as well as the communities that rely on this resource for their livelihoods. Some of the most negative impacts include: 1. Overfishing: When human intervention exceeds the biological capacity of fish populations to reproduce, this can lead to a depletion of stocks, threatening both the species and ecosystem as a whole. This can further result in the loss of food supplies, employment opportunities, and revenue for local communities. 2. Negative effects on marine ecosystems: Illegal fishing can be particularly damaging to marine environments, as it frequently employs methods that are indiscriminate and destructive, such as bottom trawling or the use of illegal fishing gear. These practices can destroy essential fish habitat, and negatively impact other marine species, including endangered ones. 3. Economic losses: IUU fishing can cause significant economic harm, as legitimate fishers face unfair competition from those who do not comply with sustainable practices and regulations. Furthermore, governments may lose out on valuable tax revenue and may be forced to allocate additional resources to combating illegal activities. 4. Undermining regulations and management efforts: IUU fishing represents a direct challenge to the rule of law and can undermine the efforts of national and international authorities to manage fisheries resources in a sustainable manner. To address these far-reaching consequences, several key measures need to be undertaken to improve the surveillance and enforcement of illegal fishing practices: 1. Enhance international cooperation: Collaboration between governments, regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), and other stakeholders is crucial for sharing information and best practices, as well as coordinating enforcement efforts against illegal fishing operators. 2. Increase resources for monitoring and enforcement: Governments should allocate more financial and human resources to the development of patrol and surveillance capacities, including the use of modern technology such as satellite imaging, drones, and data analysis tools. 3. Improve traceability and transparency: Implementing robust, transparent, and traceable systems to track the movement of fish from capture to market can make it more difficult for IUU-caught fish to enter global supply chains, thus reducing the profitability of these illicit activities. 4. Develop stricter sanctions and penalties: Stronger legal frameworks and sufficient penalties should be put in place to deter would-be offenders. Additionally, enforcing sanctions against those who finance or facilitate illegal fishing operations can assist in combating this issue. In conclusion, improving the surveillance and enforcement efforts against illegal fishing practices is not only essential for the long-term sustainability of the fishing industry, but it also has significant benefits for the overall health of marine ecosystems, local communities, and the global economy. By taking a concerted, multi-pronged approach that involves closer cooperation, investment in monitoring infrastructure, and stronger penalties for offenders, it is possible to make significant progress in the battle against IUU fishing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate this to English?","output":"Nonetheless, some farmers in South America take advantage of deforestation and are able to produce in large quantities and offer more competitive prices than European farmers, as a result of less stringent regulations. In this statement, the author is discussing the issue of deforestation in South America and its connection to agricultural practices. The deforestation practices in the region can offer short-term benefits to farmers, as it allows them to clear vast areas of land quickly and cheaply, enabling them to produce large quantities of crops. This increased production leads to more competitive prices in comparison to European farmers, who may be subject to stricter environmental regulations and land management policies. However, while this approach might offer some economic advantages for the South American farmers, it also contributes to environmental issues such as loss of biodiversity, disruption of ecosystems, and increased carbon dioxide emissions due to forest degradation. Moreover, the long-term consequences of deforestation can be detrimental to the sustainability of agriculture in the region, as the removal of forests may result in soil erosion, loss of soil fertility, and a decrease in water quality and availability. European farmers, on the other hand, may face stricter regulations that aim to protect the environment and promote sustainable agricultural practices. These regulations may range from limitations on the use of pesticides and fertilizers, to requirements for maintaining certain levels of biodiversity and habitat conservation, among others. Although these regulations might lead to higher production costs and less competitive prices in comparison to the South American counterparts, they can contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to agriculture. In conclusion, the statement highlights a crucial issue in modern agriculture: the balance between increased production, competitive prices, and the potential environmental impact. It prompts us to reconsider the importance of sustainable practices in agriculture and the long-term implications of deforestation in South America, as well as the role of regulations and guidelines in protecting the environment and promoting responsible farming."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who still appealed in his images and cultural references to an elite humanist and aristocratic audience? ?  Little is known for certain of the life of Hieronymus Bosch or of the commissions or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history. Although Bosch's career flourished during the High Renaissance, he lived in an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been familiar with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.José de Sigüenza is credited with the first extensive critique of The Garden of Earthly Delights, in his 1605 History of the Order of St. Jerome. He argued against dismissing the painting as either heretical or merely absurd, commenting that the panels \\"are a satirical comment on the shame and sinfulness of mankind\\". The art historian Carl Justi observed that the left and center panels are drenched in tropical and oceanic atmosphere, and concluded that Bosch was inspired by \\"the news of recently discovered Atlantis and by drawings of its tropical scenery, just as Columbus himself, when approaching terra firma, thought that the place he had found at the mouth of the Orinoco was the site of the Earthly Paradise\\". The period in which the triptych was created was a time of adventure and discovery, when tales and trophies from the New World sparked the imagination of poets, painters and writers.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Which of the following is a benefit granted by the Orphan Drug Act: patents, fee waivers, or medical research?\\"  Context: \\"There are special rules for certain rare diseases (\\"orphan diseases\\") in several major drug regulatory territories. For example, diseases involving fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, or larger populations in certain circumstances are subject to the Orphan Drug Act.  Because medical research and development of drugs to treat such diseases is financially disadvantageous, companies that do so are rewarded with tax reductions, fee waivers, and market exclusivity on that drug for a limited time (seven years), regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The Orphan Drug Act, enacted in the United States in 1983, serves to provide incentives for pharmaceutical companies to research, develop, and market drugs for rare or \\"orphan\\" diseases. These diseases, as mentioned in the context, typically affect fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States or larger populations under certain circumstances. Given the smaller patient population, it is often financially disadvantageous for pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for these diseases, as the return on investment can be quite limited. To address this issue, the Orphan Drug Act grants a series of benefits to companies that choose to pursue the development of drugs for orphan diseases. Among the options listed - patents, fee waivers, or medical research - the correct answer is fee waivers. This is because one of the key benefits the Orphan Drug Act provides is a reduction in regulatory fees associated with drug development and marketing approvals. In addition to fee waivers, the Orphan Drug Act offers other incentives to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop orphan drugs. These incentives include: 1. Tax reductions: Companies can also benefit from tax credits when developing orphan drugs. These tax credits amount to nearly 50% of the qualified clinical testing expenses incurred during the development process. This financial incentive significantly reduces the overall cost associated with drug development for these rare diseases. 2. Market exclusivity: Another crucial incentive provided by the Orphan Drug Act is granting a period of market exclusivity for the approved orphan drug. This means that once the drug receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the company responsible for its development receives exclusive rights to market and sell the drug for a period of seven years. This exclusivity period applies regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents, ensuring that the pharmaceutical company has a guaranteed revenue stream for the period of exclusivity. 3. Grants for clinical research: The Orphan Drug Act also provides grant funding to support clinical research on orphan diseases. This financial assistance helps to offset the costs of conducting clinical trials and advances the medical understanding of these rare diseases, making it more viable for pharmaceutical companies to invest in drug development. In conclusion, the Orphan Drug Act aims to facilitate the research, development, and marketing of orphan drugs by offering pharmaceutical companies a range of financial incentives that make the process more economically viable. The benefit granted by the Orphan Drug Act mentioned in the given context is fee waivers, which reduce the regulatory fees associated with drug development. Additionally, tax reductions, market exclusivity, and clinical research grants further encourage the pharmaceutical industry to address the needs of patients suffering from rare or orphan diseases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The extent to which their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies between bands. Many bands who perform Christian rock have ties to the contemporary Christian music labels, media outlets, and festivals, while other bands are independent.  - A lead single is usually the first single to be released from a studio album, by a musician or a band, before the album itself is released.  - Top 40 is a music industry shorthand for the currently most-popular songs in a particular genre. When used without qualification it refers to the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. The term is derived from record music charts, a few of which traditionally consist of a total of 40 songs.

There are several subcategories, dominantly focusing on rock, pop, or urban music. Used alone, \\"CHR\\" most often refers to the CHR-pop format. The term \\"contemporary hit radio\\" was coined in the early 1980s by \\"Radio & Records\\" magazine to designate top 40 stations which continued to play hits from all musical genres as pop music splintered into adult contemporary, urban contemporary and other formats.  - The Big Three television networks are the three major traditional commercial broadcast television networks in the United States: ABC, CBS and NBC.

Plot title: The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance Movie plot: Senator Ransom \\"Ranse\\" Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) arrive by train in the frontier town of Shinbone, in an unnamed western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him. When Stoddard, the naive \\"pilgrim\\" (as Doniphon dubs him), opens a law practice in town, Doniphon and many others believe him crazy for inviting retribution from Valance, who cannot abide any challenge to his \\"authority\\". Force, Doniphon explains, is the only thing Valance understands; he advises Stoddard to either flee the territory or buy a gun. Stoddard maintains he will do neither; he is an advocate for justice under the law, not brute force. He earns the town's respect by refusing to knuckle under to Valance, and by founding a school to teach reading and writing to illiterate townspeopleâincluding Hallie. When Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien), publisher of the local newspaper, offers him a revolver, however, he accepts...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The 99ers? Call them the 73ers. Beginning later this year, the maximum number of weeks the jobless can collect unemployment benefits will be reduced to 73 weeks. The legislation, which Congress approved Friday, calls for unemployment insurance to be reduced in two stages. States with lower jobless rates will see federal benefits trimmed starting in June. The full cut will go into effect in September. Lawmakers also revamped parts of the unemployment insurance system, by allowing drug tests of certain recipients and permitting states to use the funds to subsidize employment. The legislation also creates national job-search requirements for everyone collecting either state or federal benefits. The jobless have been able to collect up to 99 weeks of benefits since November 2009, as part of the nation's unprecedented response to the Great Recession. While long-term unemployment remains a problem, a growing chorus of experts and lawmakers have called for the easing of the safety net as the economy slowly recovers and the federal government looks to rein in spending. Republicans, in particular, had looked to reduce the number of weeks the jobless could collect benefits and tighten eligibility requirements. The unemployment section of the legislation, which also extended the payroll tax credit, costs 30 billion. Americans have collected a total of 434 billion in unemployment benefits over the past four years, with the federal government footing 185 billion of the tab. Starting in September, the jobless in states with unemployment rates below 6%, such as North Dakota and Vermont, will get a maximum of 40 weeks of checks. Now they get as much as 60 weeks. Those in the 6% range will get no more than 54 weeks, a reduction of as much as 32 weeks. Unemployed residents of states around the national average, currently 8.3%, will get a maximum of 63 weeks, which equates to a drop of as much as 36 weeks. The jobless living in states with unemployment rates above 9% will top out at 73 weeks, down 26 weeks from the current 99-week maximum. These states currently include Florida, California and Nevada. The change equates to a loss of thousands of dollars for the jobless. In Washington, for instance, where unemployment is just above the national average, a nine-month reduction in checks could total more than 13,650 if the rate is the same in September. The federal-benefits pullback follows the curtailing of some state benefits last year. At least six states reduced the number of weeks the jobless could receive state benefits from the standard 26. \\"The graduated approach will avoid the shocks to the economy and to unemployed workers that there would have been with a sharp cutoff\\" of federal benefits, said George Wentworth, senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project. \\"It keeps the program functioning as the effective lifeline it needs to be.\\" The legislation will also allow states to screen applicants for illegal drugs if they lost their job due to a failed or refused drug test, or if they are applying for a position that requires testing. States will also be able to apply for waivers enabling them to implement reforms, such as using unemployment insurance funds to subsidize employment. Up to 10 states will be allowed to test Georgia Works-type programs, which place the jobless in training positions while they continue to collect weekly checks. The legislation also mandates the creation of national job-search requirements for all recipients, in order to eliminate the state-by-state approach currently in existence. States will also receive 1 billion to assist with skills testing for the long-term unemployed, underemployed and self-employed. The U.S. Department of Labor already provides funding to assess the work-readiness of the unemployed, but the legislation makes it a requirement for those who have been jobless for more than 26 weeks. Republicans trumpeted the fact that these changes made it into the final bill. But President Obama had also called for several of these adjustments in his American Jobs Act proposal last September.

We have 65 candies to share, and every friend gets 13 candies each. So, to find the number of friends (j), we just divide the total candies (-65, since you gave them away) by the candies each friend gets (-13). j = (-65) / (-13).

First identified in California in 1962, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses.      How common is EV-D68 in the United States?      Small numbers of EV-D68 have been reported regularly to CDC since 1987. However, during 2014 the number of people reported with confirmed EV-D68 infection was much greater than that reported in previous years. We can’t predict whether EV-D68 will be a common type of enterovirus detected this year or in future seasons. That’s because a mix of enteroviruses circulates every year, and different types of enteroviruses can be common in different years.      What time of the year are people most likely to get infected?      In the United States, you are more likely to get infected with enteroviruses in the summer and fall. However, you can get infected year round.      What are the symptoms of EV-D68 infection?      EV-D68 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness, or no symptoms at all.      Mild symptoms may include runny nose, sneezing, cough, body aches, and muscle aches.      Severe symptoms may include wheezing and difficulty breathing.      Anyone with respiratory illness should contact their doctor if they are having difficulty breathing or if their symptoms are getting worse.      How does the virus spread?      Since EV-D68 causes respiratory illness, the virus can be found in an infected person’s respiratory secretions, such as saliva, nasal mucus, or sputum (mucus-like secretions from the lungs). EV-D68 likely spreads from person to person when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or touches a surface that is then touched by others.      Who is at risk?      In general, infants, children, and teenagers are most likely to get infected with enteroviruses and become ill. That’s because they do not yet have immunity (protection) from previous exposures to these viruses. We believe this is also true for EV-D68. Adults can get infected with enteroviruses, but they are more likely to have no symptoms or mild symptoms.      Children with asthma may have a higher risk for severe respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 infection.      How is it diagnosed?      Watch CDC medical epidemiologist Brian Rha explain who is at risk for EV-D68 and more in a 2-minute video on WebMDExternal .      EV-D68 can only be diagnosed by doing specific lab tests on specimens from a person’s nose and throat, or blood. Many hospitals and some doctor’s offices can test ill patients to see if they have enterovirus infection. However, most cannot do specific testing to determine the type of enterovirus, like EV-D68. CDC and some state health departments can do this sort of testing using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) lab test, which allows testing and reporting of results within a few days of receiving specimens. Health departments may contact CDC for further enterovirus typing.      CDC recommends that clinicians consider testing for EV-D68 when patients present with severe respiratory illness and the cause is unclear. For more information, see Enterovirus D68 for Health Care Professionals.      Top of Page      What are the treatments?      There is no specific treatment for people with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Talk to a doctor about your symptoms and the best way to control them.      Some people with severe respiratory illness may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy.      There are no antiviral medications currently available for people who become infected with EV-D68.      How can I protect myself?      You can help prevent yourself from getting and spreading EV-D68 by following these steps:      Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. See Handwashing: Clean Hands Save Lives.      Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.      Avoid close contact such as kissing, hugging, and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick, and when you are sick.      Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your upper shirt sleeve, not your hands.      Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as toys and doorknobs, especially if someone is sick.      Stay home when you are sick.      See our infographic that shows these prevention steps.      There are no vaccines for preventing EV-D68 infections.      Top of Page      What should people with asthma and children suffering from reactive airway disease do?      Children with asthma may have a higher risk for severe symptoms from EV-D68 and other respiratory illnesses. They should follow CDC’s guidance to maintain control of their illness during enterovirus season, which occurs each year in the U.S. during summer and fall.      CDC recommends the following:      Discuss and update your asthma action plan with your primary care provider.      Take your prescribed asthma medications as directed, especially long-term control medication(s).      Be sure to keep your reliever medication with you.      Get a flu vaccine when available each year.      If you develop new or worsening asthma symptoms, follow the steps of your asthma action plan. If your symptoms do not go away, call your doctor right away.      Parents should make sure the child’s caregiver and/or teacher is aware of his/her condition, and that they know how to help if the child experiences any symptoms related to asthma.      For additional information, see “What Parents Need to Know about Enterovirus D68” in      A large outbreak of EV-D68 occurred in 2014. How many people got sick?      In summer and fall 2014, the United States experienced a nationwide outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory illness. From mid-August 2014 to January 15, 2015, CDC or state public health laboratories confirmed 1,395 people in 49 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Almost all of the confirmed cases were among children, many whom had asthma or a history of wheezing. Additionally, there were likely many thousands of mild EV-D68 infections for which people did not seek medical treatment and/or get tested. This was the first documented nationwide outbreak of EV-D68. Although illness associated with EV-D68 is not notifiable, circulation of this virus occurs most often in late summer and fall, which is the typical enterovirus season.      CDC received about 2,600 specimens for enterovirus testing during 2014, which was substantially more than usual. About 39% of those tested positive for EV-D68. About 40% tested positive for an enterovirus or rhinovirus other than EV-D68.      Will we see another EV-D68 outbreak this year or in future years?      Enteroviruses are ever-present in the community. We can’t predict whether EV-D68 will be a common type of enterovirus detected this year or in other future seasons. A mix of enteroviruses circulates every year, and different types of enteroviruses can be common in different years. Each year we expect to detect cases, but the number of cases identified in the U.S. varies from year to year. As in previous years, CDC will continue to work with states to test specimens for enteroviruses to determine virus type, support the identification and investigation of outbreaks, and monitor seasonal activity.

The children were hospitalized between August 9 and September 28 with muscle weakness in their limbs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.      Something is affecting the children's motor nerves, causing weakness primarily in their shoulders, triceps, biceps and hips, says Dr. Joyce Oleszek, a pediatric rehabilitation specialist at Children's Hospital Colorado. Doctors are also seeing some weakness in the neck and facial muscles in these patients.      \\"It seems to be attacking the spinal cord and brain stem,\\" Oleszek said at a press conference Monday.      MRI tests spotted abnormalities in the children's spinal gray matter. Most of the children experienced a respiratory illness before being admitted to the hospital, although only two had a history of asthma.      The latest case was a girl who arrived at Children's Hospital Colorado over the weekend. She and three of the other patients are still at the hospital. The rest have been discharged, said Dr. Sam Dominguez, a microbial epidemiologist at the hospital. Doctors do not know if the neurological damage will be permanent.      The CDC is investigating the cause of these symptoms. Health officials do not believe that the cases were caused by polio, as at least eight of the 10 children are up to date on their polio vaccinations.      \\"We don't know, at this point, if there is any association between the enterovirus EV-D68 that's circulating and the paralytic conditions some of the children in Colorado are experiencing,\\" CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said.      Tests of the children's cerebrospinal fluid came back negative for enteroviruses and West Nile virus. But a test of their nasal passages found enterovirus in six out of eight patients who were tested.      Of those six, four tested positive for enterovirus D68, which has been sending children across North America to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. The other two test results are pending.      \\"It could be something else. That doesn't prove cause and effect, but it's circumstantial evidence,\\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The cause \\"still remains a puzzle.\\"      JUST WATCHED Virus sends hundreds to hospital Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Virus sends hundreds to hospital 01:40      A cluster of children with similar paralysis symptoms was identified in California last year. Samples from two of the children tested positive for enterovirus D68.      Enterovirus D68 is part of the Picornaviridae family, which also includes the poliovirus, other enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Enteroviruses are very common, especially in late summer and early fall. The CDC estimates that 10 million to 15 million infections occur in the United States each year.      These viruses usually appear like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But some types of enterovirus are more serious. These can cause hand, foot and mouth disease; viral meningitis; encephalitis (inflammation of the brain); an infection of the heart; and paralysis in some patients.      This year, enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma. The virus has infected at least 277 people in 40 states, according to the CDC. Cases have also been reported in Canada. Children's Hospital Colorado has treated over 4,000 children with severe respiratory illness since August 18, said Dr. Chris Nyquist, medical director for Infection Prevention and Control. About 10% were admitted.      CNN affiliate WCBS reported Friday that a New Jersey toddler died last week from a severe respiratory illness and that the CDC will be testing samples to see whether he had enterovirus D68.      The CDC is asking other hospitals across the country to be on the lookout for similar cases and to send in information on any patients with these symptoms.      \\"Parents shouldn't panic,\\" Nyquist says. \\"This is very, very uncommon. \\"      Common-sense things, like frequent hand-washing and avoiding sick people, can help protect kids from becoming infected, she said. |||||","output":"Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a non-polio virus first identified in California in 1962.

Please briefly summarize this news article: What a school day looks like inside Children’s Hospital The school day lasts only one hour. Machines beep in the room. The teacher comes right to the student’s bed — though she might have to wear gloves and a mask. That’s what “school” can look like for children who are stuck in the hospital for days and weeks on end. Armed with clipboard, iPad, and hospital gown, Elaine Klingensmith led STAT through a typical school day one recent morning at Boston Children’s Hospital, where she works as a full-time tutor for Education Inc. The nonprofit organization aims to streamline what can be a frustrating process for parents: wrangling school officials to send the schoolwork — and money for tutors’ wages — so that sick kids don’t fall behind in school. Klingensmith and two tutors teach one-hour lessons to up to 20 children per day. Some are frequent visitors with chronic illnesses, while others are newcomers in the hospital for a surgery or transplant. Klingensmith started her morning on the ninth floor of Children’s Hospital. Caleb Hassan, a playful 8-year-old who suffers from cystic fibrosis, sat in a hospital bed in tiger-themed pajamas. Wearing a hospital gown and latex gloves to protect Caleb from infections, Klingensmith read a book with him and helped him calculate the perimeter of an 8-by-4 rectangle. Caleb yawned. “Can we do something different?” he asked. His reward for finishing was to watch a BrainPOP video about healthy eating. The animated series, with quizzes at the end, is among the tools Klingensmith keeps on hand in case she needs to supplement students’ schoolwork. Massachusetts requires public schools to pay for tutoring if a sick child is confined to home or hospital for at least 14 school days. Other states have different versions of that law. While some schools, like Caleb’s, are good about sending work, others aren’t. Founded at Children’s Hospital in 1995, Education Inc. now employs tutors in 46 health facilities in eight states. Tutors aren’t always certified. Klingensmith, who’s 27, is certified to teach only kindergarten through sixth grade, though she also tutors older students. Keeping kids on pace with their classmates can be tough. If the school doesn’t send work to the hospital, Klingensmith said, she calls the teacher to ask which concepts the class is studying. If she can’t get an answer, she resorts to asking the students what they last remember learning. “Sometimes they have no idea,” Klingensmith said. In that case, she falls back on the Common Core national standards, and a variety of work sheets and online programs. Parents often take on the extra role of ferrying schoolwork to and from the hospital. That’s what Napoleon Silva did when his two daughters, Christiana and Nicolette, who have cystic fibrosis, spent their latest stint at Children’s for antibiotic treatments to clear out their lungs. Klingensmith knocked on the sisters’ hospital room door at 10:30 a.m. “Noooooo!” cried 6-year-old Christiana, who had been watching the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on TV. Despite her initial protest, she quickly immersed herself in a math work sheet. Nicolette, who’s 9, worked alongside her sister in the face of various distractions. As she set to work on geometry, Nicolette’s IV pump started beeping, and a nurse swooped in to fix an occluded line. Christiana kept coloring while a nurse flushed the tube through which she receives antibiotics. Studying in the hospital has other challenges: Nicolette had to skip breakfast to prepare for general anesthesia later that afternoon, which made her more easily frustrated. “I don’t get this,” she protested, staring at a math problem about parallel lines. Nicolette said she enjoys the one-on-one attention from her tutor, but she misses science — a subject that’s often omitted in the hospital — and seeing her friends. Keeping kids connected to the classroom is key to maintaining a sense of normalcy during chronic illness, research has found. Aislynn Burns, who’s 9, has used FaceTime to videochat with her classmates during long stints at Children’s for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, said her mom, Tara Woodbury. But after spending nearly two full school years in the hospital, Aislynn had to change from a private to a public school, because it wasn’t worth continuing to pay tuition. Aislynn has done a ton of schoolwork at Children’s Hospital, including writing a biography of her favorite forefather, Benjamin Franklin. But the tutoring isn’t a replacement for school, Woodbury said: “One hour is great, believe me, but there’s six to eight hours in a school day.” Children who are hospitalized for mental health treatment face extra challenges. Hospitals often block their access to the Internet for fear of threats like cyber-bullying, so they can’t complete online assignments, said Lisa Lambert, executive director of the Parent/Professional Advocacy League, a Massachusetts-based network for families of children with emotional, behavioral, and mental health needs. And parents may not even tell the school their child is in the hospital, for fear the information will leak out, Lambert said. She said adolescents who were hospitalized after cutting themselves, for example, have returned to school to find that “everyone in the entire school knows.” Transitioning back to school after hospitalization “is always tough, not just emotionally but also academically,” she said. While younger students may be able to keep up with their classmates, high school students often can’t. Nicolette, who’s in fourth grade, is determined not to fall behind. She has already lost time: She and her sister were admitted on a Tuesday and didn’t start tutoring until the following Monday. She rattled off a list of work she has to do, including taking two tests and reading a history book. She said it was hard to focus on her lesson because her stomach hurt from skipping breakfast. “I was a little more whiny this morning,” she confessed. “[But] once you get into the work the pain starts to go away.” Summary:","output":"In Boston Children's Hospital, there's a special school for kids who have to stay in the hospital for a long time. A teacher named Elaine helps these kids learn for one hour a day. She uses an iPad, clipboard and sometimes wears gloves and a mask. She teaches kids who have different sicknesses and need to be in the hospital. This helps the kids not to fall behind in school when they can't go to their regular class."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sir Edward Spragge (name also written as Spragg or Sprague) (circa 1620 – 21 August 1673) was an Irish admiral of the Royal Navy. He was a fiery, brilliantly accomplished seaman who fought in many great actions after the restoration of King Charles II in 1660. Can we draw the following conclusion? Edward Spragge was an Irish captain before becoming admiral","output":"Sir Edward Spragge (also spelled as Spragg or Sprague) was indeed an Irish naval officer who served in the Royal Navy, ultimately attaining the rank of admiral. Born around 1620, he came from a prominent Protestant and Anglo-Irish family in County Wicklow, Ireland. Spragge's naval career began in the early 1640s when he entered the navy as a low-ranking officer during the First English Civil War. He sided with the Royalists, supporting the cause of King Charles I against the Parliamentary forces. When the king was executed in 1649, and the Roundheads emerged victorious, Spragge was forced to seek refuge in Holland. Here, he would serve under the Dutch navy, where he continued to hone his maritime and military skills. With the restoration of Charles II to the English throne in 1660, Spragge returned to his homeland and resumed service in the British navy. He rapidly rose through the ranks, earning himself a series of promotions and commands of various ships, reflecting his exceptional skills as a naval officer. As a captain, he proved his prowess in several battles, including the Four Days' Battle (June 1-4, 1666) and the St James’s Day Battle (July 25-26, 1666) during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1672, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Spragge was promoted to the rank of vice-admiral and commanded a division during the Battle of Solebay, further displaying his capabilities as a brilliant tactician. The following year, in 1673, he was promoted to admiral, being assigned command of the Blue Squadron in the Royal Navy. He achieved numerous victories during various engagements against the Dutch, ultimately culminating in his heroic death during the Battle of Texel (August 11, 1673). It is, therefore, reasonable and accurate to say that Edward Spragge was an Irish captain before eventually becoming an admiral in the Royal Navy. Throughout his illustrious career, he demonstrated exceptional maritime and military skills, contributing to many significant battles and victories for the British. Spragge's rise through the ranks, from a humble officer to an esteemed admiral, is a testament to both his prowess as a seaman and the respect he earned from his superiors and peers alike. His service offers valuable insight into the challenges and successes of 17th-century naval warfare, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, bravery, and tactical genius in the tumultuous political and military landscape of the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it is important to keep in mind that this answer is not definitive, as there might be various interpretations of the meaning of life, depending on an individual's personal, cultural, and religious background. Many philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions have developed their own unique viewpoints on this topic. Some approaches focus on individual goals and the pursuit of happiness, while others emphasize the social responsibilities and connections that bind us together as a community. A more comprehensive answer to the question would need to delve deeper into each of these aspects and how they interact with one another. In a philosophical sense, the meaning of life can be explored through the lens of existentialism, a movement that addresses human self-awareness, choice, and personal responsibility in discovering one's own values in an indifferent universe. This stance encourages individuals to create their own purpose and find meaning by engaging with the world and with others in a meaningful way. Looking at the meaning of life through religious and spiritual perspectives, various major religions, such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism, propose differing views on the ultimate purpose or objectives of human life. While some emphasize a connection with God or higher powers, others stress the importance of morality, love, compassion, and the pursuit of enlightenment. These diverse interpretations make it clear that the meaning of life can be highly nuanced and subjective. As for the role of ethics, values, and morality in our lives, these principles guide our actions and inform our choices on how to live in society. The way we treat others, care for the environment, and decide what is good or bad are essential aspects of our human existence and ought to be considered when trying to understand the meaning of life. In short, your proposed answer is a reasonable one, as it encapsulates many significant concepts and viewpoints that contribute to the understanding of life's meaning.

Late Night with Conan O'Brien is an American late-night talk show hosted by Conan O'Brien that aired 2,725 episodes on NBC between 1993 and 2009. The show featured varied comedic material, celebrity interviews, and musical and comedy performances. Late Night aired weeknights at 12:37 am Eastern/11:37 pm Central and 12:37 am Mountain in the United States. The show's house band was The Max Weinberg 7, led by drummer Max Weinberg, who also served as a sounding board for O'Brien on the show (more so after Andy Richter's departure). The other six members were Mark Pender on trumpet, Richie \\"LaBamba\\" Rosenberg on trombone, Mike Merritt on bass, Jerry Vivino on saxophone and brother Jimmy Vivino on guitar, and Scott Healy on keyboards. James Wormworth served as backup drummer when Weinberg went on tour with Bruce Springsteen. With the departure of Andy Richter, Max Weinberg assumed a bigger role as an interlocutor for O'Brien's jokes. One common running gag was Max's awkwardness on camera and his apparent lack of chemistry with Conan. Weinberg was often used in sketches as well, which usually revolved around his purported sexual deviance (mostly a penchant for bedding barely legal groupies), although long-running sketches also spoofed Max's lack of knowledge of current affairs.  \\"LaBamba\\" was also used as the butt of many of Conan's jokes. These humorous sketches usually revolved around LaBamba's sizeable mustache, his poor acting skills, and his alleged inability to read written music. Mark Pender would often sing songs on the topic of a current event which ended with him screeching uncontrollably and climbing the risers into the audience. All members of the 7 had successful side careers as studio musicians.  As is common in the talk show format, the Max Weinberg 7 performed the show's opening and closing themes, played bumpers into and out of commercial breaks (they actually played through the entire break for the studio audience), and a short piece during O'Brien's crossover to his desk after his monologue (except for several months beginning in April 2008, where a commercial break was inserted at that point). The show's opening theme was written by Howard Shore and John Lurie (a finalist for the job as band leader). The show's closing theme was called \\"Cornell Knowledge\\", and was lifted from Jerry and Jimmy Vivino's first album together. However, on Late Night, it was played at a much quicker tempo than the album version.  The band played a wide variety of songs as bumpers--usually popular music from a variety of eras. Weinberg sometimes took extended leaves of absence to tour with Bruce Springsteen as the drummer for his E Street Band. During his absence, temporary replacement drummers were hired (most commonly James Wormworth), and the band was led by Jimmy Vivino (\\"Jimmy Vivino and the Max Weinberg 7\\"). Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What kind of music did they play?","output":"The Max Weinberg 7, the house band for Late Night with Conan O'Brien, played a wide variety of songs as bumpers, usually consisting of popular music from a variety of eras.

Please briefly summarize this news article: California attorney general pursues new pimping charges against Backpage site California attorney general Kamala Harris said on Friday she was pursuing new pimping charges against the operators of Backpage.com – a website which advertises escort services and which she said operated “a hotbed of illicit and exploitative activity”. The new charges came two weeks after a judge threw out an earlier case. Harris, an incoming US senator, said she had charged Backpage executives Carl Ferrer, Michael Lacey and James Larkin with 13 counts of pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping. They also are charged with 26 counts of money laundering. Harris said the new charges were based on new evidence. A Sacramento County judge threw out pimping charges against the men on 9 December, citing federal free-speech laws. In the latest case, filed in Sacramento County superior court, Harris claims Backpage illegally funnelled money through multiple companies and created various websites to get around banks that refused to process transactions. She also alleged that the company used photos of women from Backpage on other sites without their permission in order to increase revenue and knowingly profited from the proceeds of prostitution. “By creating an online brothel – a hotbed of illicit and exploitative activity – Carl Ferrer, Michael Lacey, and James Larkin preyed on vulnerable victims, including children, and profited from their exploitation,” Harris said in a statement. Attorneys for the men did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Judge Michael Bowman sided with lawyers for the trio and the company in his ruling earlier this month, saying the website was engaged in free speech allowed under the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects companies from content posted by third parties. In the earlier case, Ferrer, 55, Backpage’s chief executive, was charged with pimping a minor, pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping. Lacey, 68, and Larkin, 67, both from Arizona, were charged with conspiracy to commit pimping. Lacey and Larkin, the website’s former owners, used to own alternative newspapers around the country, including the Village Voice in New York City. Harris has alleged that more than 90% of Backpage’s revenue – millions of dollars each month – comes from adult escort ads that use coded language and nearly nude photos to offer sex for money. She is doubling down on pimping charges in her final days before resigning to take her seat in the US Senate. The Democrat was among 47 state attorneys general who asked Congress in 2013 to help change a provision of the Communications Decency Act that they acknowledged protected Backpage from prosecution. Summary:","output":"California attorney general Kamala Harris has filed new charges against Backpage.com advertising website, accusing its executives Carl Ferrer, Michael Lacey and James Larkin of 13 counts of pimping, conspiracy to commit pimping and 26 counts of money laundering.

Which country experiences a higher anthropogenic productivity?  Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. Answer:","output":"Nepal experiences a higher anthropogenic productivity as they have adopted a different approach to food production that focuses on nature and biodiversity, resulting in better ecosystem adaptability and overall better soil quality. In contrast, the degradation of land in Tibet has led to significant losses in biodiversity, carbon, nitrogen, and overall reduced soil quality, making it less suitable for supporting life."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Kasseem Dean (born September 13, 1978), better known by his stage name Swizz Beatz, is an American hip hop recording artist and record producer from New York City, New York.

You are given a new situation: John is a nuclear scientist who works at the Fermi lab. Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them.  and a hint : Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass.  Please answer this question : Which smaple would not be fissionable, sample C or sample D? The answer to this question is:","output":"Sample C, which contains U-238, would not be fissionable.

Seven of the nine colonial colleges are part of the Ivy League athletic conference: Harvard, Yale, Penn, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, and Dartmouth. (The eighth member of the Ivy League, Cornell University, was founded in 1865.)  - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada.  - Classics or classical studies is the study of classical antiquity. This covers the ancient Mediterranean world, particularly ancient Greece and Rome. It encompasses the study of ancient languages, literature, philosophy, history, and archaeology. Traditionally in the West, the study of the Greek and Roman classics was considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities and a necessary part of a rounded education. Since the 20th century, however, Classics is no longer a part of a typical elite education.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - The University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Penn or UPenn) is a private, Ivy League university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated as \\"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\\", Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and one of the nine original colonial colleges.  - Ezra Cornell (January 11, 1807  December 9, 1874) was an American businessman, politician, philanthropist and educational administrator. He was the founder of Western Union and a co-founder of Cornell University. He also served as President of the New York Agriculture Society and as a New York state Senator.

What is the answer for the question: What collection did the money Gregory put in a safe deposit box come from? from the following article ?  Paul Gregory, a Canadian confidence trickster operating in London, targets a wealthy Canadian woman in Britain to sell her collection of valuable coins. After meeting her at an ice hockey match, he sets about winning her confidence until she is prepared to give him legal control over the sale. He completes the deal without her knowledge, puts the money from the sale in a safe deposit box, and then deliberately waits to be caught by the police. Gregory plans on getting a five-year sentence, with time off for good behaviour, and then collecting his loot when he is released. However, the judge makes an example of the uncooperative Gregory by handing down a ten-year term. Not wishing to spend so much time in jail, Gregory pays Victor Sloane, one of his associates on the outside, to help him escape. Almost immediately, things begin to go wrong. Fearing arrest, he is unable for the moment to recover the money from the safe. Sloane also now begins to demand more money, threatening him with violence, and Gregory is forced to retaliate. Gregory tries to get help from his fellow criminals, calling upon an established code that exists between them. But when his former associate Sloane is found dead – accidentally having choked to death on the gag Gregory placed in his mouth – they refuse to offer him any assistance, as he is now too \\"hot\\". With the manhunt rapidly closing in, he tries to escape with the help of Bridget Howard, a disillusioned ex-débutante and niece of a Chief Constable. She drives Gregory to a deserted cottage near her family's home in rural Wales. While in hiding, he witnesses the police arrive to question Bridget, assumes the worst, and flees again. Attempting to steal a farmer's bicycle, he is shot in the shoulder. He drives away in a stolen truck but crashes and passes out, where he is found by another farmer. Bridget tells the police nothing.

Write a title for this article: Union-sponsored pension plans face more severe funding shortages than their corporate-sponsored counterparts, yet rather than refrain from the practices that have gotten them into trouble they are spending heavily on political lobbying in the hope of squeezing more from employers to make up the shortfall. At least that's the gist of a report released earlier this week by economists at the Hudson Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank based in Washington, D.C. Moreover, the report skewers union leaders for funding their own pension plans better than those made available to rank-and-file members. Organized labor's reaction to the report? \\"In a word, 'Yawn,'\\" says Stephen Lerner, special assistant to the president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). \\"Because of greedy CEOs on Wall Street and at big banks, our stock market lost half its value, and pension funds--union and corporate--took a hit.\\" The Hudson report's broad comparison of funding status among different types of plans was based on 2006 data--so it's not altogether clear how the recent market turmoil might have affected the disparity between so-called Taft-Hartley (union-negotiated) pension plans and employer-sponsored private sector plans. That aside, the numbers seem to speak for themselves: 35% of non-union plans with 100 or more participants were fully funded, vs. just 17% of collectively bargained plans of the same size. Only 14% of non-union plans were less than 80% funded, vs. 41% of union plans. Just 1% of non-union plans had less than 65% funding, vs. 13% of collectively bargained plans. Heading into the recession, leaders at large unions continued to make grandiose promises to rank-and-file members regarding benefits and then sunk funds into risky investments in a bid to make up the gap between the amounts on-hand and those needed to cover their commitments, according to Hudson Institute study authors Diana Furchtgott-Roth and Andrew Brown. For example, assets at the Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund lagged throughout the mid-2000s as the costs of benefits climbed. By 2007, the plan had 62% of assets in equities. By the end of 2008, that equity portfolio had lost 39% of its value. Now the fund has had to cancel lump-sum payments, deny cost-of-living adjustments to new retirees and reduce early retirement benefits. Meanwhile, unions gave at least 250 million to political candidates over the course of the 2008 federal election cycle. While they can't use compulsory dues for political purposes, that hasn't stopped union leaders from strongly encouraging members to donate certain amounts each month to union campaign contribution chests, the Hudson Institute report claims. Why the current need to get so much money to Capitol Hill? To support a pending bill called the Employee Free Choice Act, Furchtgott-Roth and Brown suggest. Legislators are still hashing out the details, but one union goal in the bill is a provision that would force employers into binding arbitration with unions if a bargaining session doesn't result in a contract agreement within four months, the Hudson economists say. \\"Unions want [binding] arbitration because they believe that the threat of arbitration, followed by the arbitration itself, will force employers to offer better compensation packages in the initial bargaining,\\" the report states. \\"Employers oppose [mandatory] arbitration on the grounds that it could require them to pay excessive compensation to workers and impose upon them onerous union work rules, eventually forcing them out of business.\\" The SEIU's Lerner says his organization supports \\"the Employee Free Choice Act as a much-needed check on unbridled corporate power that continues to hurt workers.\\"","output":"Union Pension Plans Face Funding Shortfalls: Lobbying for Relief Amid Risky Investments and Member Inequality"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Sir George Gilbert Scott (13 July 1811  27 March 1878), styled Sir Gilbert Scott, was a prolific English Gothic revival architect, chiefly associated with the design, building and renovation of churches and cathedrals, although he started his career as a leading designer of workhouses. Over 800 buildings were designed or altered by him.  - The Royal Albert Hall is a concert hall on the northern edge of South Kensington, London, which holds the Proms concerts annually each summer since 1941. It has a capacity of up to 5,272 seats. The Hall is a registered charity held in trust for the nation and receives no public or government funding.  - The Frieze of Parnassus is a large sculpted stone frieze encircling the podium , or base , of the Albert Memorial in London , England . The Albert Memorial was constructed in the 1860s in memory of Prince Albert , the husband of Queen Victoria . The frieze is named after Mount Parnassus , the favorite resting place in Ancient Greek mythology for the muses . It contains 169 life - size full - length sculptures , a mixture of low - relief and high - relief , of individual composers , architects , poets , painters , and sculptors from history . The depictions of earlier figures necessarily , were imaginary , although many of the figures were based on materials contained in a collection of artworks and drawings gathered for the purpose of ensuring authentic depictions , where this was possible . The total length of the frieze is approximately 210 feet . The frieze was intended to be the ' soul ' of the memorial , and the memorial 's designer , George Gilbert Scott , stated that he was inspired by the Hémicycle des Beaux Arts by Hippolyte Delaroche . The memorial was not laid out precisely to directions of the compass , however , closely enough that the sides are referred to by direction . Musicians and poets were placed on the south side , with painters on the east side , sculptors on the west side , and architects on the north side . Henry Hugh Armstead carved the figures on the south and east sides , the painters , musicians , and poets ( 80 in total ) , and grouped them by national schools . John Birnie Philip carved the figures on the west and north sides , the sculptors and architects ( 89 named figures , plus two generic figures ) , and arranged them in chronological order . The carving was executed in situ , and was said by Scott to be \`\` perhaps one of the most laborious works of sculpture ever undertaken '' .

The eventual cost , however , exceeded this by some £ 2,000 and the work...  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was established as a sovereign state on 1 January 1801 by the Acts of Union 1800, which merged the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland. The growing desire for an Irish Republic led to the Irish War of Independence, which resulted in Ireland seceding from the Union and forming the Irish Free State in 1922. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom, and the state was consequently renamed the \\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\\".  - The Albert Memorial is situated in Kensington Gardens, London, directly to the north of the Royal Albert Hall. It was commissioned by Queen Victoria in memory of her beloved husband, Prince Albert who died of typhoid in 1861. The memorial was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the Gothic Revival style. Opened in July 1872 by Queen Victoria, with the statue of Albert ceremonially \\"seated\\" in 1875, the memorial consists of an ornate canopy or pavilion, in the style of a Gothic ciborium over the high altar of a church, containing a statue of the prince facing south. The memorial is tall, took over ten years to complete, and cost £120,000 (the equivalent of about £10,000,000 in 2010). The cost was met by public subscription.  - Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819  22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Part of being in love means being completely open to the other person. If you find yourself seeing a whole different side that the person doesn't show the public, then that may be love. For instance, if your partner is pretty serious or polite in public, but shows a more goofy and silly side when you're alone, then they are really opening up to you and loves you.  If the person shares their deepest emotions with you and is comfortable with it, then that could be love.  If the person is comfortable not looking perfect, tripping, or having food stuck in their teeth around you, that means they are okay if you see every side of them. This should be true even during a bad day. If your loved one has had a very bad day but lights up when they see you, then that's a sign of love. If they are in love with you, then the sight of you or the sound of your voice is guaranteed to make them feel better — if only a little bit. The next time they're grumpy or have a bad day, see how they react in your presence. Though this may be silly, check out your loved one's face the next time you see them. Do they look at you in a goofy, watery, silly and adorable way that can only be described as \\"googly-eyed\\"? You will know it when you see it. You won't get this look all the time — you can spot it in the morning, or randomly across the dinner table. You may also be able to catch the person staring at you with the same expression. Love makes people feel giddy, weightless, and like laughing for no reason at all. If you see the person acting this way in your presence, then this may be love. Does your loved one seem hyper, excited, and on the verge of laughing for almost no reason at all whenever they are around you? If so, then this may be love.  If you've said something barely funny and the person cracks up, then they may be lovesick. If the person shows nervous energy or fidgets around a lot around you, then they may just be excited by your presence. If you are suffering unbelievable emotional pain or are just bummed because you have the flu, then this should rub off on the person who loves you. If they truly love you, then they'll absorb some of your negative emotions and will be very upset because they'll want you to feel better as soon as you can. Though they don't have to be as upset as you are, the person should clearly be affected by your mood because all they want is for you to be happy. Summary:","output":"In conclusion, being in love means being completely open and vulnerable with the other person. Signs of love may include showing a different, more personal side when alone, sharing deep emotions, feeling comfortable in each other's presence regardless of imperfections, and lighting up even during bad days. A person in love may also have a \\"googly-eyed\\" expression, exhibit giddy and excited behavior, and be emotionally affected by their partner's well-being. Overall, love makes people feel connected, supportive, and invested in each other's happiness and emotional state, making it a powerful and unique human experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him. Most definitely the most unforgettable classmate. How long was it to when the student narrator arrived at the boarding school that the bully injured someone?

Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives. In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym. Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out. Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator.

In contrast, the United Kingdom's national minimum wage in 2010 was £5.93 per hour for workers aged 21 and over, £4.92 per hour for workers aged 18 to 20, and £3.64 per hour for workers aged 16 to 17, excluding apprentices.

Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties.

The words \\"Mon Tue Thw\\" are unclear and it is uncertain if they refer to the days of the week or are intended to convey a different meaning. The word \\"evea\\" is likely a misspelling of \\"ever.\\" Therefore, clarity is a 1 out of 5 in this review. 2. Informativeness: This review lacks informativeness. While the reviewer claims it to be the best app ever, they provide no context or reasons to support their opinion. There is no mention of the app's features, benefits, or issues they may have experienced. As a result, the informativeness of this review is also a 1 out of 5. 3. Constructiveness: A constructive review analyzes both the positive and negative aspects of the subject and provides constructive feedback for improvement.

Sox cruise past Chicago CHICAGO --- Elvis didn #39;t leave the building on Friday night, but Manny Ramirez and Orlando Cabrera both did. And Curt Schilling left the Chicago White Sox feeling  quot;all shook up. quot; ... What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a baseball game between the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago White Sox. The game took place on a Friday night. The text highlights the impressive performances of three players from the Boston Red Sox: Manny Ramirez, Orlando Cabrera, and Curt Schilling.  Manny Ramirez and Orlando Cabrera are mentioned as having \\"left the building,\\" which is likely a reference to them hitting home runs, a major offensive highlight in a baseball game. The phrase \\"Elvis didn't leave the building\\" might be alluding to a popular saying \\"Elvis has left the building,\\" which signifies the end of an event or performance. This analogy suggests that the game was filled with excitement, and the spectators were thoroughly entertained. Meanwhile, Curt Schilling is mentioned as having left the Chicago White Sox feeling \\"all shook up.\\" This phrase suggests that Schilling had an outstanding pitching performance that was difficult for the opposing team, the Chicago White Sox, to handle. \\"All shook up\\" is an idiomatic expression that means to be deeply affected or upset. This indicates that Schilling's pitching was a significant contributing factor in the game's outcome, causing discomfort and difficulty for the Chicago team.

Aftershocks rattle Chile after earthquake as death toll rises Chile has been shaken by dozens of aftershocks after a powerful earthquake toppled buildings, killed at least 11 people and forced the evacuation of more than 1 million people. The magnitude 8.3 tremor on Wednesday night lasted for three minutes, and caused a series of tsunami surges – some as high as 4.5 metres (15ft) – which swamped towns along the Chilean coast. Tsunami warnings were triggered in Japan, New Zealand and Russia, as well as the US states of California and Hawaii. After a night in which at least 40 aftershocks hit the region – including one at magnitude 7 and seven at magnitude 6 or above – daylight revealed scenes of wreckage and ruin for hundreds of miles along the Chilean coastline. In the port city of Coquimbo fishing boats were tossed across streets, roads were blocked by rockslides and streets were filled with piles of devastated adobe houses. In Illapel, near the epicentre, residents appeared dazed at daybreak as they wandered the streets, searching for loved ones and awaiting the restoration of electricity and other basic services. Army troops were being rushed to the scene. Many of the townspeople had been forced to sleep on the ground outside their destroyed homes. “I thought it was the end of the world and we were going to die,” Manuel Moya told the Associated Press, as he stood next to the ruins of his home. “Everything is a mess. It was a disaster, a total loss. Bottles and glasses shattered and the pipes in the bathroom and kitchen burst,” restaurant owner Melisa Piñones told Reuters. Tongoy, a fishing village popular with tourists, was also hit hard by the first tsunami waves, which made landfall just 25 minutes after the initial earthquake. Several seaside shops and restaurants were completely destroyed. In the popular tourist town of Concón, dozens of coastal restaurants were flooded and nearby surf schools destroyed by the series of waves that flooded distinct areas of the coast. Makeshift altars and lit candles marked the spots where residents had died. The Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, began a tour of damaged areas in the town of La Serena, near Coquimbo. She had previously cancelled her participation in many of the nation’s independence day celebrations scheduled for Friday. “We’re going to have go on the ground to see what the damages are and see where help is needed,” Bachelet said. The earthquake came at the beginning of a four-day national holiday and hundreds of thousands of Chileans had already travelled to the coast. But mass evacuations were largely orderly, as Chile’s national emergency office has run repeated practice evacuations following the massive 8.8 earthquake in February 2010. That quake and the ensuing tsunami killed more than 500 people, destroyed 220,000 homes and washed away docks, riverfronts and seaside resorts. On Wednesday night, panic erupted in Coquimbo where an estimated 40,000 revelers were gathered to inaugurate the nation’s largest independence day celebration late on Wednesday evening. The quake hit just as mayor Cornelio Andrade was on the podium and set to cut the ribbon. “It felt like the earth was splitting open,” Andrade told reporters. “The women began to scream the names of their children who were playing. It was a stampede, everyone was trying to get out.” Chile’s ministry of the interior and public security said 20 people have been injured, but phone networks remain down in parts of the country so the full extent of damage and injury is not yet known. Schools have been closed in several regions. The interior ministry’s national office of emergency has urged people not to return to their homes until they are told it is safe to do so. The quake also sparked fears tsunamis could surge across the Pacific Ocean, with countries as far away Japan, New Zealand, Russia and the US states of California and Hawaii issuing warnings. A watch was issued for the California coast: “A tsunami capable of producing strong currents or waves dangerous to persons in or very near the water is expected. The first wave may not be the largest.” A tsunami advisory for Hawaii said a “major tsunami” was not expected but it warned of sea-level changes and strong currents. The New Zealand minister for civil defence, Nikki Kaye, urged east coast residents in the path of any potential tsunami to stay out of the the ocean, out of boats and off beaches. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said waves reaching one to three metres above the tide level were possible in French Polynesia, and that waves reaching 0.3 to one metre above tide level were possible for some coasts of New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaii, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Japan, New Caledonia, Samoa, Russia and other Pacific territories. The PTWC later downgraded its warnings for some areas, including Hawaii. “However, sea-level changes and strong currents may occur along all coasts,” it said, warning that larges swells arriving between five minutes and one hour could be ongoing. The power of the initial earthquake was such that it could be felt across swaths of South America. In the Chilean capital, Santiago, more than 230km (140 miles) from the epicentre of the quake, buildings swayed and thousands fled their homes to take refuge in the streets. Car alarms were set off in Buenos Aires – more than 1,100km (680 miles) away on the Atlantic side of the continent. Public buildings, including the campus of the University of Buenos Aires, were evacuated. High-rises in the neighbourhoods of Belgrano and Palermo swayed so much that many ran out into the streets. Other Argentinian cities including Rosario and Mendoza reported mass evacuations. Chile is one of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries. Just off the coast, the Nazca tectonic plate plunges beneath the South American plate, pushing the towering Andes cordillera to ever-higher altitudes.

Given the question: Given the background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  and the situation: Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's  farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops.  Answer the following question: Which farmer didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm? The answer is:","output":"Joe is the farmer who didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm.  Given the background information provided, depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants, such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These groundcover plants help stabilize the soil, increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems, and play a crucial role in preventing erosion. Cleaner water can also be achieved through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff in agroforestry systems. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Nutrient uptake can be higher in agroforestry systems, and nutrient loss into streams can be reduced when compared to row-cropped fields. Considering the situation with the two farmers, Gary and Joe, we can infer that Joe's farm has depleted soil, which suggests he has not implemented an agroforestry system or made use of groundcover plants to protect his soil from erosion. On the other hand, Gary started agroforestry a few years back and grows cover crops, suggesting he has taken measures to stabilize his soil and reduce nutrient runoff. Thus, based on the given information, Joe is the farmer who didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm. This is because he has not implemented agroforestry practices that involve the use of groundcover plants, such as naturally growing grasses, which are known to help in stabilizing the soil, reducing erosion, and preventing nutrient runoff. In contrast, Gary has been proactive in adopting agroforestry systems and growing cover crops, leading to better soil health and reduced nutrient runoff on his farm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The White House has announced sanctions against 38 Russian individuals and companies, saying the United States is standing up to ongoing \\"malign activity\\" by the Russian government against Western democracies and around the world. At Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. still wants to work with Russia.  \\"Again, what we would like to see is the totality of the Russian behavior change. We want to continue having conversations and work forward to building a better relationship,\\" Sanders said. The sanctions will be imposed on seven Russian oligarchs — including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — and 12 companies they own or control. Seventeen senior Russian government officials, as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank, also will be targeted. The group includes key members of Putin's inner circle. Those sanctioned will have their assets blocked in the U.S. and people in the U.S. are barred from doing business with them. Friday, a number of U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts welcomed the measure, saying the sanctions are overdue. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the move is the strongest action taken by the Trump administration to date for Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and \\"its murder of dissidents at home and abroad.\\" \\"The sanctioning of oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska, who is linked to Paul Manafort, Alexander Torshin and Putin's son-in-law, will send a strong message to the Kremlin,\\" Schiff said in a statement.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two twin sisters were taken to the doctor's office by their parents. It turned out that Mary had hemophilia while Ann didn't have any blood disease.  But I can use this background: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.  What is an answer for this question: Which sister had blood that was able to clot? Answer:","output":"Ann is the sister whose blood was able to clot.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. die  B. meat  C. cuddly pet  D. feel hunger  E. learn how to dance A:","output":"A. Die If an animal does not eat, it will ultimately die due to malnutrition and starvation. Let me explain the process and consequences in more detail. When an animal doesn't consume food, its body cannot supply the necessary nutrients, calories, vitamins, and minerals essential for its survival. As a result, the animal initially experiences hunger (option D), and its body will send signals to the brain, indicating that it is lacking the energy required to perform vital functions. In response to the lack of nourishment, the animal's body begins to tap into its energy reserves, breaking down stored fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. This process is an attempt to generate energy, but it is not a sustainable long-term solution. Over time, the energy reserves deplete, and the body starts to break down its tissues and organs to supply the essential nutrients for the brain and other vital organs. Malnutrition and starvation bring about a series of adverse effects on an animal's body: 1. Weakened immune system: A lack of essential nutrients makes the animal more susceptible to infections and diseases, as its immune system cannot fight off pathogens effectively. 2. Muscle atrophy: With the body breaking down its tissues to supply nourishment, muscles lose their strength and size, causing the animal's movements to become slower and weaker. 3. Organ failure: As starvation progresses, essential organs like the liver, kidneys, and heart begin to fail due to limited nutrient supply, eventually leading to multi-organ dysfunction. 4. Decreased cognitive function: The brain requires glucose to function correctly, and without it, the animal can experience disorientation and reduced mental capacity. 5. Electrolyte imbalance: Electrolytes are needed to maintain the balance of fluids in the body, facilitate nerve function, and regulate muscle contractions. Starvation can cause electrolyte imbalances, leading to irregular heart rhythms and other life-threatening complications. In conclusion, the most suitable option for answering the question \\"What will happen to the animal if it doesn't eat?\\" is option A - the animal will die. The lack of food intake results in a series of biological consequences, ultimately leading to organ failure and death due to malnutrition and starvation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Florida Gun Supply website says he is raising legal funds for himself and the store's owner, who in July declared his business a \\"Muslim-free zone\\".      The Confederate battle flag is seen as a symbol of slavery to its critics.      But its supporters today say it is an important part of southern heritage.      Florida Gun Supply owner Andy Hallinan said he teamed up with Mr Zimmerman, who was acquitted in 2013 of killing black teenager Trayvon Martin, to sell copies of his Confederate flag artwork.      Mr Zimmerman later tweeted about his reason for painting the flag.      \\"I painted the confederate flag backed by the American flag because I believe that anything can stand with the American flag behind it.\\"      He added: \\"My confederate flag painting also represents the hypocrisy of political correctness that is plaguing this nation.\\"      'Splitting the proceeds'      A post on the store's website said Mr Zimmerman painted it \\"in honour\\" of Mr Hallinan \\"for being a true patriot and leading the country into a better, safer America\\".      Andy Hallinan courted controversy last month when he announced in a YouTube video that his Florida shooting range was closed to Muslims.      Mr Zimmerman said he decided to paint the flag after hearing that the Council on American-Islamic Relations was taking legal action against Mr Hallinan.      At the time, Mr Hallinan said his decision was inspired by the Chattanooga shooting, which was carried out by a man born in Kuwait who spent several years living in the US.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption George Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in 2013      Copies of the painting are selling for 50 a piece, each signed and numbered by Mr Zimmerman. It is unclear how many copies have so far been sold.      Mr Zimmerman's last painting, which features a blue American flag with the words \\"God, one nation, with liberty and justice for all\\", sold on Ebay for over 100,000.      His acquittal in 2013 stirred fierce debate on racial profiling and self-defence laws in the US.      It also helped spark the #BlackLivesMatter movement and continues to be a rallying cry for civil rights campaigners.      There has also been a backlash over the Confederate flag in recent months, after the man charged with killing nine black people at a church in Charleston in June was pictured holding it. ||||| Buy a Print Today and You're Entered to Win George's Original Confederate Flag Painting (Which could be worth up to 100,000!)

This painting was painted in honor of Andy Hallinan for being a true patriot and leading the country into a better, safer America. Zimmerman's last painting sold on Ebay for over 100,000.      Zimmerman's Confederate Flag FAQs:      All art has a story to tell. What's George's story?      George started painting an American Flag on this canvas, but heard about Andy getting sued by CAIR (the Counsel for American/Islamic Relations) while he was working on the painting. George decided to scrap the original American Flag painting and repaint it with a Confederate (Battle) Flag.      ​George painted the confederate flag backed by the American flag because he believed that anything can stand with the American flag behind it. George's confederate flag painting also represents the hypocrisy of political correctness that is plaguing this nation. Politicians across the nation have demanded it's removal; however, not one leader including, but not limited to Barack Hussein Obama demanded the posters displaying a 10,000 bounty on my head, \\"dead or alive,\\" to be removed.​      What a story!      On the back of the original canvas, you can still see an outline of the American Flag.      Isn't the Confederate Flag racist?      No way!      The Confederate Flag HAS been used by a small amount of people to incite racism, however, it has not become a symbol of racism. You cannot assume everyone who flies a Confederate Flag is racist in the same way that you cannot judge every Muslim to be a terrorist, or every gun owner to be a serial killer.      The media is calling you racist. Why are they calling you racist if you're not?      Watch the entire video above, from start to finish. The media isn't interested in spreading the TRUTH about topics. The REAL reason George and Andy have teamed up to sell the Confederate Flag is much less important to the media than continuing to make a villain out of both George and Andy.      4 days after George was found not guilty of murder, he helped pull a family out of an overturned SUV that was on fire. The media didn't bother to report on that because it wouldn't make him look like the evil man they paint him as.      Andy recently paid for and planned the entire funeral for a family involved in a road rage murder. The media didn't bother to report on that because it doesn't make Andy look like a villain either.      The media will ONLY share the point of view that makes them sell more papers. That's all they're interested in.      How big is the print?      The print is 24\\"x18\\", which is the exact same size as the original.      How long will it take to receive my print?      Please allow between 4-6 weeks to receive your print. Each one is numbered and signed by George Zimmerman - which takes a bit of time.      How will you choose the winner of the original print?      Florida Gun Supply has been giving guns away via giveaways for 4 years. We've gotten pretty great atit. We'll take an export of all the customers who have purchased a print and then generate a nuber from www.random.org. This is a fool proof way to ensure that the winner is chosen fairly.

A percentage of the proceeds will also go directly to a charity of our choosing.

Build a movie plot around this: What subject does Mr. Hand teach? American History","output":"Title: Mr. Hand's History Class Step 1: Introduce main characters and setting Justification: It is crucial to establish the primary characters in the story and provide some context for their background and personalities. The setting must be introduced to create an environment for the story to unfold. Plot Introduction: The story takes place at a small-town high school where Mr. Hand, a passionate American History teacher, struggles to engage his disinterested students. Our protagonist is Lucy, a bright, curious, and ambitious student who feels trapped in her mundane life and looks for a way to escape and make a meaningful impact on the world. Step 2: Develop the inciting incident Justification: An inciting incident is necessary to kick off the story and set the plot in motion. Inciting Incident: One day, Mr. Hand discovers a hidden journal in the school's library, which belonged to the town's founder, Jeremiah Watson, a Revolutionary War hero. The journal contains a code that, once deciphered, could potentially reveal significant untold secrets about American History. Mr. Hand teams up with Lucy, who is eager to unravel the mystery and prove her worth. Step 3: Introduce conflict and obstacles Justification: Conflict and obstacles create tension and keep the audience engaged, making them want to know what happens next. Conflict: As Mr. Hand and Lucy work to decipher the code, they face various challenges, including interference from the school's principal, who is more concerned with maintaining the status quo than uncovering the past. Additionally, they must compete against a greedy local historian, Dr. Vargas, who is after the secret for his personal fame and fortune. Step 4: The climax Justification: The climax is the turning point in the story, where the protagonist faces the primary conflict head-on and experiences a significant change. Climax: Just when Mr. Hand and Lucy are close to uncovering the secret, Dr. Vargas and his henchmen corner them in a hidden chamber beneath the town's historical society building. Despite being outnumbered and outmuscled, the duo cleverly outsmarts Dr. Vargas and reveals the secret: an original draft of the U.S. Constitution with additional amendments written by Jeremiah Watson, which could change the course of American History. Step 5: The resolution Justification: The resolution wraps up the story, shows the consequences of the climax, and provides closure to the main storyline and character arcs. Resolution: Once the secret is revealed, the town and the school gain national attention. The school's principal is fired for his lack of support, and Mr. Hand is promoted to a better position. Lucy's passion, intelligence, and bravery propel her to receive a scholarship for a prestigious university. In the end, Mr. Hand and Lucy's discovery brings them closer together, leaves a lasting impact on the future of their town, and shines a new light on the complexities of American History."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. OPTIONS: (A). more big fish will be born in the sea. (B). fish tend to swim towards the shore. (C). fish tend to move towards the warm areas. (D). fish tend to move towards the colder areas. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Fish species are expected to shrink in size by up to 24% because of global warming, say scientists. The scientists argue that failure to control greenhouse gas emissions will have a greater effect on marine ecosystems than previously thought. Previous research has suggested that changing ocean temperatures would affect both the distribution and the reproductive abilities of many species of fish. This new work suggests that fish size would also be heavily affected. The researchers built a model to see how fish would react to lower levels of oxygen in the water. As ocean temperatures increase, so do the body temperatures of fish. But, according to lead author, Dr William Cheung, from the University of British Columbia, the lower level of oxygen in the water is key. Warmer waters could decrease ocean oxygen levels and greatly reduce fish body weight. On the other hand, rising temperatures directly increase the metabolic rate of the fish's body function. This leads to an increase in oxygen demand for normal body activities. So the fish will run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size. The research team also used its model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters. The group believes that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. \\"So in, say, the North Sea,\\" says Dr Cheung,\\" one would expect to see more smaller-body fish from tropical waters in the future.\\" Taking these factors into consideration, the research team concludes that fish body size will shrink between 14% and 24%, with the largest decreases in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. When compared with actual observations of fish sizes, the model seems to _ what's actually happening in the seas. The researchers looked at two case studies involving North Atlantic cod and haddock. They found that recorded data on these fish showed greater decreases in body size than the models had predicted. Dr Alan Baudron, from the University of Aberdeen, UK, believes smaller-sized fish could seriously... Question: We can infer that as ocean temperatures increase  _  . Answer: Answer:","output":"We can infer that as ocean temperatures increase (C) fish tend to move towards warm areas. The article states that the research team used their model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters, and they believe that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. This suggests that fish tend to move towards warm areas as the ocean temperatures increase. Additionally, the researchers found that fish body sizes will shrink between 14% and 24% due to the impacts of global warming, which include warmer waters decreasing ocean oxygen levels and raising fish metabolic rates, leading to a higher oxygen demand for normal body activities. These factors cause fish to run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The Internet can show you lots of jobs all over the world.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Yes, lost hair can regrow, and the process can vary depending on the cause of hair loss and the individual's overall health. To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step and consider possible solutions. Step 1: Understand the cause of hair loss Hair loss can result from various factors like genetics, hormonal imbalance, nutritional deficiencies, stress, and environmental factors. To promote hair regrowth, it's crucial to address the root cause of hair loss first. Step 2: Opt for a healthy lifestyle Adopting a healthy lifestyle can positively impact hair growth. Eating a well-balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and proteins can provide essential nutrients for hair growth. Regular exercise, stress reduction through meditation and yoga, and quitting smoking can also contribute to hair regrowth. Step 3: Take care of your scalp Keeping your scalp clean and healthy provides a conducive environment for hair regrowth. Regularly shampoo and condition your hair, gently massage your scalp, and avoid applying heat or harsh chemicals. Step 4: Choose appropriate hair growth treatments There are FDA-approved medications such as minoxidil and finasteride that can be used to treat hair loss. They slow down hair loss and promote regrowth. These medications are available over the counter or with a doctor's prescription. Please consult with a healthcare professional before using these medications. Step 5: Consider natural remedies There are natural remedies like applying essential oils (e.g., rosemary, lavender), using aloe vera, and using onion juice that may help in promoting hair regrowth. It is essential to keep in mind that these remedies might not work for everyone and may take longer to show results. Step 6: Consult with a professional If you're experiencing severe hair loss, it's crucial to consult with a dermatologist or trichologist to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific condition. To answer your second question, \\"Can we regrow our lost hair?\\" and \\"Could lost hair regrow? If so, how?\\" can be considered the same in the context of seeking a solution for hair regrowth. However, the first question implies an inquiry into whether it's possible, while the second question directly asks for methods to stimulate hair regrowth.

When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an artesian spring). In the case of upwards flowing water, forces oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles.  The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy.  Rob is competing in a cross country race. After running about a mile he reached a place with two signs, sign A and sign B. Sign A says that it's a quicksand.

As a race, we're focusing much attention on our common specific problems, but only diffusely concentrating together on needed solutions - much less so, on esoteric geometric shapes which could affect the patterns of our thinking. Make this lower case","output":"Perhaps introducing new archetypes could encourage innovative thinking and challenge the conventional symbols of a dominating culture that is rapidly spreading across the globe. As a society, we are heavily focused on identifying and analyzing the specific issues that we face collectively, but our efforts in addressing these problems and the solutions often seem rather diffuse or fragmented. Delving into more esoteric geometric shapes and their potential effects on our thought patterns might provide us with alternative perspectives and aid in problem-solving. In our quest to develop new archetypes, we could explore concepts and ideas that have been long overshadowed by our globalized world. By reintroducing these concepts into our social and cultural fabric, we can encourage a deeper, more inclusive understanding of the diverse narratives and histories that have shaped our world. Some potential archetypal ideas to consider could include: 1. The Spiral: Representing growth, evolution, and transformation, the spiral could serve as a symbol for the ever-changing nature of our reality and the continuous process of self-improvement and collective progress. 2. The Web: As a symbol of interconnectedness and the collective network of our lives and experiences, the web could encourage us to recognize the importance of supporting each other and the value of establishing relationships based on mutual understanding and empathy. 3. The Tree: Representing strength, stability, and regeneration, the tree could reflect our need for strong roots and connection to our environment, reminding us of the importance of caring for our planet and respecting the natural world that sustains us. 4. The Labyrinth: Symbolizing the complexity of life's journey and the multiple paths we must navigate, the labyrinth could inspire introspection and a willingness to confront and learn from our internal and external challenges. 5. The Ouroboros: An ancient symbol of a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, the Ouroboros represents the eternal cycle of renewal, the interdependence of life and death, and the wisdom that can only be gained through self-awareness and reflection. By incorporating such archetypal symbols into our thoughts and conversations, we could foster a more creative and holistic approach to problem-solving. By doing so, we acknowledge the wealth of human wisdom that is found in diverse cultural and historical contexts, enabling us to craft solutions that are more adaptable and nuanced than those derived from a single dominating perspective. In conclusion, it is essential for us to challenge the traditional symbols of a dominating culture and instead explore the vast array of archetypes that exist in our collective human understanding. By embracing the esoteric, we provide alternative viewpoints and valuable insights that could greatly influence our problem-solving abilities and mold the way we approach challenges as a society.

We ordered the shrimp brioche - don't bother. They are drowning in BBQ sauce so everything else is pointless.  You could be eating packing styrofoam.  Atmosphere - the management let children run crazy through the restaurant and when  I asked the waiter, I was told there was nothing they could do for fear of being fired.  So instead, they poison the experience rather than ask the family to exert control over their children.  Appalling.  I ordered the salmon and it was very disappointing.  It was supposed to be cooked in lemon butter and the fish is old. All I tasted was the char on the grill.  My colleague ordered the jerk chicken on sweet potato.  Thankfully he asked for the honey on the side.  The chicken was peppered not jerked and peppered to the point of inedibility.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive.  and a hint : Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.  Please answer this question : Who has less abnormal cells in their body? Answer:","output":"Based on the given situation, Charlotte has less abnormal cells in her body compared to Jason. Here is the justification: 1. Jason has been diagnosed with cancer, which we know is caused by mutations leading to abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably and forming a tumor.

At the turn of the 21st century, a post-punk revival developed in British and American alternative and indie rock, which soon started appearing in other countries, as well. The earliest sign of a revival was the emergence of various underground bands in the mid-'90s. However, the first commercially successful bands – the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, Neils Children and Editors – surfaced in the late 1990s to early 2000s, as did several dance-oriented bands such as the Rapture, Radio 4 and LCD Soundsystem. Additionally, some darker post-punk bands began to appear in the indie music scene in the 2010s, including Cold Cave, She Wants Revenge, Eagulls, the Soft Moon, She Past Away and Light Asylum, who were also affiliated with the darkwave revival, as well as A Place to Bury Strangers, who combined early post-punk and shoegaze. These bands tend to draw a fanbase who are a combination of the indie music subculture, older post-punk fans and the current goth subculture.

Given the two facts above, harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems can come from ? The answer is:","output":"Harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems can come from nitrogen oxides, as these compounds are one of the key contributors to air pollution. In order to fully understand this, it's essential to first examine how nitrogen oxides contribute to air pollution and subsequently, how air pollution impacts the respiratory and circulatory systems. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are a group of highly reactive gases that primarily consist of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO). These gases are formed when nitrogen and oxygen react together under high-temperature conditions, such as during combustion processes in vehicles, industrial facilities, and power plants. In the atmosphere, nitrogen oxides can further react with other pollutants, like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to form ground-level ozone (O3), which is a major component of smog. Air pollution, in general, has been proven to have detrimental effects on human health, particularly on the respiratory and circulatory systems. In regard to the harm caused by nitrogen oxides in particular, the following points can be made: 1. Respiratory system effects: Nitrogen oxides, particularly nitrogen dioxide, can irritate and damage the lining of the respiratory tract, making individuals more susceptible to respiratory infections. Prolonged exposure to high levels of nitrogen oxides may lead to chronic bronchitis and decreased lung function. Furthermore, nitrogen dioxide is a major contributor to the formation of ground-level ozone, which can exacerbate pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In severe cases, exposure to elevated levels of ozone may cause permanent lung damage. 2. Circulatory system effects: Air pollution, including nitrogen oxides, has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks, heart failure, and strokes. These harmful effects on the circulatory system arise due to the oxidative stress and inflammation caused by high levels of pollutants in the human body. Studies have shown that nitrogen dioxide can trigger the constriction of blood vessels, leading to increased blood pressure and reduced blood flow to vital organs. 3. Indirect effects on the respiratory and circulatory systems: Nitrogen oxides not only have direct harmful effects on these systems but also contribute to secondary pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) and ground-level ozone, which further amplify the risks associated with respiratory and circulatory diseases. In summary, harm to the respiratory and circulatory systems can come from nitrogen oxides as they are significant contributors to air pollution. These compounds can cause substantial damage to the lining of the respiratory tract, increase susceptibility to infections, aggravate existing respiratory conditions, and have detrimental effects on the circulatory system, including the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it's crucial to strive for overall air quality improvement and emission reduction measures in order to minimize the harmful health impacts of nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.  Archimedes was a great scientist. He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine.  Whose device would have less distance for applied force, Archimedes or Ptolemy? Answer:","output":"Archimedes. Step 1: Understand the problem The problem states that machines can make work easier by increasing force, distance, or changing the direction of force. Archimedes and Ptolemy were called upon by the king of Sicily to invent machines. Archimedes came up with a great machine, while Ptolemy couldn't create a significant device. Step 2: Analyze the machines Since Archimedes came up with a great machine, it can be assumed that his device made work easier by either increasing the force, increasing the distance, or changing the direction of the force. It can also be inferred that Ptolemy's device, which was not a machine, did not hold these properties. Step 3: Compare the distances for applied force The question asks whose device would have less distance for applied force. Since Archimedes' machine made work easier, it likely increased the force applied, which would subsequently decrease the distance over which the force would need to be applied. Ptolemy's device, being less effective and not a machine, would not exhibit this trade-off between force and distance. Therefore, it can be concluded that Archimedes' device would have less distance for the applied force."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common.  Mark has just graduated high school and is going to visit his grandpa, Tom, over the summer for a couple days. Since Tom is retired, he often has plenty of time to go fishing, and he even has a small cabin by the lake. The two men are planning to spend several days at the cabin cooking, fishing, chopping firewood to make fires and just general outdoor activities.  Is Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin higher or lower than Mark's? A:","output":"Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin is likely higher than Mark's due to several factors related to old age. As people age, their immune system becomes less efficient, which increases the risk of serious illnesses and infections. In your given scenario, Tom is over 65 years old and thus experiences a natural decline in his immune system's performance, while Mark is young and just graduated from high school, implying that his immune system is still robust. There are multiple reasons why older people like Tom are more susceptible to getting sick: 1. Reduced immune response: With age, the immune system becomes less efficient, leading to a slower and less effective response in fighting off infections. This makes it more likely for older individuals to catch common illnesses, such as colds and flu, and can be especially dangerous if the immune system is further weakened by a pre-existing condition. 2. Chronic health conditions: Older people are more likely to have chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or respiratory problems, which can weaken the immune system and make them more susceptible to infections. 3. Decreased physical resilience: As people age, their bodies become less resilient, and their ability to recover from illnesses decreases. This means that older individuals may experience more severe and prolonged symptoms compared to younger individuals when they get sick. 4. Decline in organ function: Aging can cause a decline in the function of various organs, such as the lungs or kidneys, which can affect the body's ability to fight off infections. Despite these factors, engaging in outdoor activities and socializing can provide potential health benefits for Tom. For instance, staying active through fishing and chopping firewood may help maintain his physical strength, while spending time with his grandson could positively influence his cognitive and emotional well-being. However, it is essential for both Tom and Mark to take proper precautions while engaging in outdoor activities, such as maintaining good hygiene, getting appropriate vaccinations, and protecting themselves from environmental hazards. This will help minimize the risk of illness for both individuals. In conclusion, Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin is likely higher than Mark's due to the natural decline in immune system efficiency that occurs with age. However, engaging in outdoor activities with proper precautions can provide health benefits for both individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the difference between a serf and a slave? What is the difference between serfs and slaves? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The terms \\"serf\\" and \\"slave\\" are indeed related in that they both describe a condition of unfreedom and servitude. However, there are significant and notable differences in the social, economic, and legal aspects of each type of servitude. In this detailed answer, we will explore the main differences between a serf and a slave alongside the distinctions between the two questions presented. 1. Historical context: Serfdom and slavery have distinct historical contexts. Serfdom was most prominent in the European Middle Ages, particularly in the feudal systems of Western and Eastern Europe. Slavery, on the other hand, has a more global historical context, as it has been practiced since ancient times in various societies, such as ancient Rome, Greece, Egypt, and the Americas during the colonization and transatlantic slave trade era. 2. Legal and social status: Serfs were legally tied to the land they worked on for a lord or noble. As part of the feudal system, they were considered part of the estate and had limited personal freedom. While they were not considered full property like slaves, they could not leave the land without the lord's permission. They were also subject to certain obligations, such as providing labor, goods, and military service to the lord. However, they were afforded some legal protections and certain rights, such as access to common land resources and the right to marry and raise a family. Slaves, in contrast, were considered legal property and were completely at the mercy of their masters, who could sell, trade, or even kill them without facing any legal repercussions. Slaves did not have any rights or legal protections, and they lacked access to social mobility. 3. Economic implications: Serfs typically had a more secure form of livelihood than slaves. They were allowed to cultivate certain plots of land allotted to them by their lords in return for their labor and obligations. They could produce food for their families and sell the surplus in the market, if there was any, for additional income. However, the lord still held considerable control over their economic lives, as he could raise demands or reduce the serfs' share of production as he saw fit. The serfs' economic status, although modest, was more secure compared to that of slaves. In contrast, slaves were often required to work in hard labor jobs without any compensation or control over their working conditions. They did not have any claim to land or the means to earn an independent livelihood. Moreover, the economic opportunities available to slaves could be limited and highly dependent on the whims of their masters. To address the second part of the question, the two submitted questions are nearly identical in meaning, with just slight variations in the wording. Both questions are focused on identifying the difference between serfs and slaves. While the first question uses \\"a serf and a slave\\" and the second question uses \\"serfs and slaves\\", they essentially convey the same request for information about the distinctions between these two forms of servitude."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"__ has been occupied continuously for 14,000 years.\\"  Context: \\"The Anglo-Saxons formed a new, larger, settlement across the Itchen centred on what is now the St Mary's area of the city. The settlement was known as Hamwic, which evolved into Hamtun and then Hampton. Archaeological excavations of this site have uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artefacts in Europe. It is from this town that the county of Hampshire gets its name.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The city mentioned in the context, which has been occupied continuously for 14,000 years, is Southampton. Located on the southern coast of England, Southampton has a rich history that dates back thousands of years. Its strategic location near the confluence of the River Itchen and River Test, along with its natural harbor, has made it an ideal location for settlements throughout history. This ancient city was initially settled by various tribes and peoples, such as the Celts and the Romans, before becoming the home of the Anglo-Saxons who formed a new, larger settlement centered around what is now the St Mary's area of the city. This settlement was known as Hamwic, which later evolved into Hamtun and then Hampton. Hamwic was a thriving Anglo-Saxon community, and the archaeological excavations of this site have uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artefacts in Europe. This rich history has revealed not only how the early Anglo-Saxon settlements were structured and their way of life but also their trade links with other European countries during that period. The county of Hampshire, in which Southampton is located, gets its name from the settlement of Hampton. The name evolved over time, and the county is now synonymous with a long and storied history that encompasses a wide variety of cultures and historical landmarks, such as the famed Winchester Cathedral, the New Forest, and the historic naval port of Portsmouth. Throughout its history, Southampton has endured numerous changes, such as the Norman Conquest and the Industrial Revolution, which have shaped its development. Its port has played a crucial role in its growth, with Southampton being a key departure point for the famous Mayflower, which carried the Pilgrims to America in 1620. In more recent times, Southampton has continued to be an important city in the United Kingdom, being known for its maritime and cultural heritage as well as being a hub for trade, tourism, and education. The city is steeped in history and is home to museums, galleries, and historic sites that celebrate its rich past and showcase its ongoing development. In conclusion, Southampton is the city that has been occupied continuously for 14,000 years. Its fascinating history and valuable archaeological findings have shed light on the lives and cultures that have shaped this region over millennia, making it an important location for the study of ancient civilizations. The city's historical significance extends beyond its Saxon roots, encompassing many different eras and cultures, which have all contributed to the diverse and thriving city it is today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: this composer was known for ballet symphonic works and american nationalism?","output":"The composer known for his ballet symphonic works and infusing elements of American nationalism in his music was Aaron Copland. Copland was an American composer, conductor, and teacher, born on November 14, 1900, in Brooklyn, New York, United States. Apart from the blend of Americanism in his compositions, Copland is famed for the incorporation of folk and ballet into classical music. He is often referred to as \\"the Dean of American Composers,\\" a title reflecting his significant influence on 20th-century American music.  Some of Copland's most distinguished works are his ballet scores. These include \\"Billy the Kid\\" (1938), \\"Rodeo\\" (1942), and \\"Appalachian Spring\\" (1944), the last of which won him the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1945. These works are recognized for their vividness and visual evocations. Many of Copland's ballet scores have strong American themes and feature elements of folk music, embodying the spirit of American nationalism. \\"Billy the Kid\\" is a ballet composed that embodies the spirit of the wild west, and is punctuated by famous cowboy tunes, which gives it an air of rugged authenticity. \\"Rodeo\\" is another ballet filled with cowboy-like American popular melodies. The most famous section, \\"Hoe-Down,\\" has become synonymous with cowboy culture in the United States. \\"Appalachian Spring,\\" is arguably Copland's most well-known ballet composition. It resonates with the simplicity of rural America by using Shaker melodies, particularly the famous \\"Simple Gifts.\\" The score conjures up images of the pioneer landscape and is seen as quintessentially American. Apart from these ballet scores, Copland’s orchestral works, including \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\" and \\"Lincoln Portrait\\", are also celebrated for their strong nationalist sentiment. He was one of the first composers to attempt to create an identifiable American sound. Copland was not only well-versed in music composition, but he was also deeply involved in teaching and promoting understanding of music. Across his career, he lectured, wrote, and taught extensively, making the understanding of music accessible to a larger audience. In summary, Aaron Copland's innovative blend of popular forms such as folk and ballet, alongside classical techniques and his distinct American touch in symphonic compositions left an indelible mark on 20th-century classical music. His work substantially contributed to shaping American classical music and instilling in it a sense of nationalism."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In our life,we may meet people with different personalities .What is your personality type ?Read about the following and find out!

On the surface Mr. & Mrs. Feinstone seem to have a nice life, a beautiful home in Los Angeles & he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong. Alan discovers that Brooke is having an affair with Matt (Michael Stadvec) the swimming pool cleaner, to add to his humiliation Alan then discovers that Matt is also having sex with Paula Roberts (Lise Simms) one of his next door neighbours & to top it all off he owes the IRS, who are breathing down his neck, a shed load of money. Alan starts to lose his mind, he convinces himself that everything is decayed & rotten, just like his patient's teeth, & it's up to him to fix it. That morning at work he begins to take his frustrations & anger out on his patients, first he injures a young boy named Jody (Brian McLaughlin), he sexual assault's a patient named April Reign (Christa Sauls) after he hallucinates that she is his wife & deliberately performs an unnecessary & painful procedure on another. Alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it & goes homicidal starting with his adulterous wife & pool cleaner... Directed by Brian Yuzna I thought The Dentist was a good film & tried something a bit different. The script by Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon & Charles Finch is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as I was expecting the latter, it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like Friday the 13th (1980) with a high body count & a wise cracking dentist villain but what The Dentist actually turned out to be is very different. The Dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness & it does a fine job although having said that I'm not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions. It moves along at a nice pace, has a nice narrative in which I liked the constant connection Alan makes between the decay he sees in his patients & the decay he sees in the world around him & is an entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes. It goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you'll never go again! I liked the ending too where the tables are turned, I'll say no more... Director Yuzna does his usual fine job here, in fact I don't think I've seen a Yuzna film that I didn't enjoy to some extent, he obviously & predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling people's teeth out, sexually molesting them, performing operations on drugs & torturing people with the dreaded dentist's drill. There are some other gore scenes as well, a dead dog, someone gorily slashed with a knife & cut out tongues. Yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget, he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles & I liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed & huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angle. Technically The Dentist is fine, decent cinematography, music & production values although some of the special make-up effects look a little unconvincing. The acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with Corbin putting in a good crackpot performance. The ever cool & genre favourite Ken Foree turns up as Detective Gibbs one of Los Angeles finest. The Dentist didn't turn out like I had expected & all the better for it, if your a horror fan & perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out. I liked it & think it's definitely worth a watch.

Background: Camille Pissarro (French: [kamij pisaRo]; 10 July 1830 - 13 November 1903) was a Danish-French Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painter born on the island of St Thomas (now in the US Virgin Islands, but then in the Danish West Indies). His importance resides in his contributions to both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. He later studied and worked alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54. Context: Jacob Abraham Camille Pissarro was born on 10 July 1830 on the island of St. Thomas to Frederick and Rachel Manzano de Pissarro. His father was of Portuguese Jewish descent and held French nationality. His mother was from a French-Jewish family from the island of St. Thomas. His father was a merchant who came to the island from France to deal with the hardware store of a deceased uncle and married his widow. The marriage caused a stir within St. Thomas' small Jewish community because she was previously married to Frederick's uncle and according to Jewish law a man is forbidden from marrying his aunt. In subsequent years his four children were forced to attend the all-black primary school. Upon his death, his will specified that his estate be split equally between the synagogue and St. Thomas' Protestant church.  When Camille was twelve his father sent him to boarding school in France. He studied at the Savary Academy in Passy near Paris. While a young student, he developed an early appreciation of the French art masters. Monsieur Savary himself gave him a strong grounding in drawing and painting and suggested he draw from nature when he returned to St. Thomas, which he did when he was seventeen. However, his father preferred he work in his business, giving him a job working as a cargo clerk. He took every opportunity during those next five years at the job to practise drawing during breaks and after work.  When Pissarro turned twenty-one, Danish artist Fritz Melbye, then living on St. Thomas, inspired him to take on painting as a full-time profession, becoming his teacher and friend. Pissarro then chose to leave his family and job and live in Venezuela, where he and Melbye spent the next two years working as artists in Caracas and La Guaira. He drew everything he could, including landscapes, village scenes, and numerous sketches, enough to fill up multiple sketchbooks. In 1855 he moved back to Paris where he began working as assistant to Anton Melbye, Fritz Melbye's brother. Question: Did he do well at the acadamey?. Whats the answer?","output":"Camille Pissarro studied at the Savary Academy in Passy near Paris while he was a young student.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Fears of Renewed Instability as Fed Ends Stimulus Program After a nearly uninterrupted five-year rally in stocks and bonds, some investors seem to be getting nervous. On July 31, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 317 points, wiping out the year’s gains. Last week, junk bond funds experienced record withdrawals and junk bond interest rates spiked. Such gyrations may be healthy, a reminder that there are risks and that markets go down as well as up. But they could also be the harbinger of something more worrisome, which would be renewed financial instability as the Federal Reserve brings to an end its extraordinary easy money policy. The Federal Reserve has said it expects to raise interest rates in 2015 for the first time since the financial crisis. “There’s no real precedent for ending anything of this magnitude,” said Jeremy Stein, who left the Fed’s Board of Governors at the end of May to return to Harvard’s economics department, where I caught up with him last month on the day of the Dow’s big drop. As the Fed feels its way, he said, investors may have to prepare for greater volatility. James B. Stewart of The New York Times discusses market volatility on CNBC. While at the Fed, Mr. Stein was viewed as the chief advocate for financial stability on the seven-member board, where he pondered the possible unintended consequences of the Fed’s stimulus policies. Mr. Stein said his differences with his fellow board members, and especially the chairwoman, Janet Yellen, had been exaggerated and were more a matter of nuance. “I certainly felt we were courting some risks” with the Fed’s last round of quantitative easing, he acknowledged. “But then again, given the level of the unemployment rate at the time, some risk-taking was warranted.” In April, in his last speech as a Fed board member, Mr. Stein warned that monetary policy should be “less aggressive” when credit risk premiums were extremely low, as they were then, and they’ve gotten even lower since. “To be clear, we are not necessarily talking about once-in-a-generation financial crises here, with major financial institutions teetering on the brink of failure,” he said in a speech to the International Monetary Fund. “Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that even more modest capital market disruptions may have consequences that are large enough to warrant consideration when formulating monetary policy.” Mr. Stein’s concerns have been gaining traction. They’re expected to be a major topic at next week’s annual gathering of Fed officials, policy makers and economists at Jackson Hole, Wyo. This week, former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Martin Feldstein, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a Harvard professor, sounded similar themes in an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, warning that the Fed-induced low rates “have led to reaching for yield in many ways and in very large magnitudes.” They added, “The risk of excesses and the consequent instability have increased substantially.” Mr. Stein’s analysis has also influenced Ms. Yellen, although she puts a higher priority than he does on full employment. Ms. Yellen devoted an entire speech to the subject of financial stability last month at the I.M.F., where she said the Fed had devoted “substantially increased resources” to monitoring stability and acknowledged that the Fed’s low-interest rate policy had spurred “households and businesses to take on the risk of potentially productive investments.” But, she went on, “Such risk-taking can go too far, thereby contributing to fragility in the financial system.” She even explored a previously taboo subject, which is whether the Fed contributed to the post-2000 housing bubble by keeping rates too low. While conceding the low rates may have been a factor, she warned that raising rates was “a very blunt tool” that would probably have had worse consequences than rising housing prices. While she said she saw no need now for tighter monetary policy than the Fed had charted, she did identify “pockets” of excess and added, “some investors may underappreciate the potential for losses and volatility going forward.” While some critics took Ms. Yellen to the woodshed for purporting to identify bubbles, comparing her comments to then Fed chairman Alan Greenspan’s ill-timed reference in 1996 to the stock market’s “irrational exuberance,” Mr. Stein called Ms. Yellen’s speech “admirable.” The Fed chairwoman “was being forthright,” he said. “She’s struggling with this issue in an honest way, which is progress. I don’t think anyone has yet figured out the right answer about how to deal with this.” Ms. Yellen is hardly alone in worrying that some asset prices are at unsustainable levels, especially in parts of the bond market. The activist investor Carl Icahn weighed in this week on Tumblr, saying, “Yellen’s comments suggest, and I agree, that we are in an asset bubble.” It’s dubious that Ms. Yellen would go that far, but persistently high prices, especially in the bond market, have puzzled many economists. After a brief spike last year after the Fed announced that it would taper its bond purchases, interest rates have fallen this year — the opposite of what many economists and investors expected. (Bond prices fall as interest rates rise, and vice versa.) “You can only explain about 20 percent of the variability in asset prices based on fundamentals,” Mr. Stein said. “We don’t understand the other 80 percent. All the Fed can hope to do is to be slow and deliberate” and communicate its intentions. The Princeton economist Markus K. Brunnermeier, an expert on asset bubbles and crashes, has identified what he calls “synchronization risk,” a phenomenon in which investors ride a wave of price increases even if they realize the assets are overpriced. “It’s what economists call a lack of common knowledge,” he said. “We may all know an asset price is too high, but we don’t know that others know it, too. Timing is everything. The danger is if you move too early and the market doesn’t follow up. So everyone waits on the sidelines watching and listening,” as long as asset prices keep rising. The danger comes when they all try to get out at the same time. This seems especially true of many fund managers, who don’t want to underperform their rivals and obsessively follow one another’s moves. Professor Brunnermeier attributes the sudden spike in interest rates last year partly to a fund stampede once bond prices showed signs of cracking. “I very much think that stability is a major issue, and the Fed has to take it into account,” Professor Brunnermeier said. “Ideally, you want to see markets correct early rather than late in one big crash.” How to achieve that remains elusive. “Speaking only for myself, you don’t want to raise rates too aggressively now,” Mr. Stein said. “It may be too late for that. Financial markets are fairly fragile.” Current official forecasts are for the federal funds rate to rise to 2.5 percent in 2016 from the current rate of 0.25 percent, and Mr. Stein said he was “comfortable” that a rise of that magnitude made sense if the economy stayed on its current course. Still, he says the Fed should stick to its guns even if markets gyrate. “This is subtle, but I’d try to indicate a little more willingness to stay the course if financial markets fluctuate one way or the other,” he said. “Markets seem to sense an element of a Fed put, and that complacency can be a source of risk in itself, so you have to push back on that a bit.” (A put is an option that protects investors if prices decline.) In other words, investors shouldn’t expect the Fed to come to the rescue just because stock or bond markets falter. No one wants another crash, but a garden-variety correction may be just what’s needed to avoid one in the future.","output":"The article discusses fears of renewed financial instability, as the Federal Reserve brings to an end its easy money policy. After a nearly uninterrupted five-year rally in stocks and bonds, some investors were getting nervous, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 317 points in July 2014, wiping out the year's gains. Junk bond funds experienced record withdrawals and junk bond interest rates spiked during that time. The concerns over economic instability are mainly due to the fact that there is no real precedent for ending a stimulus program of this magnitude. As the Federal Reserve felt its way, investors were encouraged to prepare for greater volatility. The concerns about potential instability were expected to be a major topic at the annual gathering of Fed officials, policy makers, and economists, held in August 2014. The article highlights that while some critics are more concerned with asset prices reaching unsustainable levels, especially in parts of the bond market, others argue that the unpredictable nature of asset prices is largely due to varying fundamentals and that all the Fed can hope for is to be slow and deliberate in its actions, with clear communication of its intentions. Overall, the article emphasizes that the real challenge lies in finding ways to prevent or mitigate the potential risks associated with ending the stimulus program, while maintaining overall economic stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A: This was a result of the migration policies essential to the Soviet Nationalisation Programme aiming to russify Estonia – administrative and military immigration of non-Estonians from the USSR coupled with the deportation of Estonians to the USSR.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"After Estonia regained its independence in 1991 following the collapse of the USSR, various Russian institutions and organizations were either removed, restructured, or had their influence significantly reduced during the following decade (1991-2001). The main reasons for this shift were Estonia's need to assert its distinct cultural and political identity and to break away from Soviet-era policies that had promoted Russification. 1. Military bases and installations: The presence of the Russian military in Estonia was a major concern for the newly independent nation. Between 1991 and 1994, a series of negotiations and agreements took place between Russia and Estonia that resulted in the withdrawal of Russian troops and the closure of military bases and installations in the country. 2. KGB presence: The KGB was the Soviet Union's main security agency, with considerable influence in Estonia during Soviet times. In the years following Estonia's independence, the organization's presence was eliminated, with former KGB operatives and informants being prosecuted or expelled from the country. 3. Political institutions: The Estonian Communist Party (EKP) had significant power under Soviet rule. After Estonia's independence, the EKP was disbanded and its properties and assets nationalized. In addition, the political landscape was reshaped through free and fair elections, which allowed for the formation of new political parties independent of direct Russian influence. 4. Russian-language schools: Under the Soviet Nationalisation Programme, Estonian schools were compelled to teach in Russian, effectively promoting Russification. In the 1990s, Estonia reformed its educational system, gradually reintroducing the Estonian language as the primary medium of instruction and reducing the presence of Russian-specific schools. 5. State administration and bureaucracy: During the Soviet era, positions in the Estonian state administration were frequently staffed by ethnic Russians or native Estonians loyal to the USSR. Following independence, strict citizenship and language requirements were implemented to reduce the influence of people with Soviet-era ties, resulting in a significant decrease in Russian presence within the Estonian bureaucracy. 6. State-owned enterprises: After Estonia's independence, the government began a process of privatization, selling off businesses that were previously owned and managed by the Soviet government. This eliminated Russian control over key sectors of the Estonian economy and encouraged investment from other nations. 7. Cultural institutions: Many cultural institutions heavily influenced by Russian policies and norms were either closed down or restructured after Estonia's independence. The government aimed to promote Estonian culture and history, reversing decades of Soviet-imposed Russification. In summary, the decade following Estonia's reclaim of independence was marked by a concerted effort to reduce or eliminate Russian institutions and influences that had permeated the country during Soviet rule. This included the removal of Russian military presence, the restructuring of political and educational systems, and the promotion of Estonian culture and language at the expense of Russification."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

TABOR requirement asks voters to decide whether the state gets to keep 66.1 million in taxes they already have approved      Colorado voters Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a statewide ballot measure that gives state lawmakers permission, once again, to spend 66.1 million in taxes collected from the sale of recreational marijuana.      The outcome came as no surprise given its bipartisan backing, and election returns as of 9:40 p.m. showed Proposition BB receiving about 69 percent support, well above the majority-vote threshold, according to returns from counties.      The secretary of state website incorrectly reported the first returns — getting the results backward, officials confirmed.      The measure sends the first 40 million to school construction and 12 million designated for youth and substance-abuse programs. The remaining 14.1 million goes to discretionary accounts controlled by lawmakers.      The ballot question was the third time in four years that voters considered how to spend pot taxes, after approving Amendment 64 in 2012 to legalize marijuana and Proposition AA in 2013 to levy sales and excises taxes. In both prior ballot questions, voters sanctioned sending 40 million toward school construction.      \\"These election results shouldn't surprise anyone,\\" said Sen. Pat Steadman, the Denver Democrat who authored the measure. \\"Voters have twice indicated they wanted marijuana to be taxed, and the vote just reaffirms that for a third time.\\"      Tuesday's vote became necessary after fiscal analysts underestimated how much revenue the state would collect without the new tax in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015.      The projection is required in the tax's first year by the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, and the mistake mandated a refund unless lawmakers won voter approval to spend it.      If the measure failed, taxpayers would have received a 25 million rebate — ranging from 6 to 16 per person, depending on income level — and another 41 million would return to marijuana growers and recreational users through tax breaks.      The question generated little attention in the off-year election, reflecting the limited controversy on the measure in the General Assembly earlier this year. Only 23 of 100 lawmakers voted against the bill, all Republicans.      \\"We are just fulfilling the promises that were made when Amendment 64 was passed,\\" said state Rep. Polly Lawrence, R-Douglas County, in a recent interview.      The \\"Vote Yes on Prop BB\\" campaign anticipated raising about 14,000 but didn't spend any money on advertisements or mass mailers.      The \\"No on Prop BB/No on Excess Government\\" committee didn't collect any money.      But critics — including Americans for Tax Reform, a Washington, D.C.-based group — sought to label the question as a \\"tax increase,\\" adding a political tint to the issue.      The Independence Institute, a limited government advocacy organization based in Denver, also raised questions about how the money would be spent, suggesting it could be unsustainable.      \\"The original proponents of Amendment 64 were very clever ... to tie pot taxes to school construction, even though the two have zero to do with each other,\\" said Mike Krause at the Independence Institute. \\"It made it an easy choice for a lot of voters.\\"      However, Krause said the vote \\"shows a degree of inconsistency on how people feel about TABOR, because most TABOR overrides, at least statewide, don't do well.\\"      John Frank: 303-954-2409, jfrank@denverpost.com or @ByJohnFrank ||||| × Marijuana tax to pay for college scholarships      NEW YORK — Starting in 2017, high school graduates in one Colorado county will be able to turn to a college scholarship funded by marijuana tax.      On Tuesday, 60% of voters in Pueblo County approved a measure that will phase in an increase in taxes — 5% by 2020 — on marijuana growers to fund college scholarships and other community projects.      The county is expected to raise 3.5 million with this tax increase, and at least half the revenue will go toward funding scholarships for high school graduates in Pueblo to attend local colleges. Depending on revenue, the program might be expanded in future years.      “The whole point of the scholarship program was to make higher education a reality for families who can’t afford to send their kids to school because of debt,” said Paris Carmichael, a spokesperson for Pueblo County.      According to Carmichael, this type of scholarship, funded by a marijuana tax, appears to be the first of its kind.      The challenge for the county will be “how well Pueblo can manage educating minors in staying away from recreational marijuana and encourage the growth and development of that industry [at the same time],” said Tyler Henson, the president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce.      The money not used by the college scholarship program will be dedicated to a long list of community projects that includes enhancing a playground at an elementary school, funding a study about extending an Amtrak route to the county and replacing golf carts at a local golf course. ||||| DENVERStudents attending college in a southern Colorado county will soon have a chance to tap into the state's lucrative legal marijuana industry after voters approved a tax on local cannabis growing operations to fund scholarships for higher education.      Voters in Pueblo County approved by a 60 percent to 40 percent margin a measure that imposes a 5 percent excise tax on cultivators who supply Colorado's medical and recreational marijuana industries, the county clerk's office said on Wednesday.      Beginning in 2017, any high school graduate in the county will be eligible to apply for the scholarship, the Board of Pueblo County Commissioners said in a statement.      The three-member board referred the measure to voters as a way to provide more opportunities for local students to advance their educations at either Colorado State University-Pueblo or Pueblo Community College.      \\"It's due time that we make college affordable for everyone in our community,\\" Commissioner Sal Pace said.      The money will be available to prospective students in any field of study and county officials believe the program is the first of its kind in the nation.      \\"There are some scholarships that come out of the legal marijuana industry but our preliminary research showed that this is the first to come from tax revenue,\\" said Pueblo County spokeswoman Paris Carmichael.      Colorado is among four states and the District of Columbia where voters have approved recreational cannabis use by adults. About two dozen states allow cannabis use for medical purposes.      Under the plan, each year at least 50 percent of the revenue derived from the pot tax will be set aside in a cash fund for the scholarships.      The tax will be phased in over five years, and the county estimates the fund will reach 5 million when it is fully implemented by 2020, according to the ballot question's language.      The remaining receipts from the tax will go toward medical marijuana research, road and hiking trail upgrades, refurbishing a historic courthouse and other public improvement projects, officials said.      Carmichael could not provide the number of marijuana cultivation sites in the county but she said the majority are outdoor growing operations.      The climate in the area is warmer than other parts of Colorado and the 160,000-resident county has long been known for agriculture. Pueblo is home to the annual Colorado State Fair & Rodeo.      (Reporting by Keith Coffman in Denver, Colorado) ||||| Write a summary.","output":"On Tuesday, Colorado voters approved a statewide ballot measure that gives permission for state lawmakers to spend 66.1 million in taxes collected from the sale of recreational marijuana. The measure will see the first 40 million go to school construction and 12 million designated for youth and substance-abuse programs. The remaining 14.1 million will go to discretionary accounts controlled by lawmakers. Furthermore, in Pueblo County, around 60% of voters approved a measure that will phase in an increase in taxes on marijuana growers to fund college scholarships and other community projects. The county expects to raise 3.5 million with this tax increase; at least half of which will provide scholarships for high school graduates in Pueblo. This will make higher education more affordable for families who cannot afford to send their children to school because of debt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Plot title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the name of the work Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of, was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger? is inside the article: After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process in a dishwasher is to fill the dishwasher with water. This is done by connecting the dishwasher to a water supply source, such as a faucet or a dedicated water connection. When the dishwasher is turned on, water flows into the appliance through its inlet valve, which regulates the amount and pressure of the water coming in. Once the dishwasher is filled with an adequate amount of water, the heating element heats the water to the desired temperature, typically between 130°F to 160°F (54°C to 71°C). The higher temperature helps to effectively remove grease and sanitize the dishes. At the same time, dishwasher detergent is added to the water, either manually or through an automatic dispenser system, to help break down food particles and stains. After the water is heated and detergent is mixed in, the dishwasher's pump forces the water up into the pipes connected to spinning paddles or spray arms located inside the appliance. The pressure from the pump makes the paddles or spray arms spin like a sprinkler, spraying water at high pressure onto the dishes, pots, pans, and flatware loaded in the dishwasher racks. The small holes in the paddles or spray arms allow the water to come out in multiple directions, ensuring that all the dishes are adequately cleaned. Throughout the wash cycle, the dishwasher continuously recirculates the water, filtering out food particles and debris to be sure the dishes are washed effectively. When the wash cycle is complete, the used water is drained from the dishwasher through a filter that captures any remaining food particles to prevent them from entering the plumbing system. The heating element is then activated again to heat the air inside the dishwasher, causing the remaining moisture on the dishes to evaporate and dry them. In summary, the first step of the dishwasher process is filling the appliance with water from a water supply source, setting the stage for the subsequent steps of heating the water, adding detergent, pumping the water through the spinning paddles, and spraying the dishes to clean and sanitize them thoroughly."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When early colonial settlers went to America, they took many forms of dance to _ . Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues   so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade  .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country. Question: Why did the caller call out the steps for the dancers?

The speaker seems to be reassuring someone, possibly themselves, that there is no need to worry as they are in a situation where they are properly chaperoned. By stating \\"If she knows I'm in here,\\" the speaker implies that they are aware of Rosa's potential understanding of their presence in this location. Additionally, the statement \\"she's probably hovering outside the door right now\\" suggests that the speaker expects Rosa to be vigilant in her role as a chaperone. This further implies the importance of the presence of a chaperone in the current situation and reinforces the notion that the speaker is indeed \\"in here\\" at the specified location. Therefore, considering the context provided by the text, it seems accurate to conclude that the sentence \\"he's in here\\" is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Kenya's government has extended by six month the deadline to close the world's largest refugee camp.","output":"Title: Kenya Grants a Six-Month Extension to Closure Deadline of World's Largest Refugee Camp Introduction The Kenyan government has recently announced a six-month extension to the deadline for closing Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp, providing temporary relief to the hundreds of thousands of refugees who call the camp home. The closure of the refugee camp has long been a contentious issue, with a variety of humanitarian, economic, and security challenges associated with it. This extension provides additional time for more comprehensive discussions to take place, with the hope of finding a viable solution for the long-term well-being of refugees residing in the camp. Background on Dadaab Established in 1991 during the Somali Civil War, the Dadaab refugee camp is located in eastern Kenya, near the border of Somalia. Over the years, it has housed well over half a million refugees, primarily those fleeing violence in Somalia, but also individuals seeking refuge from other conflict-ridden countries. As of early 2021, the camp is estimated to be hosting approximately 224,000 refugees. Dadaab was never intended to be a permanent home for refugees; however, ongoing conflicts and unsafe conditions in their native countries have forced the inhabitants to remain there for years – for many, all their lives. The camp is a sprawling makeshift city with its own economy, infrastructure, and social fabric, but living conditions remain dire and informal, lacking basic amenities and resources. Reasons behind the proposed closure of Dadaab The Kenyan government first announced plans to close Dadaab refugee camp in 2016, citing national security concerns in the wake of terror attacks linked to Somali extremist group Al-Shabaab and the need to maintain control over its borders. However, repatriation efforts have been slow, and there are widespread concerns about the human rights implications and the lack of solutions available to displaced individuals attempting to return to Somalia or rebuild their lives in a third country. Challenges associated with the extended deadline The extension to the closure deadline of Dadaab raises a number of challenges to be addressed by the Kenyan government, humanitarian organizations, and the international community. 1. Providing adequate resources: The additional six months will require the allocation of resources to ensure the continued operation of the camp. Food, water, healthcare, education, and security are among the needs that must be met in the sprawling camp. 2. Ensuring security: The ongoing presence of Dadaab poses security challenges for Kenya, as extremist groups such as Al-Shabaab may continue to exploit the precarious situation to recruit new members or carry out attacks in the region. 3. Addressing human rights concerns: Camp inhabitants face a range of human rights issues, particularly as they relate to the potential forced return of refugees to Somalia and the need for durable solutions like resettlement or integration into Kenyan society. 4. Navigating international pressure: The closure of Dadaab is highly politically charged, with various international stakeholders urging the Kenyan government to prioritize the protection of the refugees' rights and seek lasting solutions to the crisis. Conclusion The extended deadline for the closure of Dadaab offers a chance for the Kenyan government, humanitarian groups, and international stakeholders to collaborate on developing comprehensive, sustainable solutions to the plight of the refugees. This includes addressing the root causes of displacement, ensuring refugees have access to basic services, and finding durable solutions such as voluntary repatriation, resettlement, or local integration. The decision to close Dadaab refugee camp, however, remains a dilemma that must be balanced between concerns for national security, human rights, and the need for refugees to find lasting solutions to their displacement. The outcome of the additional six months will be critical in determining if the world's largest refugee camp can indeed be closed responsibly and humanely, allowing those who have endured years of uncertainty and hardship to finally rebuild their lives in safety and dignity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, Matthew has a high paying job that not only provides him with financial stability but also the satisfaction of knowing that his efforts in college were not in vain. He is succeeding in his chosen career field and is continually growing in his profession. On the other hand, Brett, after having spent his college years getting drunk and not taking his studies seriously, struggles to find a stable job. He's unable to secure anything that pays well, and his lack of effort in college has left him in a precarious situation. In conclusion, Matthew's dedication to his studies and commitment to his long-term goals enabled him to secure a high paying job today. Brett, however, who chose to prioritize partying and drinking during college, is now facing the consequences of his decisions as he struggles to find stability in his career. So, while in the short term, Brett seemed to be having more fun, it was Matthew's hard work and persistence that led to long-term success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A sheriff's office in Lousiana is under fire from gay rights advocates for targeting men using an outdated law from the early 1800s. According to a report published Sunday in The Advocate, the East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's office has been conducting sting operations to arrest gay men looking for sex in public parks. Over the past two years the Special Community Anti-Crime Team has arrested at least 12 men under an unenforceable 'crime against nature' law deemed invalid by the U.S. Supreme Court a decade ago. Outdated: A report published in The Advocate Sunday revealed a two-year long series of sting operations in East Baton Rouge that seemed to target homosexuals in the community. Undercover officers would meet men in the park and get them to agree to have sex, and that was enough basis to arrest them under the 'crime against nature' law - R.S. 14:89 - which was put on the records book back in 1805. The statue includes language which bans 'the unnatural canal copulation by a human being with another of the same sex or opposite sex.' The Supreme Court struck down that part in a 2003 ruling with a similar law in Texas. Because of the Supreme Court precedent, the courts would be unable to prosecute anyone charged today with that crime. However, according to sheriff's office spokesman Casey Hicks, since the law is on the books police still have the right to enforce it. She also said the men were not targeted for their sexual orientation, but because the office had been receiving complaints about people using the parks to have public sex. Apologize: Metro councilmen John Delgado called for a public apology from Sheriff Sid Gatreaux. 'The issue here is not the nature of the relationship but the location,' Ms Hicks said. 'These are not bars. These are parks. These are family environments.' However, according to District Attorney Hillar Moore III, since the law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 there would be no way of prosecuting any of the men charged with the crime. 'For the Sheriff's Office to be setting up these kinds of sting operations up is a waste of time because they can't prosecute these things,' said Tommy Damico who is defending one of the men arrested last month under the archaic law. Advocates in the gay rights community expressed their outrage over the series of sting operations. 'It is frustrating that people are using their resources to pursue issues like this and arrest people for attempting to pick someone up and go home with them,' said Bruce Parker of Equality Louisiana. 'It's perfectly legal, and we would have to close down every bar in Baton Rouge if that weren't the case.' Civil rights attorney Andrea Ritchie also found the operation unsettling. 'It's really unfortunate that police are continuing to single out, target, falsely arrest and essentially ruin the lives of gay men in Baton Rouge who are engaged in no illegal conduct,' Ms Ritchie said. Metro Councilman John Delgado called for an apology from Sheriff Sid Gatreaux to the men arrested in the operations and the rest of the parish. The Sheriff's Office seemed to partially apologize for the arrests, issuing a statement to The Advocate Sunday saying they 'should have taken a different approach' when dealing with inappropriate behaviour in the park.

Question: Jeremy has found that his tricycle moves faster on the sidewalk than the grass. This is because the sidewalk has (A) more resistance (B) less resistance A:","output":"Jeremy's tricycle moves faster on the sidewalk than the grass because the sidewalk has B) less resistance. To understand why this is the case, let us explore the factors that contribute to the difference in resistance between these two surfaces. 1. Surface texture: The sidewalk is a smooth, hard surface while grass is a softer, uneven surface. The smoothness of the sidewalk reduces the contact surface area between the tricycle's tires and the ground, resulting in a lower rolling resistance. Rolling resistance is the force that resists the motion of the tricycle when it rolls across a surface. Grass, on the other hand, has an uneven surface with more contact area, leading to an increased rolling resistance that slows down the tricycle.  2. Deformation: When the tricycle moves over the grass, the soft nature of the grass causes it to compress under the tricycle's weight. This compression creates additional resistance as the grass tries to return to its original shape and pushes back against the tricycle's wheels. On the sidewalk, very little deformation occurs due to the rigid nature of the surface, resulting in less resistance against the tricycle’s motion. 3. Friction: The friction between the tricycle's wheels and the surface it's moving on affects the overall resistance experienced by the tricycle. The sidewalk has a lower coefficient of friction compared to grass, meaning the wheels roll more easily with less energy loss due to friction. Grass, being a more irregular and soft surface, has a higher coefficient of friction which increases the energy required to move the tricycle and causes it to move slower. 4. Stability: The grass surface can be unpredictable, with patches of soil, rocks, or uneven terrain hidden beneath the blades of grass. These hidden obstructions can cause the wheels of the tricycle to lose contact with the ground or change the direction of motion suddenly, adding resistance to its movement. The sidewalk's consistent and stable surface minimizes these unexpected changes in direction and allows for more efficient movement. 5. Traction: The tricycle's wheel traction also plays a role in the difference in speed on these two surfaces. On the sidewalk, the wheels maintain good traction due to the smooth, flat surface, resulting in less energy being lost to slippage. Grass has variable traction, as the wheels may slip more on wet grass or loose soil, increasing resistance and slowing down the tricycle. In conclusion, Jeremy's tricycle moves faster on the sidewalk because of the reduced resistance provided by the smoother, harder surface, as opposed to the grass which has a higher rolling resistance, more deformation, increased friction, less stability, and variable traction. All these factors contribute to the sidewalk having less resistance (B), making it easier and faster for the tricycle to travel on it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.  What question would one ask from this paragraph?","output":"A five-year-old might ask: \\"Who was Alexis de Tocqueville and what did he write about?\\" Answer: Alexis de Tocqueville was a man from France who lived a long time ago. He liked to think and write about how people lived and how countries were run. He visited a big place called the United States and wrote a book called Democracy in America, talking about how people lived there. He also wrote another book about an important event in France called the French Revolution. He wanted countries to be run well, with people working together to make decisions, but he was careful about not letting everyone have too much power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" What Nicolette thought about King's welfare?

Please answer the following question: -  Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process is the occurrence of photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of the plant's leaf cells.  Here's a detailed explanation of the whole process: 1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air passes through small pores called stomata present in the leaves. 2. Water (H2O) is absorbed by the roots from the soil and transported through vessels (xylem) in the stem to the leaves. 3. In the leaves, both CO2 and H2O reach mesophyll cells that contain specialized organelles called chloroplasts. 4. Inside the chloroplasts, photosynthesis takes place. This process involves capturing sunlight energy with the help of a green pigment called chlorophyll. 5. The sunlight energy is then used to convert CO2 and H2O into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) through a series of chemical reactions. The glucose is used as an energy source and building material for the plant's growth, while the oxygen produced is released back into the environment through the stomata. In summary, the last step of the process is photosynthesis, where sunlight energy is harnessed to convert CO2 and H2O into glucose and oxygen within the chloroplasts of the leaf cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What type of mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain in Minnesota?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis.  The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills.  In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain.  Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry.  Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling.  To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology.  They invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process.  They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones.  A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch.  These improvements led to the production of \\"patent\\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \\"bakers\\" or \\"clear\\" flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry.  This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region. The answer to this question is:","output":"flour mills.  Based on the provided context, the mills that were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain in Minnesota were flour mills. Initially, the power of Saint Anthony Falls fueled sawmills, but it was later utilized for flour mills.

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Marajó, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.

Data: Allen Forrest, genre, Hip hop music; Allen Forrest, birthPlace, Dothan, Alabama; Allen Forrest, background, \\"solo singer\\" Sentence about the following data:","output":"Allen Forrest, a prominent figure in the world of hip hop music, was actually born in Dothan, Alabama. Even though he is part of a genre that has been largely defined by the urban environments of cities like New York City or Los Angeles, Forrest's roots are from a city known more for its agricultural contributions than its musical ones. However, these origins did not prevent him from becoming a successful solo singer in the hip hop genre, which shows the power music has to transcend geographical boundaries. Forrest grew up with music as a big part of his life. His interest in rhythm, rhymes, and storytelling led him to hip hop, a genre that is known for its powerful lyrics and strong messages. He was immediately captivated by the way that hip hop artists could use their words to paint vivid pictures and express deep emotions. This resonated with him, and he knew that this was the pathway he wanted to pursue. Living in the heart of Dixie might seem at odds with a genre that has heavily grown out of New York's Bronx borough and Los Angeles' Compton neighborhood. However, Forrest was determined to put Alabama on the map in the hip hop world, and he did exactly that. Starting as a solo artist, he quickly made a name for himself, not only in his birth place of Dothan but also across the United States. Forrest's background as a solo singer put him in a unique position within the hip hop genre. Instead of being part of a group or crew, which is often common in hip hop, Forrest struck out on his own. This allowed him more artistic control over his music and lyrics, making sure that every song was a true representation of him, his experiences, and his views.  Furthermore, his unique background provided him a different perspective to many of his peers. Coming from Dothan, Alabama has not only influenced his lyrical content, providing an authentic Southern viewpoint, but it also influenced his instrumentals, with his music often reflecting a certain Southern flair that sets him apart in the hip hop genre. To summarize, Allen Forrest is a solo singer from Dothan, Alabama who has made significant contributions to the hip hop music genre. His unique background and place of origin have shaped his career and the music he creates, truly making him a standout artist in the hip hop music landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

William Swann quit as a member of the Crofting Commission last week. BBC Alba has since learned that he had told crofters he would resign if he felt the commission was not dealing with their case in a fair manner. The commission has been in dispute with the crofters in Mangersta and Upper Coll about how they manage their common grazings committees. The commission dismissed both committees, whose members are crofters, earlier this year and appointed officials to run the grazings, which are shared areas of land for raising livestock. Western Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - and commission chiefs have met to discuss the matter. MSP Rhoda Grant has tabled a question in the Scottish Parliament asking the Scottish government if it would establish an inquiry into the Crofting Commission handling of the situation. Catriona MacLean, of the Crofting Commission, said normally such issues were resolved \\"quietly\\" and not in the public domain. She said the meeting with the comhairle had involved discussion on a \\"range of topics\\" and had allowed the commission to \\"explain a lot of things\\".

Write an article based on this \\"Consider the cooking time. Check the baking tray or sheet. Review your storage methods.\\"","output":"Title: Mastering Cooking Time, Baking Tray Maintenance, and Storage Methods for Perfect Meals Introduction: Cooking a delectable meal is part art and part science. It is a delicate blend of accurately estimated cooking time, well-maintained baking trays, and clever storage methods. Whether you're a seasoned home chef or a culinary newbie, these three crucial factors will go a long way in improving the quality and taste of your kitchen creations. This article will provide an in-depth exploration of these essential aspects of the culinary process. Part 1: Considering the Cooking Time 1.1 Importance of accurate cooking times: Cooking time is critical in determining the outcome of any recipe. Properly cooked food not only tastes better but also retains its nutritional value. Overcooking can result in loss of nutrients, reduced flavors, and unfavorable texture. On the other hand, undercooked food might pose health risks due to the presence of harmful bacteria. 1.2 Factors affecting cooking time: Various factors affect cooking time, including ingredients, cooking method, and kitchen appliances. When recipe developers create a recipe, they take into account the standard size, thickness, and shape of the ingredients. Therefore, you should be mindful of any discrepancies between your ingredients and those mentioned in the recipe, as this might affect the cooking time. 1.3 Adjusting cooking time: To achieve the ideal cooking time for a particular recipe, it's useful to invest in a kitchen timer and monitor the cooking process closely. Adjustments, when necessary, can be essential in producing the desired outcome. When in doubt, utilize internal temperature guidelines for certain types of foods, such as meats, to ensure thorough cooking. Part 2: Checking and Maintaining the Baking Tray or Sheet 2.1 Selection of baking trays: Baking trays and sheets come in various materials, sizes, and shapes, with each type serving specific purposes. Choose heavy-gauge, light-colored aluminum or steel trays to promote even heat distribution and prevent overbrowning. Non-stick surfaces may require less oil, but they may not always produce the desired browning effect. 2.2 Regular inspection: Before and after each use, inspect the baking tray or sheet for signs of wear, warping, or damage. Uneven heat distribution, sticking, and potential chemical reactions due to a damaged tray could ruin your culinary creations. 2.3 Proper maintenance: To prolong the life of your baking trays and sheets, hand-wash them using mild dish soap and a non-abrasive sponge. Avoid scrubbing with steel wool or sharp objects that might scratch the surface. Dry the trays thoroughly to prevent any rust formation. Part 3: Reviewing Storage Methods for Optimal Food Quality 3.1 Correct storage methods: Proper storage methods extend the shelf life of your ingredients and maintain their quality, which in turn enhances the taste and appeal of your cooked dishes. Store perishable items such as meats and dairy products in the refrigerator, while dry ingredients like flour and sugar should be kept in airtight containers in a cool, dark pantry. 3.2 Organization strategies: Organize your pantry and refrigerator shelves to group similar items together, ensuring that the oldest items are used first. This system minimizes food wastage resulting from expired products. 3.3 Storage containers: Choose containers made of glass or BPA-free plastic to reduce the risk of potential chemical leaching. Store cooked meals in separate containers to avoid cross-contamination, and label them with their contents and the date. Conclusion: By understanding the importance of cooking time, checking and maintaining your baking trays, and reviewing food storage methods, you can consistently create mouth-watering dishes that satisfy both your taste buds and your health. Implementing these tips in your culinary routine will propel your skills and elevate your meals to new heights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Duck gets a cushy job at the network, while Hunt is left following war after war, unemployed, in an attempt to get back on top.Years later, Duck returns to Bosnia to shoot a \\"puff piece\\" of the network anchor Franklin Harris (James Brolin) covering a peace treaty, along with fresh young journalist (and son of the network vice-president) Benjamin (Jesse Eisenberg).

The appropriate answer to the question \\"Where do you find jellyfish?\\" is not among the given options. However, if we were to choose the most correct one out of these, the closest answer would be E: pond, although it is not entirely accurate. Jellyfish are aquatic creatures primarily found in the ocean, but they can occasionally be found in brackish water, such as estuaries or coastal ponds where a mix of freshwater and saltwater is present. They have a diverse range of habitats, from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea. Jellyfish belong to the phylum Cnidaria – a group of animals that include corals and sea anemones. There are several types of jellyfish, and their specific habitats can vary. Some prefer warmer waters, while others can thrive in colder climates. Most jellyfish are free-swimming, and some live in symbiotic relationships with other marine organisms. The main habitat for jellyfish is the open ocean, where they can be found in the surface layer called the epipelagic zone. This zone contains sunlight, allowing some jellyfish to benefit from photosynthetic algae, which form a symbiotic relationship by living within their tissues. Down in the mesopelagic zone, which is in the midwater, bioluminescent jellyfish can be found. These creatures create their light through a chemical reaction. While it is not common to find live jellyfish in a store, you can find preserved specimens in certain specialty shops, museums, or scientific institutions. Likewise, jellyfish do not naturally inhabit offices or photographs, as these are man-made environments. Cuba, as a geographic location surrounded by the ocean, may have jellyfish populations in its nearshore waters, but it is not a specific habitat for them. In some ponds, particularly those with an input of saltwater, you might find one of the few species that can tolerate low salinity. The most famous example is the \\"golden jellyfish\\" found in Jellyfish Lake on Eil Malk Island in Palau, a unique marine environment. To summarize, jellyfish are predominantly found in the ocean and have diverse habitats that range from shallow waters to the deep sea. While you might occasionally find them in brackish or coastal ponds, the options you provided don't precisely pinpoint their natural habitat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A pale shadow of a great musical, this movie suffers from the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the point of the musical, needlessly \\"opens\\" it up, and muddies the thrust of the play. The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a B'way musical and examines their drive & desire to work in this demanding and not-always-rewarding line of work. Attenborough gives us a fresh-faced cast of hopefuls, assuming that they are trying to get their \\"big break\\" in show business, rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working \\"gypsies\\" living show to show, along with a couple of newcomers.

Since then, praise and respect have poured over the world like rain. He changed industries, redefined business models, fused  technology and art. People are comparing him to Thomas Edison, Walt Disney and Leonardo da Vinci, and saying it will be a very long time before the world sees the likes of Steve Jobs again. After all, there are other brilliant marketers, designers and business people. Many of them have studied Steve Jobs, tried to absorb his methods and his philosophy. Surely they can recreate some of his success. But nobody ever does, even when they copy his moves down. So how did he become a visionary who changed every business he touched? Actually, he has given us clues all along. The story of Steve Jobs boils down to this: Don't go with the flow. If Mr. Jobs saw something that could be made better, smarter or more beautiful, nothing else mattered. Apple has attained its current astonishing levels of influence and success because it is sensitive. It is incredibly focused. It has had amazingly few failures. And that is because Mr. Jobs didn't buy into focus groups, groupthink or decision by a committee. At its core ,Apple existed to carry out his vision. He focused on every button and every corner .He lost sleep over the cardboard of the packaging and the color1 of the power cord. He wanted to sell a smart phone that had no keyboard, when physical keys were what had made BlackBerry the most popular smart phone at the time. Eventually, of course, most people realized that he was just doing that Steve Jobs thing again: being ahead of his time. Mr. Jobs is gone. Everyone who knew him feels that sorrow. But the ripple of that loss will widen in the days, weeks and years to come: to the people in the industries he changed.

Answer the following question: Modern life is impossible without traveling. The fastest way of traveling is by plane. With a modern airliner , you can travel in one day to places which needed a month or more to get to hundreds of years ago. Traveling by train is slower than by plane, but you can see the places you are traveling through. Modern trains have comfortable seats and dining-cars. _ even make the longest journey enjoyable . Some people prefer to travel by sea. You can visit many other countries or different parts of your country. Ships are not so fast as trains or planes, but traveling by sea is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday. Many people like to travel by car. You can make your own timetable. You can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty or one hundred miles a day, just as you like. You can stop if there is something interesting, for example, at a good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meal, or at a hotel to spend the night. That's why traveling by car is popular for pleasure trips, while people usually take a train or a plane when they travel on business. When people travel on business, they usually take   _  . A) a plane or a car B) a car or a boat C) a boat or a train D) a train or a plane Answer:","output":"D) a train or a plane Modern life is indeed impossible without traveling. As the world becomes more interconnected, it is essential for people to move from one place to another for various reasons such as work, education, or leisure. Different modes of transportation offer distinct advantages, depending on the traveler's needs, time constraints, and preferences. Air travel is widely considered the fastest mode of transportation. Modern airplanes are not only efficient but also widely available, making them a popular choice for those who need to cover long distances in a short amount of time. This ability to traverse vast distances within a single day allows for greater opportunities for intercultural exchange, business dealings, and global collaboration. Trains, though slower than planes, offer a unique perspective on the landscape. Passengers can witness the changing scenery as they move from one destination to another, taking in the beauty of the environment and the culture of the locations they pass through. Moreover, many modern trains are equipped with comfortable seating, dining-cars, and entertainment options that can make a long journey highly enjoyable. Sea travel, while not as rapid as planes or trains, can provide an incredibly scenic and relaxing experience. Ships enable passengers to visit multiple destinations, both within one's country and abroad, and often house various amenities that encourage rest and recreation during the journey. However, due to the slower speeds of ships, this mode of transportation may not be ideal for time-sensitive or urgent travel. Car travel affords a great deal of flexibility and autonomy. Being in control of one's schedule allows for spontaneous stops at appealing locations, including restaurants and hotels, and ensures a personalized travel experience. This freedom makes traveling by car especially popular for pleasure trips and vacations. When it comes to business travel, efficiency and speed are often paramount, as professionals need to attend meetings, conferences, or events in various locations. Due to the fast and reliable transportation provided by both trains and planes, the answer to the question is D) a train or a plane. These modes of transportation enable business travelers to reach their destinations quickly, ensuring that they can meet their professional obligations in a timely manner. While traveling by car or sea might be enjoyable for leisurely pursuits, they are generally less practical for those with pressing work commitments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During his time with the Saints, Barrett spent most of his tenure on the team's practice squad. He was released and re-signed multiple times, primarily serving as a practice player and providing depth at the quarterback position. Barrett was eventually released by the team in August 2019 and has not signed with any other NFL team since then. In February 2020, Barrett briefly joined the Seattle Dragons of the XFL, but the league suspended its operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic after only five weeks of play. The XFL filed for bankruptcy and did not restart in 2021. Barrett did not participate in the truncated 2020 XFL season, and his professional football career remains uncertain.

Simplify the equation: 0 = -212 * o - 12167 - 5330 + 537 First, we need to combine like terms, that is, the constants (-12167, -5330 and 537). -12167 - 5330 + 537 = -12167 - 5330 + 537 = -17497 + 537 = -16960 So now, our equation becomes: 0 = -212 * o - 16960 2. Isolate 'o' term: To solve for 'o', we need to add 16960 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 16960 = -212 * o - 16960 + 16960 16960 = -212 * o 3. Divide by the coefficient of 'o': Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'o', which is -212: 16960 / -212 = (-212 * o) / -212 -80 = o Therefore, the solution for the equation is: o = -80"},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  Paragraph: Two rivers, The Minninnippi and The Cedar, flow into the same ocean. The Minninnippi is surrounded almost entirely by farm lands due its location in a flat area of the country that sees regular rainfall. The majority of these farms will have runoff from their crop soil flow into the river. The Cedar is located mostly inside an unpopulated forest.

The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Mozarts' first London lodgings were above a barber's shop in Cecil Court, near St Martin-in-the-Fields. Letters of introduction from Paris proved effective; on 27 April 1764, four days after their arrival, the children were playing before King George III and his 19-year-old German queen, Charlotte Sophia. A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced \\"the most beautiful melody in such a manner that everyone was astonished\\".Many of the nobility and gentry were leaving town for the summer, but Leopold reckoned that most would return for the king's birthday celebrations on 4 June, and accordingly organised a concert for the 5th. This was deemed a success, and Leopold hastened to arrange for Wolfgang to appear at a benefit concert for a maternity hospital on 29 June, at Ranelagh Pleasure Gardens. Leopold apparently saw this effort to support charitable works as \\"a way to earn the love of this very special nation\\". Wolfgang was advertised as \\"the celebrated and astonishing Master Mozart, a Child of Seven Years of Age...\\" (he was in fact eight), \\"justly esteemed the most extraordinary Prodigy, and most amazing Genius, that has appeared in any Age\\". On 8 July there was a private performance at the Grosvenor Square home of the Earl of Thanet, from which Leopold returned with an inflammation of the throat and other worrying symptoms. \\"Prepare your heart to hear one of the saddest events\\", he wrote to Hagenauer in anticipation of his own imminent demise.

FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2012 file photo released by Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's Unha-3 rocket lifts off from the Sohae launch pad in Tongchang-ri, North Korea. The Cold War still rages in... (Associated Press)      U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, center, is mobbed by journalists as he attends the opening session of the annual National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Tuesday, March... (Associated Press)      Without elaborating, the Korean People's Army Supreme Command warned of \\"surgical strikes\\" meant to unify the divided Korean Peninsula and of an indigenous, \\"precision nuclear striking tool.\\" The statement came amid reports that Washington and North Korean ally Beijing have approved a draft of a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for sanctions in response to North Korea's Feb. 12 nuclear test. The draft is expected to be circulated at the U.N. this week.      Such heated military rhetoric and threats are common from North Korea as tensions rise on the Korean Peninsula, and Pyongyang's recent nuclear test and rocket launches, and the push for U.N. punishment that have followed, have increased already high animosity between the North and Washington and ally Seoul.      The United States and others worry that North Korea's third nuclear test pushes it a step closer toward its goal of having nuclear-armed missiles that can reach America, and condemn its nuclear and missile efforts as threats to regional security and a drain on the resources that could go to North Korea's largely destitute people.      North Korea says its nuclear program is a response to U.S. hostility that dates back to the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula still technically in a state of war.      North Korea warned it will cancel the armistice agreement on March 11 because of ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills that began March 1 which the statement called a \\"dangerous nuclear war targeted at us.\\"      North Korea said Washington and others are going beyond mere economic sanctions and expanding into blunt aggression and military acts. North Korea also warned that it will block a communications line between it and the United States at the border village separating the two Koreas.      \\"We aim to launch surgical strikes at any time and any target without being bounded by the armistice accord and advance our long-cherished wish for national unification,\\" the statement said.      North Korea lays the blame for its much-condemned nuclear weapons programs on the United States.      A rich vein of North Korean propaganda fueled by decades-old American threats holds that the North remains at risk of an unprovoked nuclear attack. Washington and others say brinksmanship is the North's true motive for the nuclear push.      ___      Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"North Korea vowed on Tuesday to cancel the 1953 cease-fire that ended the Korean War in response to a U.S.-led push for punishing U.N. sanctions over its recent nuclear test and ongoing U.S.-South Korean joint military drills.

Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum’s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of “green spaces” such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine. In particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation. For Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli’s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance. For Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication. Though floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated—the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented—this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly “scattered” floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, “The tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.” Sacred... Question: Who authored Gardens of the Resaissance?

Let's analyze the passage in detail to understand the reason behind this answer. The passage states the following: \\"I'm doing this over my lunch break\\" and \\"Because I will NEVER BE DONE EVER!\\" These statements imply that there is a heavy workload, which does not allow the person to wait until they are done with work, as they believe that their work is never-ending. This supports option I, meaning that the person has too much work. In addition to the heavy workload, the passage starts with an apology for the potential hurried and incoherent nature of the post, indicating that the person is aware that they need to rush themselves to write the post during their limited time (lunch break). This supports option II, highlighting the need to rush to write the post. Option III, stating the desire to write this before the end of the day, cannot be considered a valid deduction based on the available evidence in the passage. The passage does not mention any deadline or end-of-day constraint explicitly. Since option IV suggests none of the above choices, it would be incorrect, given the evidence supporting options I and II.

Creaming the butter and sugars ensures that air is incorporated into the mixture, giving the cookies a lighter, more delicate texture. 6. Add peanut butter, egg, and vanilla: Add the creamy peanut butter, large egg, and vanilla extract to the creamed butter mixture. Mix until fully combined, ensuring all ingredients are evenly distributed in the dough. 7. Gradually add dry ingredients: Slowly add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies. 8. Stir in rolled oats: Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently stir in the rolled oats, once again being careful not to overmix. 9. Create cookie mounds: Scoop out a heaping tablespoon of cookie dough and, using your hands roll it into a ball. Then, flatten the ball slightly into a thick disc shape. Repeat for the remaining cookie dough, spacing the cookies about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. 10. Create indentations for jelly: Using your thumb or the back of a spoon, gently press down in the center of each cookie to create a small indentation. This is where you'll add the jelly later. 11. Fill indentations with jelly: Using a teaspoon, fill each cookie indentation with your favorite jelly or jam, being careful not to overfill. 12. Bake: Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden. Rotate the baking sheets halfway through to ensure even baking. 13. Cool: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to wire cooling racks to cool completely. Cooling the cookies on the baking sheets helps them to set and maintain their shape. 14. Serve and enjoy: Once completely cooled, enjoy your homemade peanut butter and jelly cookies! Store any leftovers in an airtight container to maintain freshness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a title for this article: At first, I thought it was my imagination. Around the time the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, in September, I noticed that my sad old iPhone 4 was becoming a lot more sluggish. The battery was starting to run down much faster, too. But the same thing seemed to be happening to a lot of people who, like me, swear by their Apple products. When I called tech analysts, they said that the new operating system (iOS 7) being pushed out to existing users was making older models unbearably slow. Apple phone batteries, which have a finite number of charges in them to begin with, were drained by the new software. So I could pay Apple 79 to replace the battery, or perhaps spend 20 bucks more for an iPhone 5C. It seemed like Apple was sending me a not-so-subtle message to upgrade. 1. Apple may be coordinating the obsolescence of its products. 2. Which is annoying for consumers. 3. But possibly worse for the company. Of course, there are more benign explanations. The new software and recent app updates offer fancy new features that existing users want; maybe the battery is sealed with tiny five-point screws for aesthetic considerations. Perhaps, but this isnât the first time that tech analysts and random crazies on the Internet have noted that breakdowns in older Apple products can often coincide with when upgrades come onto the market. Many have taken this as evidence of âplanned obsolescence,â a term that dates to the Great Depression, when a real estate broker suggested that the government should stimulate the economy by placing artificial expiration dates on consumer products so people would buy more. To conspiracy-theory-hungry observers (and some of the rest of us), it might make sense that Apple would employ this business strategy. The tech giant, after all, has reached near-saturation levels in the U.S. smartphone market. If iPhones work forever, people who already own the devicesÂ­ wonât buy new ones. Furthermore, selling products with finite life spans can be good for consumers, depending on their tastes and how informed they are. The fashion industry, whose entire mission is to essentially render products obsolete long before they cease to be functional, does this regularly. I buy clothes from H&M and other low-cost, trend-driven stores knowing full well that the pieces might fall apart after a yearâs worth of washes. And if the clothes wonât be fashionable next year anyway, who cares? Improving the durability â and thereby cost â of the clothes would probably just drive away price-sensitive shoppers like me. Apple has similar considerations. Would the additional longevity of the battery be valuable enough to its core consumers to justify the inevitable higher price? Economists have theories about market conditions that encourage planned obsolescence. A company has strong incentives to degrade product durability when it has a lot of market power and when consumers donât have good substitute products to choose from. (Thatâs what happened with the international light-bulb cartel of the early 20th century, which penalized its members for manufacturing bulbs that lasted more than 1,000 hours.) When Apple started making the iPhone in 2007, its product was so innovative that it could have deliberately degraded durability without fear. But in the last couple years, the company has faced stiffer competition from Samsung and HTC, among others, which should deincentivize planned obsolescence. âBuyers are smart, and if they start figuring out that one of the costs of buying Appleâs products is that theyâre constantly nickel-and-diming you, theyâll switch,â said Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of Chicagoâs Booth School of Business. Well, maybe. A company could still be encouraged to engage in planned obsolescence if consumers perceive large âswitching costsâ associated with going to a new brand. There are plenty of economics textbooks to choose from, for instance, and yet publishers still artificially make their old editions unusable by changing pagination or scrambling homework questions because they know teachers donât want to deal with learning a whole new book. Similarly, iPhone users have probably purchased complementary products, like apps, that wonât transfer to Android phones. They also probably have a network of iPhone-using friends with whom they can chat free using Appleâs Messages app (instead of paying for text messages). These switching costs increase Appleâs incentives to force its existing customers to upgrade by making older models gradually become more dysfunctional. There is, however, a simple way to effectively render an old product obsolete without fleecing your existing customers. Instead of degrading the old model, companies can offer innovations in the new model that make upgrading irresistible. Apple succeeded at doing this for a while, offering new iPhones that included major improvements. In the past, consumers were so excited about the cool new features, like Siri, the voice-activated interface, that they may not have minded (or even noticed) if their old phones started to deteriorate; they planned on upgrading anyway. This time around, thatâs less true. The iPhone 5S and 5C offer fewer quantum improvements. Consumers are more likely to want their old phones to continue working at peak condition in perpetuity, and to feel cheated when they donât. When major innovations remain out of reach, and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers, companies like Apple can still take a cue from the fashion industry. If you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons, you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base. But it seems Apple may have already figured this out too. Just check out the wait times for the iPhone 5S in that shiny new gold color. Catherine Rampell is an economics reporter at The Times.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.

Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist and a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune. Read his column here Ruben Navarrette says Mexico isn't a failed state, but the fate of its drug war is important for US. SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- You may have heard the rumor that, as a result of a bloody drug war that has claimed more than 7,000 lives since January 2007, Mexico is on the verge of being declared a \\"failed state.\\" Drawing a lot of its oxygen from cable demagogues and talk radio, the chatter intensified several weeks ago when the Pentagon issued a report warning that our neighbor -- along with Pakistan, no less -- could face a \\"rapid and sudden\\" collapse because \\"the government, its politicians, police and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels.\\" Frankly, one reason the doomsday talk about Mexico catches on is because it distracts OPTIONS: - CNN from our own problems. - California from our own problems. - Mexico from our own problems. - Navarrette from our own problems. - Pakistan from our own problems. - Pentagon from our own problems. - Ruben Navarrette from our own problems. - Ruben Navarrette Jr. from our own problems. - SAN DIEGO from our own problems. - San Diego Union-Tribune from our own problems. - US from our own problems. - United States from our own problems.","output":"Frankly, one reason the doomsday talk about Mexico catches on is because it distracts the United States from our own problems. The situation in Mexico is undoubtedly concerning, but it is crucial to remember that the United States faces its own set of challenges, such as political division, racial injustice, and a tenuous economy among others. Focusing on the violent drug war in Mexico and labeling the country as a failed state may disseminate a sense of panic and urgency that prevents Americans from addressing critical domestic issues. When attention is shifted to external crises, it becomes easy to forget the need to allocate resources and time to local concerns. Moreover, the debate on whether or not Mexico is a failed state should be framed in the context of bilateral relations between the two countries. Collaborative and cooperative efforts are needed to address the shared issues, such as the drug trade and border security. Instead of giving in to doomsday talk and distancing ourselves from the situation, the United States should take steps to understand the complex social, political, and economic factors driving the violence in Mexico. This way, both nations can work together to develop effective strategies and policies to mitigate the impacts of the drug war and foster stability in the region. By reframing the conversation, policymakers and citizens alike can shift their focus to more productive discussions about the shared challenges faced by both the United States and Mexico. Rather than fanning the flames of sensationalism, we should promote a more compassionate and cooperative approach to the issues at hand. In conclusion, the speculation about Mexico being on the verge of becoming a failed state due to the drug war is not only an inaccurate portrayal of the situation but also a dangerous distraction for the United States. It is essential for both countries to acknowledge and address their respective problems while maintaining open lines of communication in order to promote mutual understanding, collaboration, and long-term stability in the region."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What's the full name of the person posing as a milkman?

At the school my two eldest children go to they have a unique form of parental torture surely invented purely to make my life a misery once a year. ‘Open Homework’: these two words do not belong together do they? Like ‘sugar’ and ‘free’ or ‘drink’ and ‘moderation’ they should never be in the same sentence. So, what, exactly is ‘Open Homework’? Well, it’s just like normal homework — only worse. Lorraine has recently come into contact with 'Open Homework' which has seen her attempt various dubious tasks including knitting in order to encourage her daughter's creative thinking. It’s the kind of homework the tyrannical teacher from Matilda would set; Miss Trunchbull homework. The idea behind Open Homework is to encourage creative free-thinking in a young mind (a dangerous concept to start with for my rebellious pre-teen girls). What happens is a subject is given and you can do whatever you want with it: build a sculpture, write an essay, set it to music, turn it into performance art, make an omelette; anything as long as you can explain the mental acrobatics which helped you come up with your idea in the first place. Lorraine says that working full-time and Open Homework does not mix. Past themes of this annual working-mum-stress-increaser have included ‘flight’ and ‘black and white’. I marvel at some of the pupils’ resulting creations, really I do. Even though parents are forbidden from helping, some of the work is so magnificent it looks like it has been handed in by architect Zaha Hadid or crafted by Professor Brian Cox. Ours, however, tend to end up looking like they’ve been made in the craft room at a lunatic asylum by an inmate with questionable motor skills. This is because I really do try not to help, despite Open Homework sucking up most of my evenings and once waking me up in the middle of the night with a nightmare about the toddler getting hold of the wood glue and sticking a rug to the floor. This project throws me into a week-long Sunday-night-gloom, looming large in the lengthy daily to-do list because my children enthusiastically throw everything they have got at it. When I suggest a little editing of their ideas, some focus perhaps, or possibly a less ambitious ‘build’, as Kevin from Grand Designs would say, I am shushed. I am sent out with a shopping list that once included ‘something that looks like a bug’s eye’. We’ve made board games, built aeroplanes and once Gracie asked me to construct a life-size model of a Friesian cow. Even Blue Peter couldn’t do that, I say, but she replies: ‘Maybe we could knit one and stuff it.’ In a busy household of four children aged three to 12, this kind of project takes over. Bits of the different creations are to be found drying/setting/cooking everywhere. On Sunday I heard Gracie describing Open Homework to her grandma on the phone: ‘It’s this fun thing we do that Mum hates,’ she said. ‘Mum sort of comes up with an idea and then we do it for her.’ I feel the meaning of the mission has been lost. This year we have the number ‘100’ as the theme — no doubt inspired by the centenary of the war. Of course Gracie does not want to do something so obvious as this anniversary. ‘God mum, everyone will do that,’ she says. And so begins the fraught discussion of ideas. She will have ten, develop five into an embryonic project for which all manner of empty jam jars, egg boxes, candles and silver paint will be required. By day three of Open Homework I will feel like lying down in the middle of the road clutching a sign saying ‘do not resuscitate’ as she narrows down her choice to one idea. The girls approach this with far more enthusiasm than any other homework. Perhaps because of my antipathy they love it as much as I fear it. Maybe if I didn’t work I would have more time and enjoy taking part? Maybe not. I find normal homework, especially maths, gruelling but this no-rules homework pains me more. And we never have enough glue. We have now come up with an idea after hours of discussion. Does anyone know where I can get something that looks like a small marsupial?

The siblings were separated during their tumultuous childhood, and now Adrian has returned to town to uncover the mystery surrounding his sister's death and bring justice to Sarah's memory. As Lolita gets closer to the truth about her mother's death and the connection between her father, grandmother, and Adrian's family, the movie reaches a turning point. Clues lead Lolita to ultimately confront Amelia, her grandmother, who is forced to unveil her tragic involvement in Sarah's death, driven by misguided love and a desperate attempt to protect the family. The climax of the movie is emotionally powerful, as Amelia reveals that she was inadvertently responsible for Sarah's murder when she mistook her for an intruder in the midst of a panic-stricken, fateful night. Grief-stricken, Amelia had conspired with Richard to cover up this dark secret and shield Lolita from the devastating truth.

Through forgiveness and acceptance, she works to rebuild the relationship with her father, and she finally begins her journey of understanding and coming to terms with her mother's tragic death. They make peace with Amelia, who finally finds solace in the knowledge that both Adrian and Lolita understand her actions even if they cannot completely forgive her. The three, learning to grieve together, slowly piece their lives back together, walking toward a future with the truth - both devastating and liberating - by their side."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I found the following answer on Google: This really means that you don't have to pay both Sales Tax as well as Use Tax on one transaction. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","output":"No, the provided answer does not accurately explain what use taxes are. Use taxes are a type of tax that applies to tangible personal property, services, or certain products purchased from a seller who does not collect sales tax due to being located out-of-state or country. Essentially, use tax ensures that consumers pay a comparable amount of tax, regardless of whether they purchase items from in-state or out-of-state sellers. It is a complementary tax to sales tax and usually has similar rates. Sales tax, on the other hand, applies to items purchased within the state from businesses that are registered to collect and remit taxes. When you purchase an item from a seller located in your state, they typically collect the applicable sales tax at the point of sale. In summary, sales tax and use tax serve the same purpose, ensuring that the state collects tax revenue on all taxable transactions. However, they apply to different types of transactions, and you typically do not have to pay both taxes on one transaction. If sales tax is properly collected at the time of purchase, use tax does not apply. Conversely, if sales tax is not collected, then you may be responsible for reporting and paying use tax."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved.

Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","output":"Bakso is a popular Indonesian dish that originates from the region of Indonesia, a culturally rich and diverse country located in Southeast Asia. This beloved dish is made with an assortment of ingredients that come together to create a savory and flavorful experience for the consumer. The main ingredients in Bakso include ground beef, tapioca, noodles, rice vermicelli, beef broth, kailan (a type of Chinese broccoli), celery, salted vegetables, and fried shallots. The base of Bakso consists of ground beef, which is essential in providing the dish with its meaty and satisfying taste. The ground beef is combined with tapioca, a starchy ingredient derived from the cassava plant, which serves as a binder and gives the meatballs a unique texture. Tapioca also adds some nutritional value to the dish, as it is an excellent source of carbohydrates and essential minerals like iron and calcium.  Another key component of Bakso is noodles, which can vary depending on regional preferences and personal tastes. Rice vermicelli, a type of thin rice noodle, is commonly used in Bakso. It contributes a delicate texture, making the dish more enjoyable and filling. Besides, rice vermicelli is a healthier alternative to many other types of noodles, as it is gluten-free and has a low glycemic index, hence suitable for those watching their carbohydrate intake.  To create a rich and flavorful broth that complements and enhances the taste of the meatballs and noodles, beef broth is used as the foundation. Known for its deep, savory flavor and abundance of essential nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and amino acids, beef broth not only adds delectable taste to the dish but is also beneficial for maintaining overall health. Incorporating various vegetables into Bakso enhances its nutritional value and provides an array of flavors and textures for a more balanced and satisfying meal. Kailan is a type of Chinese broccoli commonly used in Bakso for its tender yet crunchy texture and signature earthy flavor. Celery lends a refreshing and crisp taste to the dish, while salted vegetables provide a pleasant, briny contrast to the rich and savory flavors of the meat and broth.  Finally, fried shallots serve as a garnish and aromatic ingredient for Bakso, offering a delightful crunch and a subtle yet rich onion-like taste. The aroma from the fried shallots adds an additional layer of depth and complexity to the dish, making it even more inviting and enjoyable for all to savor. In conclusion, Bakso is a beloved Indonesian dish that showcases the depth of flavors and culinary ingenuity of the region. Its unique combination of ingredients, such as ground beef, tapioca, rice vermicelli, beef broth, kailan, celery, salted vegetables, and fried shallots, creates a sumptuous and comforting meal, rich in both taste and nutrition, which has become a staple in Indonesian cuisine and continues to be celebrated and relished by food lovers alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading... According to the above context, answer the following question. The senior research associate probably feels: A:","output":"Based on the context provided, we can infer that Jacob Kang-Brown, the senior research associate at the Vera Institute for Justice, likely has complex feelings about the situation. He acknowledges the significant decline in the U.S. prison population, likely viewing it as a positive development, credited to the federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade.  However, he also expresses a degree of caution, indicating that it's unclear whether this decrease in prison populations will continue. His remark implies a sense of guarded optimism, or perhaps uncertainty or concern about the sustainability of the trend. Kang-Brown also seems to perceive this reduction in population as a form of 'relief' for communities, which suggests a level of empathy towards those who are affected by incarceration, including the prisoners themselves, their families and their respective communities. Moreover, his admonition to \\"continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change\\" suggests that he views an ongoing, persistent effort as a crucial component of ensuring further reduction and lasting change. This sentiment conveys a sense of commitment, responsibility and active involvement in the reform work. It is plausible to hypothesize that he experiences some frustration at the challenges they face in maintaining this momentum, but this is not explicitly mentioned. He does not directly reference President Trump's proposals for helping former inmates reintegrate into society, but given his clear engagement with the issue of criminal justice reform, it is likely that he has thoughts on this initiative as well. Whether he views it positively or negatively, though, would be pure speculation without more context.  In summary, it seems probable that the senior research associate embodies a mix of emotions- optimism at the progress already made, caution about the future, empathy for those affected, commitment to the cause, and potentially frustration at pervasive challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"Before leaving Warsaw when did Chopin first become immortalized in art?\\"  Context: \\"In 1827, soon after the death of Chopin's youngest sister Emilia, the family moved from the Warsaw University building, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace, to lodgings just across the street from the university, in the south annex of the Krasiński Palace on Krakowskie Przedmieście,[n 5] where Chopin lived until he left Warsaw in 1830.[n 6] Here his parents continued running their boarding house for male students; the Chopin Family Parlour (Salonik Chopinów) became a museum in the 20th century. In 1829 the artist Ambroży Mieroszewski executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members, including the first known portrait of the composer.[n 7]\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Before leaving Warsaw, Chopin first became immortalized in art in 1829. This significant milestone in his life occurred when the artist Ambroży Mieroszewski executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members. Among these portraits, the first known portrait of the composer, Frédéric Chopin, was created. Chopin's early life was shaped by his family's dedication to music, which became evident when they moved to lodgings across the street from the university in the south annex of the Krasiński Palace on Krakowskie Przedmieście in 1827. Previously, the Chopin family resided in the Warsaw University building, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. The reason for the move was due to the untimely death of Chopin's youngest sister, Emilia, which led the family to seek a change in scenery. In their new residence, Chopin's parents continued to run their boarding house, predominantly catering to male students. This place, known as the Chopin Family Parlour (Salonik Chopinów), later became a museum in the 20th century, showcasing the family's significant impact on Polish culture and the artistic development of young Chopin. As a rising composer and pianist, Chopin had already built a solid reputation within Warsaw's artistic circles by the time Mieroszewski painted his portrait. Capturing the essence of Chopin's connection to music, the portrait not only highlights his talent but also serves as a historical record of a young composer on the cusp of international acclaim. The portrait's creation in 1829 marked the beginning of Chopin's immortalization in the world of art, shedding light on his early life and family. It serves as a testament to the supportive environment in which he was raised and the impact it would have on his career. Just a year after the portrait was painted, in 1830, Chopin left Warsaw to embark on a journey that would further cement his status as one of the most renowned composers and pianists in history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Karate Kid Context: Twelve-year-old Dre Parker and his mother Sherry Parker move from Detroit to Beijing after Sherry gets a job transfer at her car factory. After a day in a Chinese park, Dre develops a crush on a young violinist, Meiying, who reciprocates his attention, but Cheng, a rebellious kung fu prodigy whose family is close to Meiying's, attempts to keep the two young ones apart by violently attacking Dre, and later bullies him at school, as Dre is too weak to stand up for himself. During an attack one day, the maintenance man, Mr. Han, comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as an ancient kung fu master. After Han mends Dre's injuries using fire cupping, Dre asks if Mr. Han could teach him kung fu to get revenge on his attackers. Han refuses, but meets Cheng's teacher, Master Li, to make peace. Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. Seeing a poster for an open martial arts tournament, Han instead proposes that Dre compete against Li's students there. He also requests that the stronger students that Li teaches leave Dre alone to train in time for the tournament, in hopes Dre will no longer be bullied. Li accepts the offer, but tells Han that if Dre does not show up, there will trouble for both Han and Dre. Han promises to teach Dre \\"real\\" kung fu and begins to train Dre by emphasizing movements that apply to life in general, and that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial art. He teaches this by having Dre go through various actions with his jacket, which teaches Dre muscle memory moves. Han then takes Dre to a divine temple in the Wudang Mountains where he trained with his father hundreds of years ago, and Dre witnesses a woman making a king cobra reflect her movements, and Dre and drinks the water from a secret, ancient Chinese well for good luck. As Dre's relationship with Meiying continues, he persuades her to cut school for a day of fun, but when she is nearly late for her violin audition which was brought... A:","output":"In the movie \\"The Karate Kid,\\" Dre Parker, the protagonist, severely hurts his leg. The injury occurs during the martial arts tournament when he goes up against Cheng, the kung fu prodigy who has been bullying him throughout the film. This climactic battle is significant for Dre as it tests his resolve and determination in the face of adversity. Dre's leg injury happens when Cheng lands a kick on it, causing Dre to fall and struggle to stand up. Despite his obvious pain, Dre manages to find the strength to continue fighting, relying on the kung fu teachings of Mr. Han, who has trained him not just in self-defense but also in self-discipline, and the importance of serenity and maturity in martial arts. Mr. Han, who has been a father figure to Dre throughout the story, treats his injuries after each encounter with Cheng and his gang. With the leg injury during the tournament, Dre demonstrates that he is no longer the weak and defenseless boy he was before and that he has learned from Mr. Han's training. The tournament serves as a turning point for Dre, as the previously bullied and fearful child is now confident and courageous in the face of adversity. Dre's success in the tournament also helps to change Cheng's attitude toward him, as Cheng finally respects Dre's abilities and demonstrates sportsmanship by handing him the trophy. In addition to Dre's leg injury, the training he undergoes with Mr. Han helps him to develop character, learn valuable life lessons, and understand that true martial art mastery is not just about physical prowess, but also mental and emotional maturity. This shift in Dre's perspective ultimately enables him to find inner strength and face his fears, resulting in personal growth and the ability to foster healthier relationships with others, including Meiying, the girl he has been pursuing throughout the film. As evidenced in \\"The Karate Kid,\\" the injuries Dre sustains aren't just physical; they also serve as an important catalyst for his personal transformation, allowing him to evolve from a vulnerable, bullied child into a determined and wise martial artist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Elite names, such as world number one and defending champion Dustin Johnson, are guaranteed their place, indeed the top 60 in the world are all automatically eligible. But this is an event that does what it says on the tin. It is \\"open\\" to the lower echelons who have earned their chance to rub shoulders with the big boys at Erin Hills this week. From the 8,979 professional and amateur golfers who teed it up in local qualifying, 525 progressed to be part of the 902 who competed at the sectional stage, which in turn yielded 72 with a golden ticket to the second major of the year. These include 22-year-old Aaron Rai from Wolverhampton, who won the European sectional tournament at Walton Heath. It was this qualifier that produced the eventual champion, Michael Campbell, in 2005. Scotland's Richie Ramsay, Bradley Dredge of Wales and Englishmen Andrew 'Beef' Johnston, Matt Wallace and Eddie Pepperell were also among the 15 who progressed from the 36-hole tournament. Of those British qualifiers, Pepperell's is perhaps the most heart-warming story. The 26-year-old, who was prominent on the 2015 Open leaderboard at St Andrews, is emerging from a torrid spell in which he was forced to return to Tour School to retain his European Tour card. \\"The last year has been a bit of a struggle and I lost a lot of confidence,\\" Pepperell told BBC Sport. After finishing eighth in last year's Irish Open, he missed 16 cuts in 21 tournaments, tumbling from a career-high of 80th in the world to outside the top 500. \\"There have been times where I've gone home quite stressed and, yeah, feeling a bit low,\\" said Pepperell. \\"And you have some alcohol or whatever just to get away from it, and I've experienced what it's like to live under a bit of stress. \\"It's all part and parcel of life and makes the good times all the more enjoyable.\\" At Walton Heath, Pepperell carded rounds of 67 and 66 to book his place in Wisconsin, before continuing his fine form with a top-10 finish at the Nordea Masters later that week. \\"Qualifying for the US Open, having my dad and family there and seeing them smiling, knowing they'll come over to America and have a great time, it was really nice. We are going to enjoy it,\\" he said. The Oxfordshire pro credits a change of clubs and ball as the main reasons for his return to form. \\"Modern equipment is just designed to go further, through a higher launch angle with less spin off the tee and that's never really been my game,\\" Pepperell said. \\"I'm a natural, feely kind of player and I've learned that I actually need some backspin on my driver so I know when I'm on the tee and not feeling very comfortable I can tee it down low and squeeze one out there and get it in play.\\" Anyone who reads Pepperell's regular and honest blogs knows the former British amateur international sees more to life than bashing balls and holing putts. But coping with the demands of the toughest of the majors will be uppermost in his mind this week in what will be his second US Open, having qualified for Merion in 2013. Erin Hills is a monster that can play anything up to 7,800 yards. It is the first par-72 course to stage America's national championship since Pebble Beach in 1992. \\"The way I see it, every tee shot is hard, every approach shot is hard, the whole week is hard,\\" Pepperell said. \\"There's just constant pressure, a constant need to hit really good golf shots. In many ways I think it brings the best out of you because you know what you have to do. \\"The way you react is the key. You either become afraid or think 'you know what? I've got nothing to lose here'. \\"I'm just going to try and make great swings for four days and let's see what happens. \\"In my two American majors so far I have putted really poorly, so most of my preparation will be around long-range and short-range putting. You are going to have to hole those six-footers.\\" This will be the mantra for much of the field, regardless of their background. Johnson's length off the tee and outstanding form since breaking his major duck 12 months ago make him a justifiable favourite. But defending champions rarely fare well. Tiger Woods (tied sixth in 2009) is the only one to make the top 10 since Curtis Strange retained his title in 1989. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy has played only 72 competitive holes since the Masters following the recurrence of his rib problems and will do well not to be undercooked. Having said that, he has had plenty of opportunity to work on his short game, which will be such a vital component. With four par-fives at Erin Hills, the other key areas are driving distance, and approach play from 100 yards and in. Looking at statistics covering these areas, a shortlist of leading exponents includes Americans Justin Thomas, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth and Brendan Steele, and Spain's Masters winner Sergio Garcia. McIlroy and Johnson also show up well statistically, and if Jason Day can find his touch on the greens, this looks an ideal test for the Australian, who has yet to fire this season. But the penal nature of the US Open makes patience an important virtue and this is an undoubted strength of 2013 winner Justin Rose. As he prepares for his fourth major, Pepperell insists he will not be daunted by the strength in depth at the top of the game. \\"I don't really care whether I'm chipping next to Rory McIlroy or my dad to be honest,\\" he said, laughing. \\"It's just one of them is better at golf than the other. \\"For me it's not the players, it's the crowds, the atmosphere, the hum, the whole environment. It's completely different to what we are used to. \\"In Europe I played an event and I was third and there were two people watching and I was thinking, 'well this isn't very inspiring', and this week I could have 2,000 people watching me on the first tee.\\" The same applies to all those who have earned their crack at a week of genuinely big-time golf - no matter how tortuous their route to get there.

However, the given hypothesis \\"Concerts are held fortnightly, except during winters, and all weekend evenings during festivals\\" contains more specific details that the premise doesn't directly address. Based on the premise, we can deduce the following facts: 1. The Ross Open Air Bandstand is situated at the center of some gardens. 2. It hosts free concerts throughout the year. 3. The number of concerts held tends to increase during the festival season. While we can infer that concerts are organized at the bandstand throughout the year, and the frequency of these concerts likely increases during festival times, we don't have enough information to determine if the concerts follow the specific pattern described in the hypothesis (fortnightly schedule, the exclusion of winter season, and weekend evenings according to festival timetables). We also cannot determine from the premise if the concert scheduling aligns with the details of the hypothesis or if the venue is closed for all concerts during winters. Consequently, the hypothesis that \\"concerts are held fortnightly, except during winters, and all weekend evenings during festivals\\" might be accurate or merely speculative. To confirm or refute the hypothesis, further information would be needed, such as historical data or a direct inquiry with the organization responsible for scheduling the concerts at Ross Open Air Bandstand. Only with more conclusive evidence or documentation can we determine whether the details provided in the hypothesis are entirely consistent with the concert scheduling and organization.

What does an arenophile collect????","output":"An arenophile is a person who has a keen interest in and collects sand from various locations, particularly beaches, deserts, dunes, and riverbanks. This unique hobby, also known as psammophile or sand collecting, often involves gathering sand samples from different parts of the world, documenting their origins and characteristics, and ideally preserving them in a well-organized manner. Arenophiles appreciate the intricate beauty, texture, color, and composition of sand, which can vary widely from one location to another. They may also study sand's geological, biological, and cultural significance. An arenophile's collection may showcase a wide range of sand samples, each with distinctive features, such as: 1. Color: The color of sand can differ vastly depending on its mineral composition, organic materials, and geological history. It can range from white, cream, beige, and various shades of brown to striking hues like pink, red, green, black, or even purple. 2. Grain size: Sand grains can vary from very fine to coarse, which affects the sand's overall texture. The grain size typically results from processes like erosion, sediment transport, and deposition. 3. Composition: The mineral content of sand varies depending on the source rocks and geological processes. Most sands primarily consist of quartz, while some might contain minerals like feldspar, olivine, and magnetite, or even shell fragments and coral. 4. Shape: The shape of sand grains can provide valuable clues about their origin and transport history. For example, angular grains may indicate a relatively young and nearby source, while well-rounded grains suggest long-distance transport and a more extended history of erosion and abrasion. Arenophiles often employ specific methods and materials to preserve and showcase their collection. A common method is to store the sand samples in small, transparent containers or vials and label them accordingly. These containers may be stored in boxes, on shelves, or displayed in an exhibit. Many arenophiles also maintain a catalog or database that includes the sand's origin, collection date, physical and geological properties, and any anecdotal or historical information related to the sample. Some arenophiles may take their passion for sand collecting a step further by participating in online forums, social media groups, or clubs dedicated to the hobby. These platforms allow sand collectors to exchange samples, share collecting tips and experiences, and discuss the unique properties and fascinating stories behind different sand samples. In summary, an arenophile is an individual who collects sand samples from various locations. They appreciate the myriad properties of these geological materials, such as color, grain size, composition, and shape. Arenophiles meticulously preserve, organize, and document their sand collections and may engage with other collectors to share their knowledge, experiences, and samples. This captivating hobby allows arenophiles to explore the diverse and beautiful world of sand and gain a deeper appreciation for the incredible geological and biological processes that shape our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      Nov. 16, 2015, 9:10 PM GMT / Updated Nov. 16, 2015, 10:29 PM GMT By Maggie Fox      Researchers have found even more evidence that coffee can be good for you. People who drink regular, moderate amounts of coffee are less likely to die from a range of diseases, from diabetes to heart disease.      The cutoff seems to be around five cups a day, and even decaf coffee helps, the team at Harvard University’s school of public health found.      But even heavy coffee drinking doesn’t appear to offset the damage caused by smoking, they report in the journal Circulation.      “The main message is that regular consumption, meaning three to five cups of coffee a day, is associated with lower risk in total mortality and mortality from several causes like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and suicide,” Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology who helped lead the study, told NBC News.      “In previous studies on that issue, most of the coffee was caffeinated coffee. In our study, both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee showed a lower mortality risk but there is no final conclusion yet.”      \\"In our study, both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee showed a lower mortality risk.\\"      Hu and colleagues looked at two giant sources of information: surveys of more than 200,000 doctors and nurses who have regularly updated researchers on their eating and other lifestyle habits and details about their health for more than 20 years.      Coffee drinkers overall were less likely to die over the decades than non-drinkers. The effects were even stronger and clearer when the team discounted smokers. Non-smokers who drank coffee were between 8 and 15 percent less likely to die, depending on how much they drank.      “This is good news for people who drink coffee because the evidence is strong. Drinking coffee may be good for health outcome,” Hu said.      It’s not a clear correlation. People who drink more coffee also are more likely to smoke, drink, and to eat red meat. Other lifestyle habits may also go along with heavy coffee drinking, and the researchers didn’t report on whether people drank their coffee black, with cream, with sugar, or as giant frothy drinks from coffee store chains.      “We are not advocating coffee as a strategy for prevention of the chronic diseases because coffee drinking is individual behavior and there are other factors in the diet that have a bigger effect. People should also be aware of the amount of added sugar to coffee drinks which can become a problem,” Hu said.      What could coffee be doing for health? The dark drink is the No. 1 source in the American diet of antioxidants – those chemical compounds that fight the damage to your DNA caused by day-to-day living.      “The main message is that people who enjoy drinking coffee should not worry about it being harmful for their health.\\"      Other research has found evidence that coffee can help people recover from colon cancer, lower diabetes risk and reduce the inflammation associated with diabetes and heart disease.      Advisers to the U.S. government say new dietary proposals should mention the benefits of coffee, which include protection against diabetes, Parkinson's and liver cancer.      “The chlorogenic acid, lignans, quinides, trigonelline, and magnesium in coffee reduce insulin resistance and systematic inflammation,” the researchers wrote.      “This is probably the best study we are going to get because of the very large numbers, the inclusion of men and women, and the decades of follow-up,” said cardiologist Dr. Sharonne Hayes of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, who wasn’t involved in the study.      “The main message is that people who enjoy drinking coffee should not worry about it being harmful for their health,” Hayes told NBC News. “Coffee may actually be beneficial to their health.” ||||| Drink To Your Health: Study Links Daily Coffee Habit To Longevity      Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto      If you have a daily coffee habit, here's something to buzz about: A new study finds those cups of joe may help boost longevity.      \\"In our study, we found people who drank three to five cups of coffee per day had about a 15 percent lower [risk of premature] mortality compared to people who didn't drink coffee,\\" says one of the study authors, nutrition researcher Walter Willett of the Harvard School of Public Health. Decaf drinkers also saw benefits.      The findings, published in the journal Circulation, build on a body of evidence linking a coffee habit to potential health benefits.      As we've reported, previous research has pointed to a decreased risk of stroke. And, there's some evidence that a coffee habit cuts the risk of Type 2 diabetes, too.      Now, of course, it's possible to overdo it with caffeine. Research has shown that consuming more than 400 milligrams of caffeine can interfere with sleep and create feelings of unease. And some of us are even more sensitive. (I feel jittery if I have more than one strong cup!)      One study found that 200 milligrams of caffeine (the equivalent of about two cups of coffee) is an optimal amount to enhance cognitive function and mood among sleep-deprived people. But we don't all metabolize caffeine the same way.      As we've reported, the caffeine amounts in coffee vary wildly. One analysis, conducted by Bruce Goldberger, found a 16-ounce cup of caffeinated coffee from Starbucks could contain anywhere from 250 milligrams to more than 500 milligrams of caffeine.      \\"Not everyone reacts to coffee in the same way,\\" says Andrew Maynard, who studies risk assessment at Arizona State University. He summarizes the benefits documented in this study as \\"small.\\"      He says this study does not prove cause and effect between drinking coffee and living longer. Rather, it points to an association. \\"There are a lot of unknowns as to what [may explain] the increase in life expectancy,\\" Maynard says.      Got more questions? So did we. Here's our conversation about the findings with study co-author Walter Willett, edited for length and clarity.      So, what do you think might explain this association? In the study, you point to compounds in coffee — such as lignans, quinides and magnesium — that may help reduce insulin resistance and inflammation. Prior studies have pointed to these as well.      We're not sure exactly how coffee is [linked] to all these benefits. The coffee bean itself is loaded with many different nutrients and phytochemicals. And my guess is that they're working together to have some of these benefits.      We [see] similar benefits from caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. That's important, because it suggests that caffeine is not responsible for [the benefit].      So this may be welcome news to people who drink decaf?      Yes, because too much [caffeinated] coffee can cause insomnia and loss of sleep, and that's not a good thing!      The reduced risk of death was not seen among the coffee drinkers in your study who were smokers or former smokers.            Definitely. It's extremely important to disentangle the effects of coffee from the effects of cigarette smoking.      So, what's the take-home here? Is it that coffee can be part of a healthy lifestyle?      I think if people like coffee, it's fine to include it [as part of your daily habit]. So, certainly, [people] should not feel guilty about moderate coffee consumption. It definitely can be part of a healthy lifestyle.      I wouldn't suggest that someone who doesn't like coffee go out and drink it.      Are you a coffee drinker? Are these findings likely to influence your own behaviors?      Well, I really like a good cup of coffee. But if I have more than two cups a day, I really don't sleep as well. So, I've been switching more toward decaf or half decaf/half regular.      In this study, you also analyzed how coffee influenced the risk of specific diseases — or categories of diseases. What did you find?      We went beyond total mortality and looked at specific causes of death. And we found that people who drink moderate amounts of coffee have lower risk of [death] from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurologic disease [such as Parkinson's] and suicide.      Your findings come from data from two Nurses' Health Studies, which included about 167,000 women. And it also looked at the 40,000 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.      As you point out, the participants in these studies are about 95 percent white, largely middle-class and well-educated. Can you extrapolate to other populations?      Yes, I'm quite sure these findings would apply to other populations. This is a biological relationship. And we basically have a common biology. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A new study by Harvard University's School of Public Health has found that people who drink regular, moderate amounts of coffee are less likely to die from a range of diseases, including diabetes and heart disease, with the optimum amount being around five cups a day for both caffeinated and decaffeinated drinkers.

She had never believed that Winston would leave her side, especially not in the dead of the night. However, there was always that nagging fear that maybe, just maybe, it could happen. They had been through so much together – the abandoned puppy that had stolen her heart, the long walks in the park, and the countless hours of laughter and play.  But over the years, Winston had grown from a clumsy, playful pup into a wise, reliable companion. He had proven time and time again to be her most trustworthy ally, never one to desert her. She could remember the dark days, when life had thrown one too many curveballs her way, and Winston had been there to provide a steady, comforting presence, letting her know that she was never truly alone. As she swept the covers aside and stepped onto the cold floor, she began to wonder if perhaps her dream had just felt all too real. She could still feel the unsettling sense of dread that had enveloped her as she awoke, moments ago. Shaking away the last tendrils of her nightmare, she descended the stairs towards the kitchen, following the scent of freshly brewed coffee. And there he was, sprawled across the kitchen floor, tail wagging, tongue hanging out in an all-too-familiar grin. Winston had not left her side, after all. But why then, had he not been at the foot of her bed, like he always was? As she approached the kitchen, she noticed that the back door was wide open. A sense of relief surged through her as she realized that her doting companion had simply gone out for his morning routine. She could see the path he had taken through the dew-kissed garden, a small trail of paw prints leading the way. The sight of Winston, alive and well, lying there with a joyous expression, brought a smile to her face. She lowered herself to the ground, running her fingers gently through his soft fur. He looked up at her lovingly, and for a moment, everything seemed right in the world. She realized that, even though they had shared years of cherished moments and memories, the thought of Winston leaving her side had managed to seep into her subconscious and nest itself amidst the dark and unwarranted fears we all carry within us. In a way, it was a reminder of the fragility of life, and that nothing was ever entirely certain. With a newfound appreciation for the bond they shared, she vowed to treasure each and every moment spent with Winston, knowing that their time together, no matter how long, would always be an irreplaceable gift. As they exchanged loving glances, she knew, in her heart of hearts, that Winston would always stay true to his unwavering loyalty. She laughed at herself for ever entertaining the thought that Winston would leave her. With her faithful pup by her side, they enjoyed breakfast and prepared for their daily walk, setting off happily through the sunlit streets, confident that the bond they shared would see them through whatever life chose to throw their way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the following context:  After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person who had his appendix removed in April 1927?

The clamp spring jumped out of position and I could not get it back in place. The swivel action on the second lamp went south shortly after. The lamp had one position after that.. facing \\"south\\". Good idea, but poor construction. Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The reviewer experiences several issues with the Clip On Bed Lamp, which indicate that the product is not durable or well-built. The reviewer bought two of these lamps, and each one had different problems that rendered them less useful or completely unusable. The first issue the reviewer encountered was with the clamp spring of one lamp. It jumped out of position, and the reviewer found it impossible to put it back in place. This indicates that the construction of the lamp is defective or poorly designed, as a crucial component (the clamp spring) did not function as it should, and it was not easy for the reviewer to fix the problem themselves. The second issue the reviewer faced was with the swivel action on the other lamp. The swivel action is an important feature of this type of product for adjusting the direction of the light according to the user's preference or need. However, in this case, the swivel action ceased to function properly after a short period, leaving the lamp stuck in one position. This further indicates that the product might not be built with high-quality materials or proper construction techniques, leading to its failure in providing the functionality required by the user. The reviewer concludes their review by saying that the Clip On Bed Lamp had a good concept, but the poor construction makes it a disappointing purchase. This statement clearly expresses their dissatisfaction with the product and indicates that they do not recommend it to others. Overall, this product review is undeniably negative due to the multiple issues encountered by the reviewer and the frustration expressed in relation to the product's poor construction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  In which case the reactants concentration would decrease, case A or case B?  Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. Answer:","output":"In case A, the forward reaction is favored. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease.

Like Joe: 'Как и Джо' - The Russian equivalent for \\"Like Joe\\" is \\"Как и Джо\\" нere, where \\"как\\" means \\"like\\" and \\"и\\" is used to connect elements with similarity. 2. he is fond of jazz: 'он увлекается джазом' - \\"he is fond of\\" translates to \\"он увлекается\\", where \\"он\\" means \\"he\\" and \\"увлекается\\" means \\"is fond of\\". \\"Jazz\\" translates to \\"джаз\\" in Russian. To say \\"fond of jazz\\", we use \\"увлекается джазом\\" using the instrumental case to show preference. 3. he studied law: 'он изучал право' - \\"he studied\\" translates to \\"он изучал\\" where \\"он\\" means \\"he\\" and \\"изучал\\" means \\"studied\\". \\"Law\\" translates to \\"право\\" in Russian. 4. and: 'и' - The Russian equivalent for \\"and\\" is \\"и\\". 5. he knows America: 'он знает Америку' - \\"He knows\\" translates to \\"он знает\\" where \\"он\\" means \\"he\\" and \\"знает\\" means \\"knows\\". \\"America\\" translates to \\"Америка\\" in Russian, and in this case, it's in the accusative case. 6. and the Americans: 'и американцев' - \\"And\\" translates to \\"и\\". \\"Americans\\" translates to \\"американцы\\" in Russian but in this context, the case of the noun changes to the accusative, which is \\"американцев\\". 7. quite well: 'хорошо' - \\"Quite well\\" can be translated as \\"хорошо\\" in Russian, it means \\"well\\" but it's common to use for both well and quite well meanings.

Can we infer the following? Hinckley Jr. liked to shoot guns.","output":"While it may be tempting to make quick inferences from the limited information available, it is essential to dig deeper into the context surrounding John Hinckley Jr.'s attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, before drawing definitive conclusions about Hinckley's motivations or preferences. John Hinckley Jr. fired six shots at President Reagan and members of his entourage, injuring the president and three others outside the Washington Hilton Hotel. To understand the reasoning behind Hinckley's actions, we must address his mental health, the influence of popular culture, and his obsession with a particular individual, rather than merely focusing on an apparent affinity for firearms. Hinckley, diagnosed with depression, schizophrenia, and narcissistic personality disorder, had a deep obsession with actress Jodie Foster. This fascination began after he watched the film \\"Taxi Driver,\\" in which the main character, Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro, attempts to assassinate a presidential candidate. Foster portrayed a young prostitute named Iris in the film. Hinckley believed that by emulating Bickle's actions, he would achieve notoriety and impress Foster, thereby winning her affection. Hinckley's mental instability and warped perceptions of reality played a major role in the attempted assassination. Rather than a genuine interest in firearms, it was the distorted ideas fueled by his mental health issues and an unrelenting obsession with Foster that drove him to employ the use of a gun in an attempt to gain her attention. Nevertheless, it is clear that Hinckley had some proficiency in using guns, as evident from his ability to fire multiple shots in quick succession during the assassination attempt. However, this proficiency does not necessarily suggest that he had a genuine fondness for using firearms. To infer that John Hinckley Jr. liked to shoot guns based on this single event would be a hasty conclusion. The incident should be considered in light of the available information about Hinckley's mental health issues, his obsession with Foster, and his motivation to replicate the actions of a fictitious character. It is crucial to achieve a holistic understanding of the situation before drawing definitive conclusions about Hinckley's preferences or motivations."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: -  Plants start growing on or near the rocks - The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock - The plant acids dissolve the rock - The rock is broken down into smaller pieces  What might be the last step of the process?

Wade prove that fetuses are, in fact, unborn babies and as such have human rights.      \\"I will not pretend there is nothing we can do to stop this,\\" he said. \\"All American citizens should be protected,\\" and explained that many other presidents have defied Supreme Court rulings on the basis of their conscience, citing Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln.      The issue of abortion is beginning to dominate conversations on the right because of the hoax being perpetrated on it by the Center for Medical Progress.

Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.  - Stian Aarstad is a Norwegian pianist and keyboard player best known for his five - year ( 1992 -- 97 ) stint with the black metal band Dimmu Borgir during which he played keyboards and synthesizers while engendering criticism and controversy for appearing onstage and performing in a top - hat - and - cape outfit reminiscent of Jack the Ripper , while wearing minimal corpse makeup and not moving or showing any emotion . Upon joining Dimmu Borgir , he did n't listen to metal music , preferring only to listen to classical . In 1998 to 1999 , he produced a demo - EP for the unblack metal band Vaakevandring . In the 2000s , Aarstad had been the pianist for the band Enthral , but left his regular position during the recording of the band 's third album .  - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member.  - Jack the Ripper is the best known name given to an unidentified serial killer generally believed to have been active in the largely impoverished areas in and around the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. The name \\"Jack the Ripper\\" originated in a letter written by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists in an attempt to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers' circulation. The killer was called \\"the Whitechapel Murderer\\" as well as \\"Leather Apron\\" within the crime case files, as well as in contemporary journalistic accounts.  - Whitechapel is a district in the East End of London, England, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Dimmuborgir (\\"dimmu\\" \\"dark\\", \\"borgir\\" \\"cities\\" or \\"forts\\", \\"castles\\"); pronounced ) is a large area of unusually shaped lava fields east of Mývatn in Iceland. The Dimmuborgir area is composed of various volcanic caves and rock formations, reminiscent of an ancient collapsed citadel (hence the name). The dramatic structures are one of Iceland's most popular natural tourist attractions.

Race track: While a race track may have dirt, it usually doesn't have a gutter built into it to carry away water, and the term 'gutter' seems less likely in the context of a race track. 2. Bed: A bed neither has a gutter nor has rubber hitting it regularly, so this option can be eliminated. 3. Ground: The ground is a very general term and it could encompass various surfaces, including both streets and race tracks. However, since it is not specific enough and doesn't necessarily imply the presence of a gutter, it can be considered less suitable. 4. Street: A street typically has gutters built into it to carry away rainwater and other waste. Additionally, rubber in the form of car tires regularly hits the surface of a street. This option seems to be the most fitting in terms of meeting both the gutter and rubber-hitting requirements. 5. Subway: A subway is an underground transportation system, and although it could have gutters for water drainage, the rubber hitting it regularly is less likely as most subway systems use steel wheels, not rubber tires.

Article: (Reuters) - Florida lawmakers, spurred by last month’s deadly high school shooting, gave final passage on Wednesday to a bill to raise the legal age for buying rifles, impose a three-day waiting period on all gun sales and allow the arming of some school employees.      Swift action in the Republican-controlled statehouse, where the National Rifle Association (NRA) has long held sway, was propelled in large part by the extraordinary lobbying efforts of young survivors from the massacre three weeks ago at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.      But the legislation, while containing a number of provisions student activists and their parents from Parkland, Florida, had embraced, left out one of their chief demands - a ban on assault-style weapons like the one used in the Feb. 14 rampage.      The bill overcame strenuous objections to provisions permitting school staff to carry guns on the job. Critics say that will pose a particular risk to minority students, who they say are more likely to be shot in the heat of a disciplinary situation or if mistaken as an intruder.      Still, a group of families of victims and survivors of the shooting applauded the legislation’s passage in a message posted on Twitter by parent Ryan Petty, whose daughter was among those killed, and urged Republican Governor Rick Scott to sign it.      The measure will automatically become law within 15 days unless vetoed by Scott, who said on Wednesday prior to the vote that he had not yet decided whether to support the bill.      The bill’s passage signaled a possible turning point in the national debate between gun control advocates and proponents of firearms rights enshrined in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.      Related Coverage Factbox: Main provisions of Florida gun safety bill      The measure narrowly cleared the state Senate on Monday before passing in the House of Representatives on Wednesday in a 67-50 vote. Ten House Democrats joined 57 Republicans in supporting the bill, while 19 Republicans and 31 Democrats voted against it.      As legislators debated in Tallahassee, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos visited Stoneman Douglas on the first full day of classes since the shooting, while the accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz, was indicted on 17 counts of murder.      SCHOOLHOUSE “GUARDIANS”      The action by Florida’s lawmakers represented both a break with the NRA on gun sale restrictions and a partial acceptance of its proposition that the best defense against armed criminals is the presence of “good guys with guns.”      The bill would create a program allowing local sheriffs to deputize school staff as volunteer armed “guardians,” subject to special training, mental health and drug screening and a license to carry a concealed weapon. Each school district would decide whether to opt in.      Nearly all classroom teachers are expressly excluded from participating in a compromise aimed at winning support from some Democrats and Scott, a staunch NRA ally who nevertheless is opposed to arming teachers. Otherwise, only non-teacher personnel are eligible, such as administrators, guidance counselors, librarians and coaches.      Florida would join at least six other states - Georgia, Kansas, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming - with laws allowing school employees to carry firearms in public schools, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

REUTERS/Colin Hackley/File Photo      President Donald Trump has voiced support for arming teachers as a deterrent to school gun violence, though many parents, law enforcement officials and policymakers in both parties reject the idea.      “The thought of even one student being gunned down by the person responsible for educating and caring for them is just too much,” Representative Amy Mercado, a Democrat from Orlando, said during the House floor debate.      She and critics decried the lack of an assault weapons ban in the bill, though supporters noted that most school shootings in the United States are committed with handguns.      The online statement Petty posted on behalf of victims’ loved ones said: “We know that when it comes to preventing future acts of school violence, today’s vote is just the beginning of our journey.”      Scott told reporters he would “review the bill line by line” and consult with victims’ families before deciding his position.      Besides his objections to arming teachers, Scott is on record as opposed to extending Florida’s existing three-day waiting period for handgun sales to purchases of all firearms.      The bill would also raise the legal age for all gun purchases to 21. The minimum age for handguns nationally is 21, but a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle in Florida.      Cruz was 18 years old when he legally purchased the semiautomatic AR-15 assault-style rifle used in the Stoneman Douglas massacre, according to authorities.      Slideshow (5 Images)      The measure also allows police to temporarily seize guns from anyone been taken into custody for an involuntary mental examination and to seek a court order barring a person from possessing firearms if that individual is deemed dangerous because of a mental illness or violent behavior.      Cruz had a history of mental issues, numerous encounters with police and was expelled from Stoneman Douglas last year for disciplinary problems, according to authorities. ||||| CLOSE The Florida Senate passed a 400 million security package that will impose longer waiting periods for gun purchases and allow some teachers and staff to carry guns in the classroom. USA TODAY      House stands and applause Rep Jared Moskowitz when he asks them to stand with the Parkland families (Photo: James Call/Democrat)      TALLAHASSEE — The Florida House sent the state’s first gun control measures in 22 years to Gov. Rick Scott on a 67-50 vote Wednesday. The measure that also creates a school marshal program to arm classroom teachers comes three weeks after 17 were slain at a Parkland high school.      The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was Florida’s third mass shooting since 2016. Added to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in June 2016 and the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting in January 2017, 71 people have died in mass shootings.      Scott said he will read the bill and talk with family members of those killed before he decides whether to sign or veto the measure.      “I’m going to take the time to read the bill,” said Scott. “I have been clear. I don’t believe we should be arming teachers.”      Scott wants more school resource officers instead of teachers with guns. He proposed one sucg officer under control of the local sheriff for every 1,000 students.      It includes a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases, raises the minimum age to 21 to purchase a gun and gives police more authority to confiscate weapons.      The Legislature lined up behind a first-in-the-nation school marshal plan that would arm teachers after a teenager used a semi-automatic rifle to hunt down 17 students and teachers at a Parkland high school three weeks ago.

Staff members could volunteer for the program, but classroom teachers who exclusively perform instruction would be blocked from the program.      While Parkland parents got behind the bill, educators and teachers' unions voiced opposition to the plan.      “The Leon Classroom Teachers Association does not want anyone in the schools with a weapon who is not a sworn law enforcement officer,” said Scott Mazur, LCTA President. \\"There's good and bad in this bill. I guess it comes down to morals.\\"      The marshal program, which was renamed the \\"guardian program,\\" was one of three objections opponents used to try to kill the bill. Another was the House’s refusal to ban assault weapons. Others wanted to reject new restrictions on access to guns. They said they saw no need to punish law-abiding citizens for the act of a madman.      Through two days of debate, the opposition refused to stand down and Wednesday some pushed for a special session to deal with school safety and guns. Democrats huddled in the morning and voted 21-9 to vote no as a caucus.      Democratic Leader Janet Cruz advised the group to vote in their constituents' best interests.      \\"We live in America.

George Moriatis, R-Fort Lauderdale. “There is always next year, members.”      While the House debated the proposal, parents who lost children at Stoneman Douglas lobbied the governor, lawmakers and the media to approve the bill saying, \\"there is enough good in the middle of this bill that everyone can agree on.”      More: Parkland student band performs at Carnegie Hall three weeks after shooting      More: Hero student in Florida shooting rampage to sue school system      “We have different opinions, different backgrounds,” said Ryan Petty, one of the 17 Stoneman Douglas families, and signed a letter backing the proposal.      “(But) We came together and are united behind this legislation and our ask is the Florida House come together as the families have done and pass this bill,’’ said Petty, whose 14-year old daughter was killed in the shooting.      The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act provides:      • 400 million for mental health and school safety programs      • 98 million to make schools more physically secured      • 87 million to establish a Safe Schools program      • 69 million for mental health assistance      • 25 million to replace the classroom building where the massacre occurred      • 18.3 million for mobile crisis teams      • 500,000 for mental health first aid training      The measure also contains new gun regulations:      • a minimum age of 21 to purchase a gun      • a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases      • easier confiscation of firearms by law enforcement in cases of threats against individuals and public safety.      Throughout the day Republican supporters worked opponents on both sides of the aisle to not derail the proposal over Second Amendment concerns.      “It does not infringe on your constitutional rights,” said Rep. Rick Roth, R-Loxahatchee, in a rare floor speech by the first-term legislator.      “It’s better to vote yes today for something that is certain and in your hands right now,” he advised the Second Amendment advocates. “If we totally fail this year, then next year we could get something worse for you, my conservative friends, than what we have today.”      More: Oregon governor signs 'boyfriend loophole' gun bill      More: Florida students say hero teacher was really a 'coward' who left them to die      Incoming House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami, said he does not think the Legislature is done with guns and violence.      “It will continue into years to come,” said Oliva Tuesday night. “This is a conversation that just started and I think you will see it spill into future sessions.”      For now, all eyes are on Scott.      Reporters pressed him after Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting while the debate raged in the House chambers on whether he will sign a bill that allows some teachers to carry a firearm into the classroom.      In a 3-minute, 30-second exchange with reporters, Scott repeated nine times: \\"...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Today in Washington, some politicians like to suggest that the many challenges we face as a nation mean we shouldn't tackle health care reform. Nothing could be further from the truth. With more and more of America's families, businesses, and local, state and federal governments struggling with the crushing costs of health care, health care reform has never been more important. As President Obama has often said, you can't fix the economy without fixing health care. Unless we fix what is broken in our current system, everyone's health care will be in jeopardy. Health care reform is not a luxury. It is a necessity. It's important to look at the size of the problem we face and where we stand. Today, we have by far the most expensive health system in the world. We spend 50 percent more per person on health care than the average developed country, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We spend more on health care than housing or food, the McKinsey Global Institute reported. Nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured, millions more are underinsured, and they aren't the only ones who are suffering. The high cost of care is hurting all of us. A recent study by Families USA estimates that insured families pay a hidden health tax of more than 1,000 every year. The hidden tax is the amount businesses and families with insurance have to pay in insurance premiums, taxes and donations to help cover the cost of treating uninsured Americans. Health insurance premiums for families that are covered through a job at a small business have increased 85 percent since 2000, and more small businesses are thinking about dropping health insurance benefits. Nationwide, health care costs consume 18 percent of our gross domestic product. If we continue on our current path, health care costs will consume 34 percent of our GDP by 2040, and the number of uninsured Americans will rise to 72 million, according to the Council of Economic Advisers. Even though we spend more than any other nation on health care, we aren't healthier. Only three developed countries have higher infant mortality rates. Our nation ranks 24th in life expectancy among developed countries. More than one-third of Americans are obese. These statistics are the signs of a system that is both unacceptable and unsustainable. They also show us the high cost of doing nothing. If we choose the status quo, more Americans will be uninsured, costs will continue to rise, and every American's health care will be at risk. Inaction is not an option, and reform is long overdue. The Obama administration is working to enact reform that will reduce costs for families, businesses and government; protect people's choice of doctors, hospitals and health plans; and assure affordable, quality health care for all Americans. We are guided by a simple principle: Protect what works about health care and fix what's broken, and do it in a way that does not add to the deficit. The president has already introduced proposals that will provide 950 billion over 10 years in savings to finance health care reform. Much of these resources come from wringing waste out of the current system and aggressively prosecuting fraud and abuse. We will continue to work with Congress as it explores other financing options, and the president is open to ideas about how we finance health care reform. But we are not open to deficit spending. Health care reform will be paid for, and it will be deficit-neutral over 10 years. Working together, we can pass real health care reform that gives Americans the choices they deserve and the affordable, quality coverage they need. And we know they do not want us to wait. Too many people have suffered without basic medical care or paid too much for it. For years, the American people have called on Washington to meet this challenge. They have waited long enough. The time for reform is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Sebelius. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Let me simplify this for you, kiddo! This article is saying that fixing health care, which means making sure everyone can afford to see a doctor and get medicine if they're sick, is a very important job. Some people in Washington, where big decisions are made, don't want to do this job because it's a really big one. But this article explains that if we don't do it, many people won't be able to afford to get better when they're sick, which could altogether make us even more sick. We already spend a lot of money on health care - more than what we spend on things like houses or food. But even though we spend so much, many people still don't have health insurance, that's like a special pass that helps you pay less when you're sick. And not having this pass means these people may not get the help they need when they're sick.  Also, even the people who do have this pass are paying more money to help cover the cost for those who don't have it - this is called a hidden health tax. So, the article is saying that we need changes. People's health is super important and we should protect it. President Obama and his team are trying to make these changes to make sure everyone can have access to good health care without spending too much money. In a nutshell, this article is saying that fixing the health care system is really important because it will help ensure everyone can get medical help when they are sick, without having to worry about it costing too much. And it's also saying that we should do this now, because it's been waiting for too long. So it's a very important job that needs to be done right away."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. \\"All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,\\" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. \\"Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\\"  Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list. Dams along the Danube River -- one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe -- have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basin's wetlands and floodplains. Even without warmer temperatures threatening to melt Himalayan glaciers, the IndusRiverfaces scarcity due to over-extraction for agriculture.

I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

Přechodná těhotěnská vyrážka Translate to English","output":"The phrase \\"Přechodná těhotěnská vyrážka\\" is in Czech, and when translated to English, it means \\"Transient pregnancy rash.\\" A transient pregnancy rash is a temporary skin condition that some pregnant women may experience during their pregnancy. This rash can be characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin. However, it is essential to note that different types of rashes can affect pregnant women, and some may have a more serious underlying cause. Therefore, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Some common rashes experienced during pregnancy include: 1. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP): This is the most common pregnancy-related rash, usually occurring during the third trimester. It often starts around the abdominal area, particularly near the stretch marks, and may spread to the thighs, buttocks, and arms. PUPPP is not harmful to the baby but can cause significant discomfort for the mother. 2. Prurigo of pregnancy: This is a less common rash characterized by small, itchy bumps that can appear anywhere on the body. It typically occurs during the second or third trimester and may last several weeks to months after giving birth. 3. Pemphigoid gestationis: A rare but more severe rash that starts with itchy, red bumps and develops into large, fluid-filled blisters. It is an autoimmune condition that can cause premature birth and low birth weight, and it requires medical attention. 4. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP): This is a liver condition that causes severe itching without a visible rash. It can be harmful to the baby, increasing the risk of premature birth, stillbirth, and fetal distress. Women with ICP should receive medical care and monitoring. Managing a transient pregnancy rash involves various approaches, depending on the cause and severity. Some general recommendations may include: - Regularly applying fragrance-free moisturizers - Avoiding harsh soaps and opting for gentle, hypoallergenic products - Wearing loose, breathable clothing - Reducing stress and practicing relaxation techniques - Applying over-the-counter anti-itch creams or ointments, as directed by a healthcare provider - Seeking medical advice for prescription medication or other targeted treatments, if necessary. While dealing with a transient pregnancy rash can be uncomfortable, it is essential to remember that most rashes resolve either during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. However, if the rash is severe, getting worse, or potentially a symptom of a more serious condition, it is crucial to contact a healthcare professional for further evaluation and appropriate care."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Mariah Carey.

Twenty years later, present day, a new family moves into Belle's childhood home, unaware of the town's tragic history. Main Characters: 1. Belle Thomas (deceased)- a talented artist full of life and dreams. 2. Max - the curious teenager of the new family who moves into Belle's house. 3. Annie - Max's younger sister with a gift for communicating with the spirit world. 4. Claire and Peter - Max and Annie's parents. 5.

As they settle in, strange occurrences begin to take place, particularly around Annie, who has a unique ability to communicate with spirits. Through her supernatural connection, she encounters the spirit of Belle and befriends her. Throughout the school year, Max and Annie uncover Belle's artistic talents and tragic story of her death, which still haunts the town. With Allison's help, they decide to put together an art exhibition at the local gallery to honor Belle's memory and celebrate her work. As they investigate Belle's death, however, they stumble upon a long-buried secret and suspect there may be more to her death than just a car accident. As the exhibition date nears, Max, Annie, and Allison investigate further, leading them to the town's sheriff - Sheriff Grant. The plot thickens as they discover Sheriff Grant was in a romantic relationship with Belle when he was still a deputy. However, the late reveal of a letter written by Belle and an authentic account from a mysterious eyewitness compels the trio to suspect that Sheriff Grant was somehow involved in the accident. The art exhibition becomes a huge success, as Belle's spirit brings the town together in a bittersweet celebration of her life. Max, Annie, and Allison finally confront Sheriff Grant, forcing him to reveal the true nature of Belle's accident. It turns out it was not a deliberate act but an unfortunate reaction to an intense argument between Grant and Belle that night. Filled with remorse, Grant resigns as sheriff and admits his part in Belle's accident to the town. As the family and the town come to terms with the truth and begin to heal, Belle's spirit finally finds peace and is able to move on to the afterlife - but not before leaving a profound impact on Max, Annie, and a town that will always remember her.

Article: Image copyright Uruguayan Interior Ministry Image caption Rocco Morabito had been on the run since 1994      One of Italy's most wanted fugitives has been arrested in Uruguay after 23 years on the run from convictions for mafia association and drug trafficking.      Rocco Morabito of the 'Ndrangheta organised crime gang was detained in the resort of Punta del Este.      Uruguayan police said he had been living there for more than 10 years under a false identity.      He was nicknamed \\"cocaine king of Milan\\" for his involvement in shipping the drug from South America to Italy.      The 'Ndrangheta controls much of the world's cocaine trade and police say Morabito was behind the smuggling of hundreds of kilos of cocaine from Brazil to Italy.      South American hideaway      Morabito is believed to have arrived in Uruguay in 2002.      Police arrested Morabito in a hotel in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo. But officials said he had settled in the resort of Punta del Este with false Brazilian identity papers in the name of Francisco Capeletto.

His wife was also detained.      According to his lawyer, Morabito has been leading \\"a normal life\\" since 1994 and has not engaged in any criminal activities since then.      He is currently being held in Uruguay for falsifying documents but is expected to be extradited to Italy in the coming months.      Last year, police in Italy found a 'Ndrangheta mafia boss who had been on the run for 18 years hidden in a bunker in the mountains of Calabria. ||||| Rocco Morabito, one of Italy’s most-wanted mafia bosses, slipped up by enrolling daughter at local school under real name      'Cocaine king of Milan' arrested in Uruguay after 23 years on the run      After 23 years on the run, one of Italy’s most wanted mobsters – the so-called “cocaine king of Milan” – has been arrested at a hotel in Uruguay.      Uruguayan and Italian authorities said Rocco Morabito, 50, a fugitive boss of Italy’s most powerful organised crime group, the Calabrian ‘Ndrangheta, had been living with false papers in the southern coastal resort of Punta del Esta for more than a decade.      Uruguayan police said Morabito, the target of an international arrest warrant since 1995, was detained after a six-month investigation that was triggered after he enrolled his daughter at a local school under his own name.      Morabito, who obtained Uruguayan papers after presenting a false Brazilian passport in the name of Francisco Capeletto, was arrested on Monday at a luxury hotel in Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital, along with his wife, reportedly an Angolan national.      Mafia bosses caught in Italian police raid on mountain hideout Read more      A search of his properties uncovered 13 mobile phones, 12 bank cards, two cars, 150 passport-sized photos of him in various guises plus a Portuguese passport, a quantity of jewels, about 50,000 (£38,500) in cash and a 9mm pistol, the Uruguayan interior ministry said.            In a statement, Marco Minniti, Italy’s interior minister, congratulated Italian and Uruguayan police for a joint operation that resulted in the apprehension of “the No 1 fugitive” from the ‘Ndrangheta.      Sentenced to 30 years in prison in Italy, Morabito had been sought by police since 1994 after attempting to import almost a tonne of cocaine, worth 13bn lire (£6m), into Italy from Brazil, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper.      Also suspected of transporting the drug to Milan from elsewhere in the country, he was wanted on charges of belonging to a criminal organisation devoted to international drug trafficking, the Italian interior ministry said.      Thought to have arrived in Uruguay in 2002, Morabito has has been leading “a normal life” since 1994 and has not engaged in any criminal activities since, his lawyer told Italian media.      Pending a formal Italian extradition request, he will be held in Uruguay for at least the next three months for false papers and identity theft, the Uruguayan interior ministry said.      Federico Cafiero de Raho, chief prosecutor for the Calabria region, said Morabito had played “a major role” in cocaine trafficking between South America and Milan, a distribution point for the drug to be sold elsewhere.      He described Morabito as “a key figure” in the ‘Ndrangheta mob, which controls a large part of the world’s cocaine trade.      Italian prosecutors have suggested the organisation tries to ensure the size and quality of its cocaine deals live up to dealer expectations by placing top gang bosses in Latin American so they can be closer to the drug’s producers.      The arrest ticks off one of the Italian interior ministry’s top five list of most wanted organised crime bosses, which also includes the Sicilian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro.      Last year Italian anti-mafia police caught two other fugitive ’Ndrangheta bosses after discovering them “living like animals” in a mountain hideout stocked with an arsenal of weapons.      Giuseppe Ferraro, 47, and Giuseppe Crea, 37, both high-ranking members of the organisation, had been on Italy’s list of most dangerous fugitives. Ferraro, convicted of a string of brutal murders, had been on the run for 18 years. Crea, wanted for mafia association and extortion, disappeared 10 years ago. |||||Summary:","output":"Rocco Morabito, one of Italy's most wanted fugitives, has been arrested in Uruguay after 23 years on the run.

Summarize this article: Gastroschisis is increasing among babies, especially those born to young black mothers, in the U.S. Getty Images/Blend Images      A serious birth defect that causes the intestines to hang out of a newborn’s body near the belly button area is on the rise among babies born to young black mothers in the U.S., and health officials have no idea why.      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sounded the alarm about the birth defect, called gastroschisis, in a report published Thursday that looked at data across 14 states.      Over the course of 18 years, the prevalence of gastroschisis more than doubled in the U.S., increasing among moms of every age and racial group. Among babies born to black mothers, it increased by more than 250 percent, particularly among teen mothers.            In all, 2,000 babies are born with the condition each year.      “Public health research is urgently needed to figure out the cause and why certain women are at higher risk of having a baby born with gastroschisis,\\" Coleen Boyle, director of the CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, said in a statement.      The defect occurs during embryo development when the abdomen forms incorrectly, leaving a hole for the intestines – and sometimes the stomach and liver – to extend outside of the body. Doctors can spot the condition among mothers who receive regular ultrasounds by the second trimester, and then know to be particularly careful during delivery. But the organs still can become irritated from exposure inside the uterus and can twist, swell and become infected.            Surgery, in which doctors put the organs back into the abdomen and close its walls, is necessary a few weeks after birth. Recovery takes about six weeks.      Even after surgery, some gastroschisis patients have problems eating and digesting food, which can lead to acid reflux, malnutrition or stunted growth. In some cases, the birth defect can be life-threatening.      The CDC does not know why some babies develop gastroschisis – whether it is caused by genetic or environmental factors like what a pregnant woman eats or drinks or by the medicines she takes. The number of cases did not follow the same track as the number of live births for teen moms, which actually declined during the same period.            Clarified on Jan. 21, 2016: This story has been updated to clarify where the signs of gastroschisis occur. ||||| Gastroschisis is a serious congenital defect in which the intestines protrude through an opening in the abdominal wall. Gastroschisis requires surgical repair soon after birth and is associated with an increased risk for medical complications and mortality during infancy. Reports from multiple surveillance systems worldwide have documented increasing prevalence of gastroschisis since the 1980s, particularly among younger mothers (1,2); however, since publication of a multistate U.S. report that included data through 2005 (1), it is not known whether prevalence has continued to increase. Data on gastroschisis from 14 population-based state surveillance programs were pooled and analyzed to assess the average annual percent change (AAPC) in prevalence and to compare the prevalence during 2006–2012 with that during 1995–2005, stratified by maternal age and race/ethnicity. The pooled data included approximately 29% of U.S. births for the period 1995–2012. During 1995–2012, gastroschisis prevalence increased in every category of maternal age and race/ethnicity, and the AAPC ranged from 3.1% in non-Hispanic white (white) mothers aged <20 years to 7.9% in non-Hispanic black (black) mothers aged <20 years. These corresponded to overall percentage increases during 1995–2012 that ranged from 68% in white mothers aged <20 years to 263% in black mothers aged <20 years. Gastroschisis prevalence increased 30% between the two periods, from 3.6 per 10,000 births during 1995–2005 to 4.9 per 10,000 births during 2006–2012 (prevalence ratio = 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–1.4), with the largest increase among black mothers aged <20 years (prevalence ratio = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6–2.5). Public health research is urgently needed to identify factors contributing to this increase.      To follow up on a study that included gastroschisis prevalence data from 15 states and reported a near doubling of gastroschisis prevalence during 1995–2005 (1), CDC requested updated data from each of these states for 1995–2012. Fourteen states* provided data on gastroschisis cases crosstabulated by maternal age groups (<20 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, 30–34 years, and ≥35 years) and race/ethnicity (white, black, and Hispanic, with all other racial/ethnic groups included in the total). The gastroschisis case definition was based on the British Pediatric Association Classification of Diseases code (756.71) or the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for gastroschisis (756.73, or before 10/1/2009, 756.79, with verification to confirm cases of gastroschisis, because the previous code was shared with omphalocele). Gastroschisis cases included live births, fetal deaths,† and elective terminations.§      Data were pooled at CDC, and gastroschisis prevalence was calculated for each year, maternal age group, and race/ethnicity. Prevalence was calculated as number of gastroschisis cases among all birth outcomes divided by the total number of live births. The denominators of total number of live births in the same catchment area as the birth defects surveillance program were reported by states or obtained from public use data files. Poisson exact methods were used to calculate 95% CIs for each prevalence estimate. Prevalence ratios were calculated by dividing the prevalence during 2006–2012 by the prevalence during 1995–2005, and CIs for the prevalence ratios were calculated using Poisson regression.      Because the comparison of prevalence between the two study periods involved an artificial breakpoint during the 18-year data span and only examined pooled prevalence within those periods, joinpoint regression analysis was used to identify statistically significant changes in the annual prevalence of gastroschisis over the course of the entire study period (1995–2012). Joinpoint regression initially models annual trend data by fitting a straight line (i.e., zero joinpoints). Then, joinpoints are added, one at a time, and a Monte Carlo permutation test is used to determine the optimal number of joinpoints. Each joinpoint in the final model corresponds to a significant change in the trend, and an AAPC and its 95% CI are calculated to describe how the rate changes within each time interval (3). The estimated overall percent change was calculated by first converting the AAPC to the projected single year change in prevalence and then exponentiating to the number of years studied minus one to estimate the total increase throughout the 18 years. This gives the magnitude of the increase, which is then converted to a percent increase. For example, an AAPC of 5 represents a projected single year change of 1.05, which would correspond to a 2.29-fold increase over the entire study period (1.05^17 = 2.29). This corresponds to an overall change of 129% ([2.29–1] x 100). The Joinpoint Regression Program, version 4.2.0 (National Cancer Institute), was used to conduct joinpoint regression.      During 1995–2005, 4,369 gastroschisis cases were detected among 12,014,244 live births (prevalence = 3.6 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 3.5–3.7), and during 2006–2012, 4,497 gastroschisis cases were detected among 9,264,540 live births (prevalence = 4.9 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 4.7–5.0). Comparing the two periods, gastroschisis prevalence increased 30% (prevalence ratio = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.3–1.4) during 2006–2012 compared with 1995–2005. The prevalence of gastroschisis increased over the course of the study period in each of the five maternal age groups (Figure).      Because fewer cases were detected among older maternal age groups, maternal age was collapsed into three groups (<20 years, 20–24 years, and ≥25 years) to stratify the data simultaneously by maternal age and race/ethnicity. A significant increase in gastroschisis prevalence occurred in each maternal age group from the first period (1995–2005) to the second (2006–2012) (Table). Statistically significant increases comparing the two periods were seen in eight of the nine categories of maternal age and race/ethnicity assessed. Among mothers aged <20 years and 20–24 years, significant increases were seen in all racial/ethnic groups examined. The prevalence of gastroschisis during 2006–2012 among mothers aged <20 years was higher among white mothers (18.1 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 16.7–19.7) and Hispanic mothers (16.1 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 14.9–17.3) than among black mothers (10.2 per 10,000 live births, 95% CI: 8.7–11.9); however, black mothers in this age group experienced the largest increase in prevalence, which doubled between the two study periods (prevalence ratio = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6–2.5).      Using Joinpoint regression to assess temporal trends within strata of maternal age and race/ethnicity, the AAPC indicated a significant increase in prevalence for all nine groups (Table). Zero joinpoints were identified for each of the nine strata, indicating that a single AAPC estimate was appropriate for the entire study period for each group. The two highest AAPCs among these strata were in black mothers aged <20 years and 20–24 years. The AAPCs ranged from a low of 3.1 in white mothers aged <20 years to a high of 7.9 in black mothers aged <20 years. These corresponded to overall percent increases from 1995 to 2012 that ranged from 68% in white mothers aged <20 years to 263% in black mothers aged <20 years. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, and as part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there.

Bound and helpless as he was, there was a visible repugnance on the part of the men to touch him, so great was the fear which his tremendous strength had excited.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - A dam is built in an area prone to flooding - A large amount of rain occurs - The water builds up behind the dam - The dam opens its floodgates when it starts to get full - The water flows into a river below the dam - The dam closes its gates - The dam will occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water - Eventually all of the floodwater will be slowly released into the river without causing any flood damage.  Question: suppose poor planning by city engineers happens, how will it affect DEGRADED safety from flooding.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: less Poor planning by city engineers might result in decreased safety from flooding. This could arise from various factors, including an inadequately designed or constructed dam, improper assessment of the rainfall intensity, poor assessment of the upstream and downstream area, insufficient monitoring systems to predict floods, inadequate evacuation plans, and poor maintenance practices.  In such a case, if the dam cannot store the large amounts of rainfall, it might get overfilled which increases the risk of dam failure, causing catastrophic flooding downstream. On the other hand, the dam might also not open its floodgates at the right times, leading to a buildup of floodwater. If the floodwater is not gradually released properly, there is a risk of flooding the downstream areas.  Moreover, if the dam closes its gates when it shouldn't, it can cause an excess of water to build up in the reservoir, ultimately leading to dam failure or severe flooding downstream when the gates do open. The inadequate control and management of the dam can therefore lead to serious damage in downstream areas increasing the risk to safety from flooding.  Therefore, poor planning by city engineers would likely lead to less safety from flooding, not more or no effect. Without careful planning and management, the risks associated with flooding can be greatly elevated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

McKinney details her upbringing as a charismatic young beauty queen with a self-reported IQ of 168. In search of a \\"clean-cut, all-American boy\\" for a potential husband, McKinney is introduced to Kirk Anderson, a young Mormon man on the eve of his  religious mission. McKinney states that she and Anderson fell madly in love and that they were engaged to be married, but that she mistrusted the Mormon church and its hold over Anderson, declaring the church to be a \\"cult\\" that had \\"brainwashed\\" him. Former Mormon turned activist Troy Williams offers insight into Mormon practices, beliefs, and attitudes to explain how Mormonism might seem cult-like to one not raised in the religion.

Article: Like many other small boys, I was fascinated by cars, not least because my oldest brother was a bit of a car guy and subscribed to cool magazines like Car and Driver and Motor Trend. Every so often, one of those magazines would run an article on the \\"Car of the Future\\". They featured unconventional styling and things like small nuclear reactors as power sources. Yet, frankly, my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do. It goes, it stops, it burns gasoline, it plays music. I still have to steer it, and it still runs into things if I don't steer it carefully. But guess what? All of these things are subject to change in the not-so-distant future. It will still go and stop, but it may not burn gasoline, I may not have to steer it, and it may be a lot better at not running into things. Airbags aren't the be-all and end-all in safety. In fact, considering the recent news about people occasionally being killed by their airbags in low-speed collisions  ,they obviously still need some development. But they aren't going away, and in fact, you can expect to see cars appearing with additional, side-impact airbags, something some European car manufacturers already offer.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) is the protagonist, but he does not appear until after the opening credits. The cold open, which featured the assassination of the president of the fictional \\"banana republic\\" of San Marcos and a coup d'Ã©tat that brings Gen. Emilio Molina Vargas (Carlos Montalban) to power, sets up the situation in which Mellish would become embroiled. The scene was in the form of a championship boxing telecast on Wide World of Sports, with Don Dunphy as the host and Howard Cosell as the commentator.[4] Mellish is a neurotic blue collar man who tries to impress social activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) by trying to get in touch with the revolution in San Marcos. He visits the republic and attempts to show his concern for the native people. However, he is nearly killed by the local caudillo and then saved by the revolutionaries, putting him in their debt. Mellish then learns, clumsily, how to be a revolutionary. When the revolution is successful, the Castro-style leader goes mad, forcing the rebels to place Mellish as their President. When traveling back to the U.S. to obtain financial aid, he reunites with his activist ex-girlfriend and is exposed. In a classic courtroom scene, Mellish tries to defend himself from a series of incriminating witnesses, including a reigning Miss America and a middle-aged African-American woman claiming to be J. Edgar Hoover in disguise. One of the witnesses does provide testimony favorable to Mellish, but the court clerk, when asked to read back this testimony, replies with an entirely different, wholly unfavorable rendition. Mellish is eventually sentenced to prison, but his sentence is suspended on the condition that he does not move into the judge's neighborhood. Nancy then agrees to marry him. The film ends with the between-the-covers consummation of their marriage, an event that was over much more quickly than Nancy had anticipated. Like the opening scene, it was accompanied by Cosell providing commentary.

Gather materials: You will need an ice cube tray and access to clean water. 2. Check the tray: Before using the ice cube tray, ensure it is clean. If it's not clean, wash it with warm water and dish soap, then rinse thoroughly and dry. 3. Fill the tray: In most cases, an ice cube tray consists of several small compartments called cube molds. Slowly pour the water over the entire tray, allowing the water to fill each of these compartments. 4. Mind the water level: Do not overfill the tray as it will make removal of the ice cubes more difficult. Fill each compartment up to approximately 90% full, leaving room for the water to expand as it freezes. 5. Check for spills: If you overfilled any of the compartments, use a paper towel or clean cloth to wipe away any excess water. 6. Place in the freezer: Carefully transfer the filled tray to your freezer. Make sure to place it on a flat surface to avoid spills or uneven freezing. Close the freezer door to maintain the cold temperature needed to freeze the water. 7. Allow sufficient time: Let the tray sit in the freezer for a few hours, or until the water has fully frozen. The freezing time may vary depending on your freezer's temperature settings but typically takes around 4-6 hours. 8. Retrieve frozen ice cubes: Once you confirm that the water has fully frozen, remove the ice cube tray from the freezer. 9. Release the ice cubes: Gently twist the ice cube tray or push on the bottom of each compartment to release the individual ice cubes. If the ice cubes don't come out easily, you can briefly run the bottom of the tray under warm water to loosen them. 10. Store or use the ice cubes: Either place the ice cubes in a container and return them to the freezer for later use, or add them to your drinks and enjoy!

Given these facts, a platypus is an example of _. among the following options: - Marsupial.  - Monotremes.  - insects  - animals  - killing insects  - Amphibian.  - Placental mammal.  - matter vibrating A:","output":"A platypus is an example of Monotremes. Monotremes are a unique group of mammals that, as you mentioned, reproduce by laying eggs. This makes them distinct from other mammals, which typically give birth to live young. Monotremes are very rare, with only five extant species currently known to science, including the platypus and several species of echidna. Marsupials are another distinct group of mammals that are characterized by giving birth to relatively undeveloped young, which then continue to develop outside the womb, typically in a pouch on the mother's abdomen. Examples of marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, and koalas. Given that platypuses reproduce through egg-laying, they are not classified as marsupials. Insects, while also egg-laying creatures, are not mammals. They are a completely different class of animals called arthropods, characterized by their exoskeletons, segmented bodies, and jointed appendages. Platypuses, being mammals, do not have these traits and thus are not considered insects. Animals is a broad term that refers to all living organisms that are part of the kingdom Animalia. Platypuses, as mammals, are indeed members of the animal kingdom; however, this classification does not provide specific information about their reproductive characteristics, which is the focus of your question. Killing insects is an action or behavior rather than a classification, so it is not relevant when categorizing a platypus by its egg-laying reproduction. Amphibians are a different class of animals that include frogs, toads, and salamanders. They are characterized by a life cycle that involves both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and they have smooth, moist skin that aids in respiration. Platypuses, as mammals with fur and mammary glands, are not amphibians. Placental mammals are the most widespread group of mammals, characterized by developing embryos inside the mother's uterus, with nourishment provided through a specialized organ called the placenta. Since platypuses lay eggs and do not give live birth, they are not placental mammals. Matter vibrating is a concept related to the study of physics and is not applicable to the categorization of organisms such as the platypus. It refers to the movement of particles in a substance, which is unrelated to the reproduction and classification of mammals. In summary, given the characteristics of a platypus as a mammal that reproduces by laying eggs, it is most accurately classified as a monotreme."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   People often complain when the weather forecast is wrong. Weather forecasts today, however, are much more accurate than they were just 20 years ago. Scientists who study and forecast the weather are called meteorologists. How do they predict the weather?.   Q: What are scientists called who study the weather and give forecasts?   A: A:","output":"A: Scientists who study the weather and give forecasts are called meteorologists. Meteorologists are experts in the field of atmospheric science, which is the study of Earth's atmosphere, its processes, and the resulting weather conditions. Meteorologists use a variety of tools and techniques to observe and forecast the weather. They gather data from various sources, including satellites, weather stations, radar systems, and ocean buoys, which provide information on temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and other atmospheric factors. This continuous flow of data enables meteorologists to track weather patterns, monitor changes, and make predictions based on this information. In addition to gathering data, meteorologists rely on computer models to simulate the behavior of the atmosphere. These models are based on complex mathematical equations that represent the physical laws governing the movement of air and moisture in the atmosphere. By inputting current and historical weather data into these models, meteorologists can generate forecasts which predict future weather conditions. Meteorologists also study the interactions between the Earth's atmosphere and other components of the Earth system, such as the oceans, ice sheets, and land surfaces. They investigate the role of large-scale atmospheric patterns, like jet streams, El Niño and La Niña, and the North Atlantic Oscillation in shaping weather conditions. Weather forecasts have become increasingly accurate over the years due to advancements in technology, improved understanding of atmospheric science, and enhanced computer models. Despite these improvements, weather prediction remains an inherently uncertain process, as the atmosphere is a chaotic and complex system with countless variables. Meteorologists continually strive to improve the accuracy and reliability of their forecasts through ongoing research and advancements in the field of atmospheric science. In summary, meteorologists are the scientists who study weather and provide forecasts by analyzing atmospheric data and employing computer models to predict future weather conditions. They play a crucial role in helping to prepare individuals, communities, and industries for weather events, ensuring public safety, and minimizing the potential impacts of severe weather."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Spirit tells that Ebenezer is ok, but in his past, there are other Blackadders who are quite miserly. Curious, Ebenezer asks to know more, and the Spirit goes into several flashbacks.The first vision shows how Lord Blackadder managed to con his way into great fortune and entitlement by tricking Queen Elizabeth (Miranda Richardson) into executing Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry).The second vision shows Edmund Blackadder tricking Prince Regent (Hugh Laurie) into giving up his valuable worldly goods to the poor.These visions intrigue Ebenezer, and he also wishes to see the future. However, the Spirit shows him two futures: if he becomes bad, his future descendant will become ruler of the Universe. If he stays good, he'll become the slave to the future descendant of Mr Baldrick.The Spirit of Christmas then attempts to leave, hoping that none of what Ebenezer has seen will cause him to stray from the side of good. Ebenezer claims he won't, and the Spirit departs.The next day however, it becomes apparent that Ebenezer has lied.

Article: The exterior of Apple headquarters is seen before an event to announce new products at the company's headquarters Monday, March 21, 2016, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Associated Press)      The Latest from Apple's product announcement in California (all times local):      10:40 a.m.      Apple is cutting the price of its smartwatch and introducing an array of new bands in an attempt to spur more sales of a gadget that hasn't won a big following yet.      Prices for the Apple Watch will start at 299, down from 349. Apple is also releasing a new type of wristband made of woven nylon, along with more colors for existing types of bands.      The expanded variety is designed to appeal to the roughly one-third of Apple watch owners who like to switch bands.      The highly anticipated Apple Watch was released a year ago, but sales haven't met some of analysts' more bullish predictions. While Apple hasn't released figures, IDC's analysts estimate the tech giant shipped 11.6 million watches last year.      — Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer, San Francisco      ___      10:20 a.m.      Apple CEO Tim Cook is reiterating his pledge to resist the U.S. government's demands for the company's help to unlock an encrypted iPhone used by one of the killers in the San Bernardino mass shootings.      Cook opened a product event in California on Monday by saying that Apple owes it to its customers to protect their privacy and the personal information they store on iPhones. He says he is \\"humbled and deeply gratified\\" by the outpouring of support he has received.      He has vowed to fight a federal magistrate's order requiring Apple to create special software that would override the iPhone's security features and allow the FBI to hack into the device used by the San Bernardino killer in a suspected case of terrorism.      Apple says that doing so could leave all iPhones vulnerable to future hacking attempts, although federal prosecutors contend they're only asking Apple to write code that would work with one phone to protect national security.      Federal magistrate Sheri Pym, who issued the order, will hear arguments from both sides in a Riverside, California, courtroom on Tuesday.      — Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer, San Francisco      ___      9:30 a.m.      Apple product events typically spark anticipation among tech bloggers and the company's hard-core fans. Monday's event, though, is drawing less excitement than some previous product launches.      Apple is expected to announce a smaller, 4-inch iPhone and a smaller version of the iPad Pro tablet.      But there's been no hint of any blockbuster developments, such as last year's highly anticipated Apple Watch debut. Despite speculation that Apple is working on a self-driving car or some new virtual-reality device, those are likely years away.      The event starts at 10 a.m. PDT at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters.      Gartner tech analyst Brian Blau says it's not unusual for Apple to save major announcements until the fall. He says the company's spring events are often focused on products that Apple considers important, but which may not be its biggest sellers.      — Brandon Bailey, AP Technology Writer, Cupertino, California. ||||| It’s no secret that iPad sales have been trending downward for years now, but Apple today unveiled a new 9.7-inch version of the iPad Pro that it hopes will reverse that trend.      Positioned as the second member of Apple’s iPad Pro family, the new smaller screened tablet weighs just about one pound, slightly heavier than the iPad Air 2. But not to worry, the iPad Pro really packs a whole host of compelling improvements over the iPad Air 2.      FROM EARLIER: Apple unveils the iPhone SE, the latest 4-inch iPhone      On the display front, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro screen is 40% less reflective than the iPad Air 2 while also delivering 25% more brightness. Phil Schiller also touted a new technology Apple calls True Tone display which can adjust the color temperature of the display to match the light in the room.      “It’s really natural to use,” Schiller added. “Once you use this display, you’ll never want to go back. It is quite a breakthrough.”      Underneath the hood, the new iPad Pro comes with an A9x processor along with an integrated M9 motion coprocessor for ‘Hey Siri’ support.      The new iPad Pro also packs the most advanced camera system Apple has ever packed into a tablet. Specifically, the new iPad Pro comes with a 12 megapixel iSight camera with focus pixels, true tone flash, and support for Live Photos.      The 9.7-inch iPad Pro also comes with a more advanced speaker system, Smart Keyboard support, support for Apple’s widely revered Apple Pencil, and will be available in four finishes, including a Rose Gold model.      Price wise, a 32GB model will be available for 599, with 128GB and 256GB models available for 749 and 899 respectively. Notably, this marks the first time Apple has developed a 256GB tablet.      Pre-orders for the latest addition to the iPad Pro family will begin on March 24. It will be available in stores on March 31.      Developing… ||||| The 9.7-inch iPad, the Apple tablet snuggled between the smaller mini and the big boy Pro, hasn’t been updated since 2014 with the iPad Air 2. So as some kind of mea culpa, Apple just blew up the Air line altogether with a “new” and “improved” 9.7-inch iPad Pro.      Except it’s really not very new or improved. Prior to Phil Schiller’s breakdown at today’s Apple event, there wasn’t much left to the imagination thanks to months worth of leaks and rumors. When compared to the larger iPad Pro that debuted last year, the new iPad Pro is basically different only in size.      Schiller spent time highlighting some of the new Pro’s differences anyway. For one, it has what Apple calls a “True Tone” display that can become warmer and cooler in different kinds of light thanks to ambient sensors. Neat, I guess. But clearly geared toward artists.      Advertisement      Other than its smaller dimensions, there is one noticeable hardware improvement on the new iPad. It will have a better shooter: a 12-megapixel rear camera that can also capture in 4k along with Live Photos. So basically the camera on the iPhone 6s. It makes sense if you view the Pro as a creation machine, but most people will probably never even use it.      Just Schiller doing Schiller.      But the new iPad Pro has Apple’s same powerful processor, the A9x (and M9x co-processor), and the same four speaker design that last year’s model had. There’s Pencil support and Smart Keyboard support, too. It’s all just packed in a smaller body. That’s good news for some people who found the iPad Pro hand-achingly huge and wanted something a little more traditional.      Apple says the small iPad Pro comes with silver, gold, space gray, and yes, rose gold, too. The new Pro will launch starting at 600 for 32GB and 750 for 128GB and a whopping 256GB for 900 (if that’s something you need/want), making it the most expensive 9.7-inch iPad starting price. Additionally, the 12.9-inch Pro will get the 256GB option. Like the new iPhone SE, the new Pro will be available for pre-order on March 24 and will start shipping a week later.            Now only the big question remains. Will people finally ditch their old tablets to go Pro?            iPad Pro Specs ||||| The technology company introduced a smaller iPhone, a smaller iPad Pro and new bands for the Apple Watch.      The event came a day before the company will face off against the United States government over whether or not to unlock a killer’s iPhone.      New York Times writers Brian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Vindu Goel provided reaction and analysis from the event.      We will also answer your questions about the company’s new product offerings. ||||| Apple CEO Tim Cook took the stage at Apple's Cupertino campus to introduce a smaller, four-inch version of the iPhone, called the iPhone SE.      The key marketing words for Apple products have usually been thinner, faster, bigger. IPhones have grown up over the past nine years, going from the original 3.5-inch display to the iPhone 6S Plus' 5.5-inch screen. Apple went in the opposite direction and announced a new iPhone that's actually smaller.      Cook also introduced a new iPad Pro, new Watch bands and some software updates. And he kicked off the event by previewing Apple's court battle with the FBI on Tuesday over iPhone encryption..      The 4-inch iPhone SE      The big announcement of the day was the smaller iPhone SE -- a 4-inch iPhone with updated internals.      It looks like the iPhone 5S, Apple's last 4-inch phone released in 2014, but has the same processor and graphics performance as the iPhone 6S. Inside is Apple's A9 chip, which doubles the speed of the iPhone 5S. It can use Hey Siri, the hands-free voice assistant, has a 12MP camera, and shoots 4K video. There is an NFC chip inside so the phone can work with Apple Pay.      The smaller iPhone is an attempt to appeal to fans of more pocketable devices. Last year, Apple sold 30 million phones that were 4-inches and smaller. A chunk of Apple customers have resisted upgrading to the recent 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch smartphones. According to Mixpanel, a third of iPhone owners are still using a device with a 4-inch screen or smaller.      The 16 GB iPhone SE starts at 399 but will be free with a two-year contract or 17 a month on an installment plan. The company will start taking orders for the phone on March 24, and it will be available on March 31.      New 9.7-inch iPad Pro      Apple's other big hardware news is that it took the iPad Pro and make it smaller. Also called the iPad Pro, the new 9.7-inch version includes many of the same powerful features as the larger 12.9-inch Pro model.      Inside is the same A9x chip. The screen is less reflective but brighter and has more color saturation, for all those pros using it as a primary work device. It has a true tone display that measures the color temperature of ambient light with new light sensors and adjusts the screen accordingly.      The smaller iPad Pro works with the Apple Pencil stylus and new line of snap on keyboards the company introduced in with the original iPad Pro. People really like using the cameras on their tablets, for some reason, so the new iPad Pro has a 12-megapixel camera and a LED back-facing flash.      The tablet starts at 599 for the 32 GB Wi-Fi version and 749 for the 129 GB model. In a first, Apple is offering a new larger 256 GB option that starts at 899. It comes in silver, gold, space gray and rose gold.      Apple Watch gets cheaper, more colorful      Apple (AAPL) really wants people to try out the Apple Watch. Tim Cook announced a new line of straps for the wearable, including all new woven nylon bands, a space black Milanese Loop, and additional sport and leather bands in a variety of colors.      Pretty watch straps on their own might not be enough to lure in new customers, so Apple dropped the price of the watch. It now starts at 299.      Why go small? Apple says it sold 30 million four-inch iPhones in 2015, so there's clearly demand for a smaller, cheaper iPhone.      Software Updates      The latest version of Apple mobile operating system, iOS 9.3, is available starting today. Key new features including Night Shift, which adjusts the screen for late night reading for better sleep, and finger print lock for top secret documents in the Notes app.      There is a small update for the Apple TV OS that adds folders for apps and Siri voice dictation.      It also announced a new health-related jSDK called CareKit. It's built for personal care apps. For example, a hospital might make an app to help patients taking the proper steps after a major surgery. The first application is a partnership with major universities and medical centers for monitoring Parkinson's.      Encryption      Before the iPhone SE and Watch announcement, Cook opened with what he admitted is \\"on everybody's mind\\": encryption.      \\"We built the iPhone for you our customers and we know that it is a deeply personal device,\\" said Cook. \\"For many of us the iPhone is an extension of ourselves.\\"      \\"We need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy,\\" said Cook. \\"We will not shrink from this responsibility.\\"      On Tuesday, Apple will face off against the FBI in a California court.      Related: Apple could reveal mini iPhone 5SE on March 21      Apple likes the environment      Apple brought out Lisa Jackson, its vice president of environment, to talk about a new, special Apple employee, Liam.      Liam is a custom robot that takes old iPhones apart to recycle them. While it disassembles them, it detects what components can be reused and recycled. It identifies materials in a device like gold, silver and tungsten. In the future, you might see a Liam robot doing its thing inside an Apple store.

If you're feeling extra decadent, go nuts with a bit more yolk and a little less white. Most commonly, you'd add a teaspoon or two of vanilla extract, though there are other options. Add any of the following along with the flour, after most of it is incorporated:  Vanilla extract Almond Mint or peppermint Hazelnut Fondants go wonderfully with a fruity or cocoa liquor -- any flavor that would go well with chocolate. Simply fold in 2 tablespoons of your favorite liquor after the flour goes in, then bake like normal. Some ideas include:  Chocolate, current, black raspberry, or cherry liquors Coffee spirits or liquors Tia Maria, Cointreau, and other specialty liquors. While most people need some dark chocolate to offset the sweetness of the sugar, you can mix and match milk, dark, and even white chocolate to find your favorite fondant. Simply add whatever chocolate you desire in place of the dark, and melt like normal. Want to hide some \\"crunch\\" in your fondants? Add some chocolate chips, of any type, to the cooled batter right before it goes in the oven. A fun-sized candy bar, though decadent, works well too. If you want a little more than chocolate to ooze out of your fondant, you have a few excellent choices. To make them, simply freeze the liquids like ice cubes, then plop the cube into the center of your batter by pouring half in the dish, adding the cube, then covering with batter. Try out:  Frozen peanut butter Frozen caramel sauce Frozen jelly (such as raspberry, which pairs well with the dark chocolate_ Frozen chocolate sauce (like a white chocolate center)","output":"This article discusses various ways to enhance the flavor and texture of a chocolate fondant dish using different ingredients and techniques. Egg yolks play a significant role in providing the rich, filling flavor in the dish, and using more yolk with less egg white can make the dessert even more decadent. In addition to the traditional ingredient of vanilla extract, other options such as almond, mint, peppermint, or hazelnut extract can be added alongside the flour. To complement the flavors further, a fruity or cocoa liquor can be folded into the mix after adding the flour. Examples include chocolate, currant, black raspberry, or cherry liquors, coffee spirits, and specialty liquors such as Tia Maria or Cointreau. Experimenting with different types of chocolate, such as milk, dark, or white chocolate, can personalize the fondant based on taste preferences. To achieve a varied texture, chocolate chips or small candy bars can be added to the cooled batter right before baking. For an extra surprise inside the fondant, freeze liquids such as peanut butter, caramel sauce, jelly, or chocolate sauce and place the frozen cube in the center of the batter. This creates a delicious, oozy filling that pairs wonderfully with the cake's outer layer. By incorporating these ingredients and techniques, one can create a delectable and unique chocolate fondant dessert to satisfy any palate."},{"instruction":"Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

Here is a question about this article: The outcome of the First World War was disastrous for both the German Reich and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. During the war, the Bolsheviks struggled for survival, and Vladimir Lenin recognised the independence of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Moreover, facing a German military advance, Lenin and Trotsky were forced to enter into the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ceded massive western Russian territories to the German Empire. After Germany's collapse, a multinational Allied-led army intervened in the Russian Civil War (1917–22). What is the answer to this question: When did the russian civil war take place?","output":"The Russian Civil War took place from 1917 to 1922. This conflict occurred following the October Revolution in 1917, when the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Provisional Government and established a socialist government in Russia. The civil war was fought primarily between the Bolshevik Red Army and the White Army, which comprised various anti-Bolshevik forces including monarchists, liberals, and other socialist factions. Foreign intervention by the Allied powers, as well as the involvement of various regional and ethnic groups, further complicated the conflict. The war ultimately ended in 1922, with the Bolsheviks consolidating their power and the establishment of the Soviet Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The hypothesis \\"It explores the ways fulfilled, socially satisfied people look back on their youth.\\" cannot be concluded as true based on the provided premise. The premise states that \\"It dramatizes how wanting and memory compete and explores how lonely, unhappy people mythologize their adolescence (D.T.\\" This clearly emphasizes the exploration of the feelings and memories of lonely and unhappy individuals as they look back on their adolescence. The premise's focus on the experiences and memories of those who are lonely and unhappy contrasts with the hypothesis's suggestion that the emphasis is on fulfilled, socially satisfied individuals. The two groups have distinct emotional backgrounds and are likely to have different perspectives and ways of recalling their past experiences. Furthermore, the premise also highlights the competition between wanting (desire) and memory, suggesting an exploration of how people long for things they cannot have or struggle to reconcile their present feelings with their past experiences. This theme may not be relevant or hold the same weight for individuals who are fulfilled and socially satisfied, as their experiences, desires, and memories may be more aligned. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, we cannot say that the hypothesis \\"It explores the ways fulfilled, socially satisfied people look back on their youth.\\" is true.

Nobody likes reading the same rehashed material over and over. Can we draw the following conclusion? You should only post once a day","output":"While it is important to be original and create interesting tweets on Twitter, the conclusion that you should only post once a day doesn't necessarily follow from the initial advice given. Ensuring high-quality, engaging content is key, but there are no specific rules concerning how often you should tweet to be successful on the platform. You can maintain an active presence on Twitter by following a few simple guidelines and strategies. 1. Find your niche: Determine what you are passionate about and what your followers might be interested in. Focusing on a specific topic allows you to establish your expertise and attract a dedicated audience that shares the same interests. 2. Post consistently: While there's no strict rule on the number of tweets per day, it's essential to maintain a consistent presence on Twitter. Consistency helps your followers know when to expect new content and contributes to building a loyal following. This could mean tweeting multiple times a day, or maintaining the frequency of a few tweets per week. 3. Use a content calendar: Planning your tweets in advance can make it easier to maintain consistency and post engaging content without feeling overwhelmed. A content calendar allows you to keep track of significant events, holidays, and promotions, providing ample opportunities for crafting relevant tweets. 4. Engage with your audience: Twitter is all about interaction and conversation. Responding to tweets, retweeting interesting content from others, and participating in relevant Twitter chats are ways to create an engaging presence on the platform. Additionally, actively engaging with your audience will provide you with more opportunities for content ideas and conversation starters. 5. Utilize multimedia: Incorporate a variety of content formats such as images, GIFs, videos, and links to keep your tweets visually interesting and engaging. Multimedia tweets tend to perform better and are more likely to be retweeted, increasing your tweet's visibility. 6. Monitor trending topics and hashtags: Staying updated on what's trending can help you create timely, relevant content that connects with your audience's current interests. Use popular but relevant hashtags to increase the visibility of your tweets. 7. Be authentic: Be genuine in your tweets and share your thoughts, opinions, and experiences. Your audience will appreciate your authenticity and are more likely to engage with you when you show your true personality. In conclusion, while being original and interesting are essential aspects of composing tweets, they should not be equated with limiting posts to once a day. Instead, focus on sharing relevant, engaging content consistently, using multimedia, and connecting with your audience to create a robust presence on Twitter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"A vandal who disabled five street lights in Grangemouth was fortunate not to have been electrocuted, police have said.\\"","output":"Title: Grangemouth Vandal Escapes Electrocution After Damaging Street Lights Introduction: In a reckless and dangerous act of vandalism, an unidentified individual managed to disable five streetlights in Grangemouth, putting their own life at risk. Police officials have warned that the person was extremely fortunate not to have been electrocuted while committing the crime. The incident has sent shockwaves across the community, raising concerns about public safety and the need for increased monitoring of such areas. Step 1: Discuss the incident The vandal, whose identity remains unknown, targeted five streetlights in the industrial town of Grangemouth, which is located in the Falkirk council area in Scotland. The act of vandalism appears to be deliberate, as the street lights were disabled in quick succession. This has led authorities to theorize that the individual may have been intending to create a dark environment for nefarious purposes. Step 2: Highlight the risks involved According to police reports, the perpetrator executed this act without significant injury due to sheer luck. Streetlights, which carry high voltages of electricity, pose a significant threat to anybody tampering with them. In this specific case, the vandal could have faced severe repercussions like electrocution or even death.  Step 3: Delve into public safety concerns The deliberate disabling of streetlights poses a genuine concern for public safety. Darkness can potentially encourage criminal activity, putting both residents and visitors at risk for various offences such as theft, assault, and other threats. In response to the incident, public officials and community leaders have emphasized the importance of maintaining public lighting to ensure safety and deter crime in Grangemouth. Step 4: Discuss the reactions of local officials and citizens Local representatives and residents have expressed their shock and dismay at the vandal's actions, with many declaring it both reckless and highly irresponsible. Some have called for increased surveillance in the area, while others have urged citizens to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities to the authorities.  Step 5: Summarize the situation The act of vandalism in Grangemouth has left local residents unsettled but has been a strong reminder of the importance of public safety, the dangers of tampering with electrical installations, and the need for constant vigilance within communities. Police are currently investigating the case with the aim of apprehending the perpetrator, and local authorities are working to restore the damaged streetlights as soon as possible. Conclusion: As this incident has shown, senseless acts of vandalism can pose serious threats to public safety and even endanger the life of the vandal. It is crucial for community members to remain vigilant and report such incidents to the authorities to ensure the mutual safety of all individuals residing and working in the area. The Grangemouth streetlight vandal may have escaped electrocution this time, but their actions serve as a stark warning of the potential dangers of interfering with public utilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.
